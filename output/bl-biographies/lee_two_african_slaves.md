Abstract:
Little scholarly research has been undertaken on the history of African slavery in Iran in the
nineteenth century. What has been written focuses, almost by necessity, on statistical information
or on the lives of the wealthy and powerful. Haji Mubarak and Fezzeh Khanum offer a rare
opportunity for historians of Iran to reconstruct the biographies of two ordinary slaves. Because
they were the slaves of the Shirazi merchant, Mirza ‘Ali-Muhammad, the founder of Babism,
surviving Babi and Baha’i chronicles (and oral traditions) include them in their pious histories
and record at least part of their lives. At the same time, these histories erase these persons by
steadfastly refusing to acknowledge any significance in their presence.
This paper will demonstrate that the recovery of the history of slavery in nineteenth-century Iran,
even at the level of individual biographies, is possible. It will also argue that the significance

of large numbers of African slaves in Iran during this time has been erased from contemporary
Iranian national history. Similarly, the presence of African slaves at the genesis of the Babi religion
has been erased from contemporary Baha’i histories.

Can biographies of enslaved individuals who lived in nineteenth-century Iran
be discovered and written by historians? This article will suggest that they can
be, if we look in the right places and ask the right questions. The recovery of
the history of ordinary Africans who were slaves in Iran and the history of their
cultural influence on the nation can be accomplished―not only at the level of
laws and statistics and general practices, but even at the level of individual lives.
In this article, I suggest that Haji Mubarak and Fezzeh Khanum, domestic slaves
of Mirza ‘Ali-Muhammad of Shiraz (1819-1850), a young merchant, offer a
rare opportunity for historians to reconstruct the biographies of two ordinary
persons who were enslaved in Qajar Iran. Mirza ‘Ali-Muhammad became the
prophet and founder of Babism, an Iranian religious movement and the precursor
of the Baha’i faith. Because of this special circumstance, surviving Babi and
Baha’i chronicles (and oral traditions) include his slaves in their pious histories
and record at least some parts of their lives. A careful reading of these records
will help us take a step closer to a history of enslaved Africans in nineteenth-
century Iran.

A study of Baha’i histories (until recently, regarded as taboo in Iranian his-
toriography) can provide unique information on these two individuals and on
the history of slavery in Iran, if the texts are read critically. Enslaved persons
were erased from Baha’i histories in the same way that other Africans have been
erased from secular Iranian histories. Baha’i historians recorded their presence

as non-persons, but ignored them as actors in history by steadfastly refusing
to attribute any significance to their presence at the founding of the Babi/
Baha’i religions.

Slavery in Iran
Historians have written little about the history of slavery in Iran. Thomas Ricks
noted this absence as a “perplexing void” in Iranian historiography. He points out
the paucity of scholarship on “the subject of slaves, slave trade, trade routes, col-
lection stations, creditors, or slavery for the medieval, early modern, or modern
periods of Iranian history.”1 Nonetheless, by the nineteenth century, the importa-
tion of slaves into Iranian cities was a long-established practice. Behnaz Mirzai
concluded that reports in the mid-nineteenth century indicated that the majority
of slaves taken from the East African coast were brought into Iranian ports.2

Domestic slavery had existed in Iran since medieval times.3 It was the social
norm in Iran by the nineteenth century, at least in the royal court and the courts
of provincial governors, for wealthy families, and even within the households of
middle-class merchants. Since for an urban, Iranian family of wealth and status
during this period, the seclusion of the women of the household (or at least the
pretense of such seclusion) was a social necessity,4 domestic slaves or “household
servants” were needed to carry out the public business of the house in streets and
markets, and to maintain the honor of the family. Respectable Muslim women
were expected to remain within the private sections of their houses and gardens
and to venture out only when strictly veiled. Women of this class were, at least
officially, expected to have no contact with men who were not their husbands or
immediate relatives, such as fathers, brothers, or sons. Their slaves might haggle
in the bazaar or move about the town without a specific destination, but such
things were off-limits to high-caste, respectable women.

Historically, some slaves in Iran had served as laborers for public works
projects and others were conscripted into the military. However, by the mid-
nineteenth century, African slaves were almost always destined for domestic
service and concubinage. The importation of slaves to Iran for such domestic
purposes continued into the twentieth century. In 1905, for example, Jamila
Khanum, an Ethiopian slave in Shiraz, wrote a letter summarizing her life as a
slave. She wrote:

> My name is Jamila Habashí,5 my father is Lulá’d-Dín from Sáho, my

A distinction in desirability and price was made between “Ethiopian” slaves
(habashi), and East African slaves (siddi, zanji) from farther South on the African
coast. Lady Sheil, a nineteenth-century traveler to Iran, noted that African slaves
were divided into three types: “Bambassees, Nubees, and Habeshees. The former
come from Zanzibar, and the neighboring country in the interior but I don’t know
the etymology of the name [certainly from “Mombasa”]. The others as their
names imply are natives of Nubia [Sudan] and Abyssinia [Ethiopia].”7 Iranians
considered Abyssinians superior to the others, and males were, therefore, more
likely to receive full educations and to be placed in positions of responsibility
and family trust.8 They could be given important jobs within the household,
even acting as their masters’ confidential stewards.9 Due to the mutual depen-
dence between master and slave, and because of slaves’ lack of kinship ties to
rival families, it often happened that a slave would become the person in the
household most trusted by the master. A slave’s loyalty was unlikely to be com-
promised by other considerations. Vanessa Martin observes that: “The master’s
authority over the life of the slave, and its legal security, meant that the master
could train a gifted slave from childhood and use him in the loyal management of
his affairs.”10 This might be especially true if the master had no sons, or perhaps
only one or two.

It was also common for male slaves from Africa—both “Ethiopian” and other-
wise—to be castrated as children before being exported to the Middle East. If the
child survived the operation, he would fetch a much higher price on the market
as a eunuch.11 Such slaves were bought specifically to act as attendants to the
women of wealthy households. Of course, their mutilation insured that their close
association with the women in the private quarters of such households would be
beyond reproach.12 A eunuch could sometimes become his master’s confidant,
as well.13

Polak stated in 1865 that the majority of black slaves (ghulams, kanízes) living
in Iran were born in Africa.14 In 1868, a census in Tehran found that 12 percent of
the civilians living in the city were African slaves or “household servants.”15 The
residents of the city numbered about 100,000. This count of Africans includes
only urban households, and not enslaved Africans who were used to do agricul-
tural work or to maintain the irrigation system.16 This census reveals the extent
of domestic slavery in nineteenth-century Iran and the importance of the African
population in Iranian cities, which is invariably ignored in Iranian history.17

A 12 percent segment of the urban population suggests that there have been
enormous African influences on all aspects of Iranian culture, from food to
music to language to religion. This represents roughly the percentage of African

20                           UCLA HISTORICAL JOURNAL                      Vol. 26 No. 1

Americans to be found living in the United States today, and of course the study
of black people and their influence on American history and culture is a major
field of academic study. Clearly, the study of the African presence in Iran could
be a major field of Iranian studies, as well. 18 As in the American South, the influ-
ence that African slaves had on the history and culture of upper-class and wealthy
Persian families should be especially significant. After all, enslaved servants
maintained close contacts with their masters. As such, we should expect to find
African influences on elite Iranian culture in areas such as elite cuisine, language,
musical tastes, religious practices, and so forth.

Edward Alpers has also called attention to the absence of scholarship on the
African Diaspora in the Indian Ocean and on African cultural influences on soci-
eties from the Arabian Peninsula to India, including Iran.19 In 1997, he called
forcefully for the study of Africans in the northwestern Indian Ocean. He sug-
gested that African cultural influences in this area could become a field of study.
The consensus of all histories of Iran today has until recently, and quite inex-
plicably, insisted on “the all but complete disappearance of a black Diaspora
in Persia.”20 The significance of a large population of African slaves living in
Iran in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries has simply been erased from
contemporary histories.

A recent book by Vanessa Martin on Qajar Iran is a notable exception, since
she devotes two chapters to black slavery in the nineteenth century.21 We might
hope that Martin’s treatment indicates a new interest among academic historians
in African influences on Iranian history. Yet Martin’s general discussion treats
slavery as a legal category, dealing with the slaves themselves as objects and
commodities,22 ignoring slaves as individuals and actors, and seldom (if ever)
asking about African cultural influences on Iranian history.23 In this sense, the
presence of Africans in Iran in the nineteenth century is acknowledged, but their
significance as African actors in Iran’s history is erased. The book provides little
insight into the lives of ordinary slaves in Iran.

Such treatment of the African presence in Iran is the norm. But some
researchers have begun to take a new direction. The Eleventh Biennial Iranian
Studies Conference of the International Society for Iranian Studies (ISIS) will
be held in 2016, at the University of Vienna, on the theme of “African Slavery
in Qajar Iran.” Pedram Khosronejad, an anthropologist at the University of St.
Andrews, U.K., has curated a photo exhibition entitled “African Slavery in
Iran, 1830-1930” at the Association Mémoire de l’Outre-mer in Nantes, France
(2015).24 The German-born, Iranian artist Mahdi Ehsaei has recently published a
photo essay, entitled “Afro-Iran: The Unknown Minority.” These are his images
of Iranians of African descent in the province of Hormozgan, on the Persian Gulf,
who are the descendents of slaves.25

Slavery and Social Death
Orlando Patterson, in his broad comparative study of slavery around the world
defines the condition of slaves in relationship to their societies as a kind of
social death. Slaves in all places, and in all periods of history, were considered
to be persons without rights and without moral claims on the wider community.
Patterson suggests:

> Perhaps the most distinctive attribute of the slave’s powerlessness was
> that it always originated (or was conceived of as having originated) as a
> substitute for death, usually violent death … Archetypically, slavery was a
> substitute for death in war. But almost as frequently, the death commuted
> was punishment for some capital offense, or death from exposure or star-
> vation. . . Because the slave had no socially recognized existence outside
> of his master, he became a social nonperson.26

The only human relationship that slaves had that was socially recognized or
legally sanctioned was their relationship to the master. As such, the enslaved
person was stripped of all claims of birth and belonged (of his or her own right)
to no social order. Patterson argues that this “social death” included the slaves’
alienation from all kinship ties in the present and their alienation from all relation-
ship to ancestors and to any role in history. As far as the society was concerned,
they were social and legal non-persons.27

Until recently, even the academic literature on slavery has been influenced by
this idea. Histories usually make reference to slaves as a class or a group, even as
a gang in rebellion. But as non-persons, individual slaves were most often erased
from historic memory. They could be remembered as objects, but not as indepen-
dent actors in history. Slaves have been excluded from history, just as they were
excluded from society. An individual slave might be praised for his loyalty, even
his bravery, but his life could have no significance beyond devotion to his master.
For the most part, this remains the state of even the academic literature today.

African Presence at the Genesis of the Babi/Baha’i Religion
From its earliest beginnings, the Baha’i faith knew an African dimension and
included African converts. The initial moment of Baha’i history is, interestingly
enough, fixed by scripture at precisely two hours and eleven minutes after sunset
on the evening of 23 May 1844,28 in the city of Shiraz. On that day, Sayyid
‘Alí-Muhammad Shírází—who would later be known as the Bab (Arabic:
gate)—invited a young theology student named Mullá Husayn into his home
and convinced him during the course of that evening that he was the person
who would soon fulfill certain prophecies and expectations of the Shi’i esoteric
tradition.29 This conversation led eventually to the Babi movement, to the impris-
onment and execution of the Bab himself, and to the subsequent appearance of
the Baha’i religion a couple of decades later.30

22                           UCLA HISTORICAL JOURNAL                     Vol. 26 No. 1

Even Nabíl-i A’zam’s hagiographic account of Mullá Husayn’s conversion
mentions an African man who was present on the first night of the Bab’s “dec-
laration.”31 This man, who was invariably referred to in Baha’i sources only as
the Bab’s (unnamed) “Ethiopian servant” attended to his master and guest that
evening.32

The fact that the Bab owned slaves is not surprising. He belonged to a fairly
wealthy merchant family doing business in Shiraz. There seems to be no reason
to suppose that the percentage of the black population of that city would be
any less than that described earlier for the city of Tehran in 1868. Indeed, since
Shiraz is closer to the Persian Gulf slave routes, and since in the 1840s there
was less international anti-slavery activity than there was in the 1860s, the
population of African slaves would, in all probability, be even larger there.
Mirzai notes that Afro-Iranian communities were established in the towns and
cities all along the southern coast of Iran.33 A report in 1847 shows that 3,488
slaves were brought yearly to the Persian Gulf and most of those were destined
for Iran.34 Shiraz was one of the principal cities in the south where slaves were
disembarked for sale or transfer and so the African population there must have
been significant.35

It is impossible to overestimate the significance of the event of the Bab’s “dec-
laration” in 1844, for the Baha’i community. It is regarded as the founding event
of Baha’i history and the beginning of a new age of human development on the
planet.36 The exact moment of the declaration on the night of May 23,37 was
fixed by the Bab himself. The anniversary of this date is observed every year
as a Baha’i holy day in every Baha’i community in the world. Usually, relevant
passages from Nabil’s narrative are read that recall, hour by hour, the events of
that night.38 The story of Mullá Husayn’s conversion is intimately known to all
observant Baha’is. I have argued elsewhere that there is no American Baha’i, for
example, for whom Nabíl’s account does not carry profound personal signifi-
cance. In fact, I have suggested that this story has become one of the foundational
myths supporting American Baha’i identity, an episode that is replayed annually,
at the holy day, in American Baha’i imagination.39

The role of an African slave in these events is not remembered, however.

Nabíl’s account mentions the Bab’s “Ethiopian servant.” But he ascribes no sig-
nificance to his witness to the first day of the revelation. Baha’is celebrate Mullá
Husayn as the Bab’s first believer,40 but they ignore the African presence on
this occasion. At best, they see the presence of an African servant in the Bab’s
household as only an extension of the Prophet’s own charisma and hospitality.

\[41\] Nonetheless, as will be seen, that African presence was important, visible,
and profound.

Haji Mubarak
According to Afnan, the “Ethiopian servant,” Haji Mubarak, was purchased at
the age of 19 by the Bab in 1842 (two years before the beginning of his religious

mission)42 from Haji Mirza Abu’l-Qasim, a brother of the Bab’s wife, Khadijih
Bagum. He had been transported from East Africa as a young child, bought from
slave traders when he was five years old, and trained for business and domestic
service in the household of the Bab’s future brother-in-law. His education is said
to have been “exemplary.”43 All sources are silent on this issue, but because of the
nature of Mubarak’s service in the household of the Bab, and later in Karbala as
the attendant of the women of the household, it is likely that he was a eunuch. He
was literate and skilled at commerce, and the Bab entrusted him with the task of
settling his outstanding accounts and winding up his business affairs in Shiraz.44
This suggests that Mubarak was literate in the language and mathematics of the
traditional accounting system (síyáq).

Although the significance of his African origins is ignored in the account,
Nabíl’s narrative records that Mubarak acted as the doorman at the Bab’s house
on the evening of Mullá Husayn’s conversion. As such, he greeted both master
and guest as they arrived at the house.45 Beyond this, he attended to the other
needs of the two men while their conversation continued all night in the Bab’s
chambers, as he sought to convince Mullá Husayn of his divine mission and
related his new religious teachings. The mullá’s own recollections of Mubarak’s
service are recorded:

> At the third hour after sunset, my Host ordered the dinner to be served.
> That same Ethiopian servant appeared again and spread before us the
> choicest food. That holy repast refreshed alike my body and soul. In
> the presence of my Host, at that hour, I felt as though I were feeding
> upon the fruits of Paradise. I could not but marvel at the manners and
> the devoted attentions of that Ethiopian servant whose very life seemed
> to have been transformed by the regenerating influence of his Master. I
> then, for the first time, recognized the significance of this well-known
> traditional utterance ascribed to Muhammad: “I have prepared for the
> godly and righteous among My servants what eye hath seen not, ear heard
> not, nor human heart conceived.” Had my youthful Host no other claim
> to greatness, this were sufficient—that He received me with that quality
> of hospitality and loving-kindness which I was convinced no other human
> being could possibly reveal.46

After this passage, Mubarak disappears from Nabíl’s narrative of the events of
May 23, 1844. Nabil goes on to proclaim this evening as the beginning of a new
era in human history and to canonize Mulla Husayn as the first believer, never
mentioning Mubarak again.

We are fortunate, however, that nineteenth-century accounts are not the only
sources of information about these events or about the African domestic slaves
that lived in the Bab’s household. We also have the records, the oral traditions,
and the personal reminiscences of the Bab’s family. Not only did various kinsmen
of the Bab eventually become Baha’is (while others remained indifferent, or

24                            UCLA HISTORICAL JOURNAL                          Vol. 26 No. 1

even openly hostile to the Bab’s new faith and the subsequent innovations that
transformed it into the Baha’i religion), but the family was also wealthy and
prominent in other ways, developing a mercantile empire that stretched from
Istanbul to Hong Kong.47

Although the Bab himself had no children, the descendants of his maternal
uncles and of his brother-in-law claimed him as an ancestor. The Baha’i branch
of the family, at least, was known as the Afnans (twigs48), which eventually
transformed from an honorific title into a family surname. The Afnan family has
maintained a keen sense of its own place in history, and particularly in the history
of the Baha’i religion. By the 1980s, one member of the family, Abu’l-Qasim
Afnan, living in England, had come to be regarded as “the true custodian in this
age of the traditions of the Afnan family.”49 Mr. Afnan wrote down the family tra-
ditions as they related to the African slaves in the Bab’s household, in a narrative
that included his own personal reminiscences, specifically for the edification of
Baha’i communities in East and Central Africa. Of course, he had at his disposal
the considerable resources of the Afnan library, held in private archives, which
include documents and memoirs reaching back to the time of the Bab himself.
His account was circulated in mimeographed form for some years. It was even-
tually published in 1988, in the United States, under the title of Black Pearls:
Servants in the Households of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh.50 The book became the
subject of considerable controversy within the American Baha’i community at
the time.51 Nonetheless, Black Pearls may be regarded as a primary source that
embodies a small portion of the Afnan family’s extensive memory and archive of
the events of Baha’i history. 52

It is no surprise that, although it is supposed to be an account of African slaves
in the Bab’s household, Black Pearls focuses a great deal of attention on the Bab
himself as the source of the numinous. The slaves are praised repeatedly for their
loyalty and selflessness, and for their unquestioning—even childlike—devotion
and obedience to “their” family. So, while the presence of these African slaves is
acknowledged, their significance to history is immediately erased. As such, the
book repeats the approach found in earlier Baha’i histories, except that Afnan is
quite personally attached to his relatives’ reminiscences. For example, he writes:

> I vividly remember that my grandmother, the daughter of Hájí Mírzá
> Abú’l-Qásim, would often recall Mubárak’s extreme modesty and polite-
> ness. She would say that, while intelligent, quick of understanding, and
> possessing a great capacity to learn, he nonetheless displayed the utmost
> meekness and humility and showed kindness to all. She would describe
> his manners and demeanor as being regal, and would remark that they
> well befitted his service in the holy house [i.e., the house of the Báb].
> More than anything else, though, she remembered him as a loyal and
> faithful servant of the Báb and His mother.53

But, as I have argued elsewhere,54 Afnan also provides us with enough addi-
tional information to suggest that the event of the “Declaration of the Báb”
should be reinterpreted to include an African presence at the genesis of the Babi
movement.55

Afnan is able to locate Mubarak’s room in the house of the Bab, and even
provides a photograph of the room in his book.56 He informs us that it sits adja-
cent to the room in which the Bab received Mullá Husayn on the night of the
declaration. Since it would have been unthinkable for a domestic slave to retire
for the evening while his master remained awake, entertaining a houseguest,
Mubarak “waited sleepless and vigilant, just outside the chamber, ready to serve
when called upon.”57 This account does not make much of the obvious fact that
Mubarak was present—and perhaps not even out of sight—throughout the con-
versation that lead to Mullá Husayn’s conversion, that he clearly witnessed the
entire event, that he must have been fully aware of the religious claims that his

Mubarak’s Room in the House of the Báb
In Shiraz, Iran. According to Abu’l-Qasim Afnan, the room is adjacent to the audience room where the Bab
received Mullá Husayn in the small house on the evening of May 23, 1844. The events of that night resulted
in Mullá Husayn’s conversion and the beginning of the Babi movement. The house of the Bab was completely
renovated in the 1870s, so the room would not have looked exactly like this at the time the Bab lived in the house.

This house became a place of pilgrimage almost immediately after the Bab’s execution in 1850. Here the
Bab’s wife received Babi, and later Baha’i, pilgrims who came to pay their respects to the widow and visit the
birthplace of the religion. The house remained a place of pilgrimage for Baha’is all over the world through the
1970s. After the Islamic Revolution in Iran (1979), it was razed to the ground by government officials because it
was a center of Baha’i activity.

master was making, and that—since he was Muslim, literate and educated—
the significance of these claims could not have been lost on him. While Mullá
Husayn is understood by Baha’is to be the Bab’s first convert, Mubarak was
present at the time of his conversion and may have shared his experience. This
possibility is not celebrated in Baha’i imagination, however.

Beyond this, Afnan makes reference to the traditional sources that document
Mubarak’s intimate association with his master during the whole period of the
Bab’s early activities. Between May 1844 and September 1846—when the Bab
was finally arrested for his religious heresies and forced to leave Shiraz for the
last time, Mubarak met and served all of the first disciples of the movement: he
carried secret verbal messages and written correspondence between his master
and these disciples; he was the Bab’s companion and attendant (along with
one other disciple) on the pilgrimage in 1844-1845, to Mecca, where the new
Prophet publicly announced his claim to be the Qa’im. Mubarak was witness to
the Bab’s nearly continuous dictation of sermons and religious treatises during
the pilgrimage; he was shocked when most of these writings were stolen and
was willing to defend them and attempt to retrieve them at the risk of his life. He
was present when his master was detained in June 1845 and placed under house
arrest in Shiraz. During the period of that confinement, he served his master and
was in charge of surreptitiously (and in defiance of government orders) bringing
followers to meet with him through a secret passage to the house. When the Bab
finally left Shiraz for hiding in Isfahan, Mubarak never saw him again but was
entrusted with the care of his wife and mother, both of whom remained at home.58

Fezzeh Khanum59
Mubarak was not the only slave in the Bab’s household. Afnan also introduces
us to Fezzeh Khanum, an African woman who was the servant and companion of
the Bab’s wife, Khadíjih Bagum. When the Bab married in 1842, he established a
new household which consisted of two slaves, his wife, his mother, and himself.
Of the family of five, two were Africans; and after the Bab’s forced departure,
half the household was African.

The Bab had purchased Mubarak from his wife’s brother for 14 tumans (about
$28.00), and he was probably more of a wedding present from the brother-in-law
than anything else.60 At the time of his marriage, the Bab also “acquired” (to use
Afnan’s term) a servant for his wife, Fezzeh Khanum, an “Ethiopian” child who
was probably no more than seven years old and clearly did not represent a great
investment of funds. They all lived in a small two-story house in Shiraz and the
family seems to have had modest means. The Bab had some time earlier retired
from his business activities to pursue religious studies and devotions. It is not
clear that he had any income at all, at this point, and may have relied on relatives
for support.61

Afnan’s portrayal of Fezzeh’s life presents, if possible, an even more ideal
picture of a selfless servant utterly lost in devotion to her mistress than does his

portrayal of Mubarak. After the Bab’s mother departed with Mubarak to Iraq,
Afnan assures us that: “ . . . Fezzeh was able to dedicate herself fully to Khadíjih
Bagum to the exception of all others in her life. She never developed any warm
friendship with anyone else, even though there were a number of servants in
the homes of the uncles of the Báb. Never would she appear in public except
in attendance on Khadíjih Bagum.”62 Beyond this, Afnan insists that: “Fezzeh
Khanum refused to even contemplate life without Khadíjih Bagum.”63 In fact,
both women actually died on the same night, November 15, 1881. Fezzeh was
about 47 years old. Afnan explains that Khadíjih Bagum died first, and that a
short time later “. . . true to her heart’s desire, the spirit of Fezzeh winged its
flight to join her beloved mistress.”64 The narrative is so idyllic on this point
that one would assume that Fezzeh had either died of acute grief or had com-
mitted suicide. Afnan assured me personally however, upon my inquiry, that both
women had simply succumbed to dysentery, one after the other.65

As Armstrong-Ingram remarks in his discussion of Fezzeh’s life, one is
tempted by Afnan’s account “to consider her a child so traumatized by the experi-
ence of enslavement that she attached herself totally to a ‘protector’ and grew up
to be a withdrawn, asocial person.”66 However, there are aspects of her story in
this and in other histories that suggest otherwise. Some time after her husband’s
execution, Khadíjih Bagum’s home became a center of pilgrimage for the perse-
cuted Babis (and later Baha’is) of Iran.67 Streams of visitors came to the house to
seek out the presence of the wife of the Bab, who was regarded as a holy person
in her own right by virtue of her direct relationship to the Prophet. Some of the
women, at least, might remain as houseguests for extended periods. Khadijih
Bagum would receive these visitors, act as guide to the holy house, and recount
her memories of her husband and her marriage to her devoted listeners. In this
role, she became a person of considerable influence within the Baha’i commu-
nity. Fezzeh, for her part, remained the only servant in the house and would wait
on and cook for the guests—so social isolation was not an option.

In addition, Fezzeh Khanum—having known the Bab and lived in his house-
hold—also inherited some of the Prophet’s charisma. Abu’l-Qasim Afnan
explained to me that she was also an object of reverence and devotion for visiting
pilgrims. He made a point of saying that these visitors would kiss the shoulder68
of Fezzeh as an act of subordination and reverence and that they regarded her
spiritual station as above their own.69 I would suggest that these acts of venera-
tion for an African slave woman can hardly be regarded by historians of Iranian
history as devoid of significance, both cultural and religious. Yet I can only
cite them here as a result of my brief encounter with the oral traditions of the
Afnan family. Veneration of Fezzeh Khanum is never mentioned in any book of
Baha’i history.

Presence and Erasure
Despite their close relationship to the Bab and their acknowledged participation
in some of the most critical early events of his ministry, neither Mubarak nor
Fezzeh are given much notice in traditional Baha’i histories, and even less in
academic discussions of Babi/Baha’i history. Afnan himself rejected the idea
that they should even be regarded as Babis. He is careful in his book to charac-
terize their service to the Bab as demonstrating only their devotion to his person
and as having no religious significance—either for present-day Baha’is or for
the individuals themselves. He repeatedly denied that such devotion should be
interpreted in such as way as to grant a Babi identity to either Haji Mubarak or
Fezzeh Khanum. Indeed, none of the early sources ever make reference to them
as “Bábis.”

However, the sources never make reference to anyone as a “Bábi.” Especially
during the early years of the Bab’s mission, the nature of Babi identity was
extremely fluid and undefined and even the word itself had not yet been coined.
The religious identity of the early followers of the Bab is simply inferred from
their behavior and their identification with, their loyalty and devotion to, the Bab
as the source of the numinous. Perhaps because of their status as slaves, different
rules seem to be applied for Mubarak and Fezzeh. From the perspective of the
sources, it could be that their slave status simply disqualified them from the
possibility of having a Babi identity. Or, perhaps, it was assumed that, as slaves,
they were not free agents and could not, therefore, choose to change religions or
dedicate themselves to the person of the Bab as a matter of their own personal
decision. Still, it is curious that an author like Afnan would spend so much time
praising the selfless and unfailing devotion of both of the servants he memorial-
izes if he felt that such devotion were coerced.

The publisher of Afnan’s Black Pearls: Servants in the Households of the Báb
and Bahá’u’lláh intended to bring the book out under the title of “Black Bábís,”
with the same subtitle.70 The book was even initially advertised as forthcoming
with the “Black Bábís” title. However, the author flatly refused to allow this title
to be used for his book. An exchange of letters followed in which the publisher
argued that all of the persons written about in the book should be regarded as
Babis based on their actions, their devotion to the Bab, and their participation in
seminal events of Babi history. Afnan was not convinced, however. He wrote:

> . . . there is no evidence which indicates that any of the black servants
> mentioned in my book except Masoud71 became believers in the Bab
> or Bahá’u’lláh. . . . We have to bear in mind that simply the fact of the
> presence of these servants at certain important historical occasions is not
> sufficient as evidence of belief or proof of declaration.72 . . . Therefore,
> not having seen or heard any evidence of a declaration of faith by any of
> these black servants, I am reluctant to state categorically that they became
> believers.”73

Again:

> . . . these black servants were not declared Bábis except Masud, but they
> were dedicated and faithful, selfless, truthful and loving followers of the
> Bab and Bahá’u’lláh and their family and followers.74

Of Fezzeh, Afnan states directly in his book, “[S]he was not aware of the sta-
tion and mission of the Báb.”75 Of course, in the case of the Bab’s manservant,
such a statement would have been absolutely unsupportable, and we find no
similar remark in Afnan’s chapter on Mubarak. Moreover, I would suggest that
the notion that Fezzeh could have remained unaware of the claims of the Bab
throughout her lifetime beggars all reason, though this view was obviously held
concerning her within the Afnan family. This same conclusion with regard to
Babi identity also represents the consensus within the Baha’i community with
regard to both servants. Their presence is acknowledged; their significance is
erased. In any case, the title “Black Bábís” was changed to Black Pearls at the
author’s insistence.

Why Afnan should maintain such views is an open question. Armstrong-
Ingram suggests that he simply “projected [back] a bureaucratic view of religious
identity that became common in the Baha’i community around the 1930s on his
subjects.”76 I think it more likely that he unconsciously reproduced the views
long held within his family—views that were primarily determined by cultural
attitudes towards Africans, slaves, and household servants. A slave, after all,
is a non-person, socially dead in Patterson’s terms. A slave, almost by defini-
tion, cannot be an independent actor. Rather, a slave is supposed to be a person
attached by law and by custom to the identity of another individual, who is the
master. A slave might be a good servant or a bad one, might be devoted and
faithful, or careless and perfidious, might be truthful or false. But, the idea of a
slave making a free and independent decision to assume a new religious identity
is almost a contradiction in terms.77 Nonetheless, as I have suggested above, it is
certainly time to reconsider such false assumptions.

One aspect of Afnan’s book that most startled his American readers was the
assertion that neither Haji Mubarak nor Fezzeh Khanum were told by the Bab’s
family about the Prophet’s execution as a heretic by clergy and government in
Tabriz (northern Iran) in 1850. The Bab had been imprisoned for years before his
execution, and the Babi movement had created a political and social upheaval in
Iran. Armed conflicts broke out in various parts of the country, clerics regularly
vilified Babis from the pulpit, and the Bab was the subject of general rumor in all
parts of Iran. Nonetheless, the final blow came as a shock to the Bab’s relatives.
Afnan admits that the menfolk tried to keep the news from the women in the
family for as long as they could.78

Of Mubarak, Afnan wrote:

Of Fezzeh Khanum, Afnan simply wrote, “[S]he was so enchanted by Him
[the Báb] that she could not even fathom the thought that He could have been
killed under such brutal circumstance.”80 In 1877, some 27 years after the execu-
tion, the house of the Bab in Shiraz was renovated by Baha’is so that Khadíjih
Bagum could live there once again. Afnan relates a family tradition about this
to illustrate the point that Fezzeh remained ignorant of the Bab’s death until the
end of her life. He said that Fezzeh was found rejoicing at the work being done,
since she believed that the renovations meant that her master would soon return
from his long journey to India. Afnan remarked, “Her joy was a heartbreaking
testimony to her devotion.”81

As persecutions of the Babi religion intensified in Iran, both during the Bab’s
lifetime and after his execution,82 the situation of Khadíjih Bagum and the other
members of her family in Shiraz became precarious, and even dangerous. For
a time it was unsafe for the Bab’s wife to remain in her house, and she took up
residence with relatives. Under such circumstances, it became expedient for the
family to maintain the public fiction that it was not their relative who had been
executed. Rather, the story was released that Sayyid ‘Ali-Muhammad had trav-
eled to India to take charge of an arm of the Afnan trade network there. He was
on an extended journey, but he would eventually return.

Such a story may have made it a little easier for the Afnans to maintain face in
public, but it certainly convinced no one. Naturally, the family’s loyal household
slaves were willing and able to defend the public fiction for decades.83 But the
Bab’s mother and grandmother eventually felt compelled to move their residence
from Shiraz to Karbala, in Iraq, to escape from the rumors and deprecations of
their Muslim relatives who made no secret of their contempt and hostility.84

It is certainly absurd to maintain that either Haji Mubarak or Fezzeh Khanum
remained literally unaware of the fate of their master, since they regularly
attended to household duties in the streets of the city and would have heard all the
news that circulated there. Both servants witnessed the Bab’s arrest, his imprison-
ment at home, and his forced departure. They certainly overheard conversations
within the household and witnessed the mourning of the family’s grief-stricken
women when the news of the Bab’s execution was finally confirmed for them.
Afnan maintains that the mother of the Bab, for example, was “beside herself
with grief.”85 Beyond that, there was the parade of Babi and Baha’i pilgrims that
Fezzeh Khanum witnessed and attended to for some thirty years after the Bab’s
death. It is not reasonable to suppose that the significance of any of these events
would have been lost on anyone. Nonetheless, that is what Afnan asserts with
regard to the Bab’s slaves, and so that is the current state of Baha’i literature.86

So, the African dimension of the genesis of the Babi religion remains unex-
plored both by the Baha’i faith community and by the academic community.
And it is not possible for me to explore it here, since such matters are beyond the
scope of this work. However, the subject cries out for further study. At this point,
it can only be said emphatically that there was an important African presence
at the events that marked the germination of the Babi movement. During those
early years, the Bab and his family lived in intimate association with Africans
who were members of their household. We should expect then that a search for
African cultural influences would prove fruitful. At this time, both Baha’i history
and Iranian history seem unfamiliar with—perhaps hostile to—the concept that
slaves might influence the tastes, the language, the actions, and even the ideas
of their masters. However, the academic study of the African Diaspora in the
Americas and in other parts of the world has demonstrated this truth beyond a
reasonable doubt.

Recovering the History of African Slaves in Iran
The results of our inquiry into the beginnings of the Babi Movement are per-
haps surprising. Following up the hint of an “Ethiopian servant” in the house of
the Bab found in traditional Baha’i sources, we discover an important African
presence at the genesis of the religion. Indeed, half of the Bab’s household was
African after his arrest and exile in 1846. Thus, this paper illustrates the value of
family traditions and oral sources for the recovery of subaltern histories in Iran.
In this case, they allow scholars to recover at least partial biographies of two
ordinary, nineteenth-century slaves in Iran—biographies that we had assumed
were lost to history. These two people were acknowledged as present on impor-
tant occasions in the sources and then erased from historical memory and made
into non-persons. Yet, their stories can be recovered.

I suggest that the same process of discovery that we see on a micro-level
within the history of the Babi/Baha’i religions can be applied on a macro-level
to the history of Iran as a whole. Hints in the sources that demonstrate an African

32                                 UCLA HISTORICAL JOURNAL                                Vol. 26 No. 1

presence in the royal household, and in Iranian society in general. need to be
taken seriously, followed, and developed into research projects. The presence of
Afro-Iranian communities in Iranian cities should be rediscovered. Family tradi-
tions and oral sources may yield surprising information. The lives of ordinary
persons who were enslaved in Iran must be taken seriously. Historians need to
deconstruct the ways in which these African people have been acknowledged and
then erased from Iranian history.

In the preface to the 2005 paperback edition of his book Resurrection and
Renewal, Abbas Amanat suggests that anti-Baha’i attitudes in Iran, even among
the secular enemies of the present Islamic regime, are rooted in a deep resent-
ment of “the presence in Iran of an ‘Other’ that does not conform to the imagined
Iranian Self.” He suggests, perhaps wrongly, that this desire for a pure and
unblemished national selfhood “runs deep in Iranian consciousness, a disease fed
by the purity fetishism of the Shi’ite creed . . .”87 That is, a need for purity deeply
rooted in religion. The Baha’i community is that “Other,” and so must be erased
and dismissed, even by the non-religious. However, it may not be only Babis and
Baha’is who threaten the unitary vision of the Iranian Self, but also black slaves
pursuing their own African cultures on Iranian soil who have also been erased
from history. Such a possibility has not yet been contemplated by academic his-
torians. But if we are willing to follow the leads that are right before our eyes, we
may be surprised by our own discoveries.

4 This was indeed often more a matter of pretense as anything else. Lady Sheil noted, with regard

to Tehran in the early 1850s: “[Women of] all classes enjoy abundance of liberty, more so, I think,
than among us. The complete envelopment of the face and person [the veil, or chadur] disguises them
effectually from the nearest relatives, and destroying, when convenient, all distinction of rank, gives
unrestrained freedom. The bazars [sic] are crowded with women in this most ungraceful disguise.
The weekly bath and constant visits consume a large share of their time; and Thursday afternoon is
devoted to a mock pilgrimage to some shrine outside the town, or else to the grave of some relation.”

in northern Ethiopia,” and that Omrānīah presumably refers to the Oromo. The latter supposition is
certainly not true because linguistic barriers would prevent such a shift in pronunciation (Christopher

15 Still, I am highly suspicious of the census category “household servants” in this context. The

Iranian government formally outlawed the slave trade in 1848, but the importation of slaves from
Africa continued. Under such circumstances, it may have been prudent for the wealthy to refer to their
African slaves as “household servants,” especially in official matters like censuses.

18 The current state of Iranian scholarship with regard to African influences on the history, language,

dance, folklore, music, and religion of Iran (among other aspects of the culture) resembles the state of
American scholarship some sixty years ago, with regard to African influences on American culture.
It was supposed then that there were none—that the experience of slavery had erased all cultural
memory from the minds of slaves, who arrived in the New World as tabulae rasa. (At least the
presence of an African diaspora was never denied.) The opening salvo of the destruction of such a
position was Melville J. Herskowitz’s, The Myth of the Negro Past (Boston: Beacon Press, 1941)
which documented the survival of African culture in the Americas and its influence on American
societies. Eugene Genovese’s Roll, Jordan, Roll (New York: Random House, 1972) was a major
contribution to the study of African American slave culture. Since then, of course, although African
American history remains a subaltern field in academia, the influence of African people on the United
States has become an important field of study.

an Old Problem, New Directions in Research,” Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the
Middle East (formerly South Asia Bulletin) Vol. 17 (1997) no. 2, pp. 62-81. Even Alpers’s article—
while calling on evidence and examples from Arabia and India without difficulty—was unable to
discuss Iran as the site of African cultural influence, however. Presumably, this is because so little has
been written on the subject.

20 Segal, Islam’s Black Slaves, 127.

21 Martin, The Qajar Pact, pp. 150-82. Chapter 8 is entitled “Slavery and Black Slaves in Iran in

the Nineteenth Century.” Chapter 9 is “Slaves II: Haji Bashir Khan—Love in a Complicated Climate.”

22 Slaves certainly were objects and commodities by reason of their legal status and their market

value and I do not fault Martin for recognizing that. Nor do I think that such assessments should be
avoided. However, slaves were also human beings, and it is important not to loose sight of that. As
such, they are actors in history. Historians must strive to recognize that agency when writing history.

23 Martin does note, almost in passing, that the African slaves of Bushir would regularly gather near

the main gate of the city to play African music, beat drums, sing songs, and dance. The ulama objected
to these mixed-gender music sessions, but they continued despite attempts to stop them (Martin, The
Qajar Pact, 157). The significance of these gatherings as a site for the reproduction of Afro-Iranian
culture, the fact that such sessions would indicate strong social networks among African slaves in
Bushir, the hints that indicate there must have been other sites of African cultural expression in the
city, the ability of the slaves to defy the ulama by whatever means, the position of Africans as singers
and dancers within Iranian society—all such issues are simply not pursued.

Greece, Rome, medieval Europe, China, Africa, the Islamic world, and the American South.

27 Patterson, Slavery and Social Death, 5-6. In recent critiques, Patterson has been misunderstood

as suggesting that enslaved persons may have understood themselves to be “socially dead.” This is
not Patterson’s argument, which is concerned only with the legal and social condition of slaves. He
states directly: “When we say that the slave was natally alienated and ceased to belong independently
to any formally recognized community, this does not mean that he or she did not experience or share
informal social relations. A large number of works have demonstrated that slaves in both ancient and
modern times had strong social ties among themselves. The important point, however, is that these
relationships were never recognized as legitimate or binding.” (Ibid., 6.)

28 That is, the evening of 5 Jamadíyu’l-Avval, 1260 A.H. of the Islamic calendar. This anniversary

was celebrated for many decades on the evening of May 22, on the Western calendar by Baha’is. But
the commemoration has recently been moved to the evening of May 23.

29 At least according to the hagiographic account of the Bab’s “declaration” found in the pious

history of Nabíl-i ‘Azam (Mullá Muhammad Zarandi) edited and translated into English by Shoghi
Effendi as The Dawn-Breakers: Nabíl’s Narrative of the Early Days of the Bahá’í Revelation
(Wilmette, Ill.: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1932). There are other accounts of the event, most notably
in Mirza Husayn Hamadani, The Táríkh-i-Jadíd or New History of Mírzá Alí Muhammad the Báb,
trans. by Edward G. Browne (Cambridge University Press, 1893). For a full discussion of the sources,
see Abbas Amanat, Resurrection and Renewal: The Making of the Babi Movement in Iran, 1844-
1850 (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1989), 166-174. Other accounts, while no less affected
by Baha’i piety than is Nabíl’s narrative, are more interested in chronicling Mullá Husayn’s inner
struggle to accept the Bab’s messianic claim. This struggle almost certainly played itself out over a
period of at least a few days—other sources suggest anywhere between three and forty days—rather
than in one night, as Nabíl relates.

30 In his Persian Bayán (Bayán II, 7 30) the Bab himself fixes the exact moment for the beginning

of his revelation. See Selections from the Writings of the Báb (Haifa: Bahá’í World Center, 1976), 107.
Also, Amanat, Resurrection and Renewal, 170.

31 There is a considerable literature on the Babi movement. The various works of Edward G. Browne

are still important, especially his translation and notation of A Traveller’s Narrative (Cambridge
University Press, 1891 and Los Angeles: Kalimat Press, 2004) and his own Materials for the Study
of the Bábí Religion (Cambridge University Press, 1918). The best recent academic treatments are to
be found in Abbas Amanat, Resurrection and Renewal and in Denis MacEoin, “From Shaykhism to
Babism: A Study in Charismatic Renewal in Shí’í Islam,” Ph.D. diss., Cambridge University, 1979
(published in idem., The Messiah of Shiraz: Studies in Early and Middle Babism (Leiden: Brill, 2009),
3-249). The classic Baha’i chronicle of the period is Nabíl-i A’zam’s The Dawn-Breakers, mentioned
above. See also, H. M. Balyuzi, The Báb: The Herald of the Day of Days (Oxford: George Ronald,
1973) and Peter Smith’s sociological study, The Babi and Bahá’í Religions: From messianic Shi’ism
to a world religion (Cambridge University Press, 1987). The early volumes of the Studies in the Bábí
and Bahá’í Religions series, Author, General Editor (Los Angeles: Kalimát Press, 1982- ) several
essays on Babi history, especially, Vol. 3, In Iran, ed. by Peter Smith (Los Angeles: Kalimát Press,
1986).

32 Nabíl’s narrative is the most well-known and popular history of the early days of the Babi/Baha’i

religion. Since it was translated, edited, and extensively revised by Shoghi Effendi, it also has the aura
of a sacred history within the Baha’i community.

33 Haji Mubarak is also mentioned, though not by name, as being present with the Bab on other

important occasions in early Babi history.

37 Shoghi Effendi Rabbani (head of the Bahá’í religion, 1921-1957, known as the “Guardian of the

Cause of God,” valí amru’lláh) begins his official history of the Babi and Baha’i religions by citing
the Bab’s night of declaration: “May 23, 1844, signalizes the commencement of the most turbulent
period of the Heroic Age of the Bahá’í Era, an age which marks the opening of the most glorious
epoch in the greatest cycle which the spiritual history of mankind has yet witnessed.” (God Passes
By, 3)

38 That is, the evening of 5 Jamadíyu’l-Avval, 1260 A.H. of the Islamic calendar. This anniversary

was celebrated for many decades on the evening of May 22, on the Western calendar by Baha’is. But
the commemoration has recently been moved to the evening of May 23.

41 Mulla Husayn was given the honorific title “Babu’l-Bab” (the gate to the gate) by the Bab

himself. Baha’u’llah, the founder of the Baha’i faith, praises him in hyperbolic terms. “. . . Mulla
Husayn, . . . became the recipient of the effulgent glory of the Sun of divine Revelation. But for him,
God would not have been established upon the seat of His mercy, nor ascended the throne of eternal
glory.” Baha’u’llah, The Kitab-i-Iqan (Wilmette, Ill.: Baha’i Publishing Trust, 1931), 222.

42 I am referring here, not only to the early histories, such as those cited in Note 29, above, but

also to more recent Baha’i literature, for example: Hasan Balyuzi, The Báb: Herald of the Day of
Days (Oxford: George Ronald, 1973); Nader Saiedi, Gate of the Heart: Understanding the Writings
of the Báb. Vol. 1. (Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press, 2008); and Hussein Ahdieh and Hillary Chapman,
Awakening: The Story of the Bábí and Bahá’í Faiths in Nayríz (Wilmette, Ill.: Baha’i Publishing,
2013). All ignore the African presence at the genesis of the Babi religion.

43 According to Afnan, there is a bill of sale that exists that records Mubarak’s age in 1842 at the

time of his purchase by the Bab as 19. (Abu’l-Qasim Afnan, Black Pearls: Servants in the Households
of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh (Los Angeles: Kalimát Press, 1988 [1999]), 5). More recently, Nader
Saiedi has disputed this conclusion, suggesting that Mubarak was much older and had known the
Bab as a child (Nader Saiedi, “Sultan-i Habashi” in Payam-i Baha’i (France) May 2010, 10-13). Dr.
Saiedi has been able to read the entire corpus of the Bab’s writings housed in the International Baha’i
Archives, Haifa, Israel, and bases his conclusions on that research. His article has been translated into
English, Nader Saiedi (trans. and annotated by Omid Ghaemmaghami) “The Ethiopian King,” Baha’i
Studies Review, 17 (2011), 181–86. I draw no conclusions here concerning Mubarak’s age, and the
narrative of Mubarak’s life after entering the Bab’s household is not challenged by Saiedi’s research.
However, it appears that Saiedi’s reading of the Bab’s correspondence and prayers may provide more
information about the life of Haji Mubarak. This, of course, reinforces the conclusion that Baha’i
literature (in this case, scripture) has something to offer to Iranian history and the notion that the
biographies of African slaves can be recovered.

51 Abu’l-Qasim Afnan, Black Pearls. Second Edition, 1999. The book remains in print today and is

no longer the subject of much controversy.

52 Some African American Baha’is were outraged at the revelation that the Central Figures of

their religion had been slave owners. (See, for example, the protest posted at http://www.geocities.
com/Pentagon/3016/racism. htm. Geocities closed in 2009, but can be recovered in archives.) Others
seemed unconcerned about that but felt that a public portrayal of early black believers as slaves—even
if slaves of the founders—was unseemly and ill-considered. They preferred to see black Baha’is in
history occupying more dignified positions. They also objected to Mr. Afnan’s accounts as patron-
izing. In effect, these African American Baha’is were (unwittingly, perhaps) insisting on the erasure of
enslaved Africans from the history of the Baha’i religion.

53 This very important little book also provides biographies of African slaves and servants who

served in the households of Baha’u’llah, and of his son ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in Iran and in Palestine. These
narratives are also of considerable interest, but are beyond the scope of this study.

56 And also a feminine presence, for that matter. The traditions of the Afnan family also include

testimony from the Bab’s wife, who said that she also “witnessed” the events of the Declaration of
the Bab on the evening of May 23, 1844. Apparently, she remained awake the whole night listening to
her husband’s conversation with Mullá Husayn, which could be clearly heard even from the women’s
apartments in the Bab’s modest house. (Munírih Khanum, Munírih Khanúm: Memoirs and Letters
(Los Angeles: Kalimát Press, 1986), 34. Her testimony reinforces the conclusion that Mubarak must
have also overheard this conversation,.

63 Ibid., 22. I should note here that the other servants mentioned here lived in adjoining houses of

the Bab’s relatives. This also indicates the importance of the African presence in these households and
implies that the African servants were naturally close to one another and were expected to relate to one
another with “warm friendship.” Here we can catch a brief glimpse of the slave networks that would
be able to preserve and reproduce some aspects of African culture.

68 The Bab’s house remained an important place of pilgrimage for Baha’is until it was razed to the

ground by Muslim zealots after the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

69 Kissing of hands is forbidden by Baha’i religious law (Baha’u’llah, The Kitáb-i Aqdas, K34).

70 This statement was his response to objections which had been made by some African American

Baha’is that his portrayal of Fezzeh was demeaning to black people. He insisted that Iranian Baha’is
of a previous generation had regarded Fezzeh as a holy person, as did he. I remember quite vividly
that at the end of our visit, perhaps in illustration of his point, Mr. Afnan embraced me and kissed my
shoulder. The effect was indeed startling and inspired me with a sense of humility and deep respect for
the man, who seemed to embody at that moment all of the traditional dignity, modesty, and rectitude
of his illustrious family (Afnan, personal conversation with the author).

71 Kalimát Press was the publisher and I acted as the in-house editor for the book. In fact, Kalimát

Press had proposed the publication of the book to Afnan in the first instance, after seeing the mimeo-
graphed biographies that had been circulated in Africa.

72 A servant of Khál-i Akbar (an uncle of the Bab) who met Baha’u’llah and became a Baha’i.

73 That is, a formal declaration of faith in the Prophet that would change one’s religious identity.

The concept here is similar to the recitation of the shahada, which instantly and unquestionably
changes one’s status to that of a Muslim in Islamic jurisprudence. The present-day Baha’i community
requires a declaration of faith before one is admitted to membership.

the grammar and spelling errors in the original text.

75 Abu’l-Qasim Afnan to Author, June 29, 1988. Kalimát Press archives. I should point out that the

concept of a “declared Babi” is an anachronism that demonstrates the influence of later Baha’i ideas.

76 Afnan, Black Pearls, 23.

77 Armstrong-Ingram, “‘Black Pearls,’” 22. That is, Armstrong-Ingram suggests that since the

Bab’s slaves had never made a formal “declaration” of faith as is required in the contemporary Baha’i
community, they could not be considered Babis.

78 Armstrong-Ingram has also suggested to me, in private conversation, that in some ways the

reputation and honor of the Afnan family might be involved here. After all, most of the Afnans were
not Babis at all, but were converted to the Baha’i religion during the time of Baha’u’llah (ministry,
1863-1892). So, if Mubarak and Fezzeh were accepted as real Babis, they would have preceded
the members of the Afnan family (except for the Bab’s wife) into the Faith by almost a generation.
Personally, I doubt that this was a conscious consideration on Afnan’s part, though it may have uncon-
sciously colored his thinking. The general Iranian attitudes towards slaves, even those for whom one
had affectionate feelings, caused them to be treated as non-persons who could not fully participate
in society.

79 Afnan, Black Pearls, 16-17. This is not an unusual strategy for dealing with the death of an

absent relative within Iranian families. Quite often, the bad news will be kept from as many relatives
as possible for as long as possible. Of course, the charade inevitably comes to an end. The truth is
either revealed openly, accidentally or secretly, and it is then either fully acknowledged or feigned
ignorance is maintained as a polite fiction within the family and by outsiders.

80 Afnan, Black Pearls, 17-18.

81 Ibid., 23. The “brutal circumstances” are a reference to the Bab’s execution by firing squad.

82 Ibid.

83 Persecution became especially intense in 1852, after an attempt was made on the life of the shah

by a group of Babis in Tehran.

84 There may have been an element of self-interest at play here, as well. Mubarak and Fezzeh were,

after all, slaves. If their master were determined to be dead, his property could be divided up among
his heirs. That property might include the two of them and their household would be destroyed. I am
grateful to Mehrdad Amanat for this insight (Personal communication).
