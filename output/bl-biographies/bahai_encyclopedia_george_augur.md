Augur, George Jacob (1853–1927)
American doctor who became one of the early Bahá’ís of Hawaii and was the first
resident Bahá’í in Japan, living there for significant periods from 1914 to 1919;
designated by Shoghi Effendi a Disciple of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

Other Sources and Related Reading               George Augur entered Yale University Medical

College in 1876, graduating in 1879. He was
resident physician and surgeon at the State Hospital in New Haven (now Yale–New Haven Hospital)
between 1879 and 1882. He attended the Fair Haven Congregational Church, where he served as
superintendent. 1

In 1882 Augur moved to Oakland, California. There he opened
an office in downtown Oakland and also served for some fifteen
years as an attending physician on the staff of the East Bay’s
first hospital, the Oakland Homeopathic Hospital and Dispensary,
renamed the Fabiola Hospital in 1887. Organized and managed
by women and including women physicians on its staff, from
1877 until 1932 the hospital provided both conventional
(allopathic) and homeopathic treatments, particularly for the
indigent and the working poor. Augur worked as an allopathic
physician until 1895, when he became a practitioner of
homeopathy—an "'apostasy,'" as it was later described, that
"cost him in preferment and friends." 2

On 16 June 1892 in Oakland, Augur married Ruth Barstow Dyer,
a native Californian (b. 16 January 1864). Their union produced
one child, Morris Curtis Augur, born on 1 March 1894.

Finding that the climate of the Bay Area did not suit him,
George Augur moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, arriving aboard the        George Jacob Augur

SS Australia on 1 February 1898. He opened a medical practice
and was soon joined by his wife and son.

ACTIVITIES AS A BAHÁ’Í IN HAWAII AND JAPAN
In the winter of 1905, Ruth Augur’s sister Alice Otis—who resided in Honolulu with her husband, a
former sea captain—became a Bahá’í and opened her home for Bahá’í meetings. The sisters had
connections with Bahá’ís not only in Honolulu but in Oakland; their family home was a few doors away
from the Jackson Street residence of Helen Goodall, one of the early Bahá’ís of the Bay Area, and
members of the two families moved in the same social circle. Ruth Augur, although content in her
Christian faith, began attending the meetings and in 1907, when her sister was going away, invited the
Bahá’ís to meet in her home on Beretania Street. "From that time in 1907," Agnes Alexander—the first

Bahá’í of Hawaii and a colleague of Augur’s in both Honolulu and Japan—recalls, "the Augur home
became the radiant center of the Cause in Honolulu where the weekly meetings were held and the
Baha’i library kept. Except during the intervals when the Augurs were away from the Island, for many
years the Baha’is met there." 3

explained having become a homeopath—"very gently,
and characteristically regardful of the feelings and perhaps prejudices of one belonging to a different
school."5

For Alexander, Augur was "independent in his convictions and accustomed to standing alone."6 Whereas
Ruth Augur "had a mother heart of love which she showered on everyone," George Augur had a quiet
and reserved disposition: "He was a man of few words, but his love for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and insight into His
station [at a time when many in the West thought of Him as a prophet or even the return of Christ]
gave power to his words."7

Augur received six letters from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The first, dated early in 1909, addressed Augur’s request
for an explanation of Hebrews 4:15: "For we have not an high priest [Jesus, the Son of God] which
cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet
without sin." The second, written in 1913, clarified Augur’s understanding of the stations of Bahá’u’lláh
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. 8 Later letters focused on Augur’s services in Japan.

George Augur’s attraction to that country dated back to a three-month-long holiday there in 1906.
"Refined in his taste, he had great appreciation of Japan," Agnes Alexander relates. "The small garden
at the back of his home in Honolulu, he had designed in the form of a Japanese garden." 9 In 1913
Augur wrote ‘Abdu’l-Bahá of his desire to go to Japan for an "indefinite stay." 10 In November of that
year, Augur received a response: "Arise thou to perform the blessed intention thou art holding and
travel thou to Japan and lay there the foundation of the Cause of God, that is, summon the people to
the Kingdom of God."11

Traveling alone, Augur left for Japan in May 1914. On his arrival in Tokyo in June, he became the first
Bahá’í to take up residence in that country. 12 He began making friends and studying the language.
Soon he received a tablet from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that said in part, "A thousand times bravo to thy
magnanimity and exalted aim!" 13 On 6 November 1914 Augur met Alexander at Tokyo Station. Having
arrived at Kobe on 1 November 1914, she became the second resident Bahá’í in Japan.

Alexander records that in April 1915 Augur went to Hawaii to rejoin his wife, "expecting to come back
to Japan with her in the fall" but perhaps not having fully decided.14 He wrote ‘Abdu’l-Bahá about his
plans but carried out the decision before receiving a reply. "Dr. Augur felt very strongly the call to
return to Japan," Alexander remembers, "and dear Mrs. Augur would not put anything in his way and
came with him." Shortly after the Augurs arrived in Tokyo, Alexander wrote a letter dated 28 October
1915 in which she describes how Augur reached the decision to return:

> Dr. Augur has told me that before their coming, in Honolulu a dear friend of theirs
> was trying to persuade him that it was a mistake for him to think of returning to
> Japan at this time. He took up the Hidden Words and opened them in order to get
> light, and these were the words which came before his eyes: OH MY SERVANT! Free
> thyself from the worldly bond, and escape from the prison of self. Appreciate the
> value of time for thou shalt never see it again, nor shalt thou find a like opportunity.

These words left no doubt in Dr. Augur’s mind about coming.15

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s response, dated 8 August 1915, had to be forwarded from Honolulu to Tokyo. "Your
beautiful petition ... was read this morning to the Beloved of our hearts," ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s secretary
replied. "His face beamed with heavenly smile as he heard your name. . . . He said: 'Write to Dr. Augur
to return to Japan as soon as the first opportunity offers itself to him. Great blessings will descend
upon the soul who teaches the Cause in that country. Its people are endowed with great capability.'" 16

At first the couple lived in a Japanese inn in Tokyo—an arrangement Augur found comfortable.
According to Agnes Alexander, "He was fond of Japan, and its food and dress appealed to him." 17
Although Ruth Augur used some furniture she had brought from Honolulu, "Dr. Augur kept his room in
the Japanese style, using a cushion to sit on the matted floor." 18

Early in 1916, the Augurs moved from Tokyo to a rented Japanese-style house in Zushi, a town on the
seashore south of Tokyo, where they lived for nearly two years. George Augur returned to Tokyo each
Friday to support the weekly meeting he and Alexander had inaugurated immediately after her arrival
in November 1914. She found him "a great help" because of his knowledge of the Bahá’í teachings. "In
answer to almost any question, he can quote the exact words of ‘Abdu’l-Baha or Baha’u’llah."19 In 1916
Dr. Augur wrote a magazine article titled "What is Bahá’ísm"; published separately as a booklet, it
became one of the first Bahá’í publications in Japanese.20

The Augurs left Zushi for Honolulu in December 1917, but went back to Japan for a final sojourn. From
the fall of 1918 until the spring of 1919, Alexander records, "They rented a little furnished Japanese
house in Tokyo, where they assisted with the Baha’i work." 21

In 1919 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gave permission for the couple to return home:

> Your services at this spot are recognized and appreciated, particularly (your services)
> in Tokyo. . . . These few seeds of corn that ye have sown in that soil shall lead to
> luxuriant crops, this limited number of souls will be converted into great cohorts, nay,
> rather into an imposing spiritual army, and that seed, under the Divine Direction,
> shall yield abundant and heavy clusters. . . . If souls should undertake a voyage from
> America or Honolulu to the land of Japan, the teachings of God shall thereby be
> swiftly propagated and important consequences shall result. You two have fulfilled
> your roles and have striven within the limits of your capacity. At present ye must
> rest for a time; the turn of others has arrived, that they may similarly travel to
> Japan, may water the seeds that have been sown and may serve and take care of
> the tender shrubs. 22
On returning to Honolulu in 1919, Augur resumed his homeopathic practice. The couple continued Bahá’í
activities in their large Beretania Street home until 1927, when they moved to an apartment at the
beach in Waikiki—"not as beautiful as Zushi," Alexander recalls Augur having commented.23 That same
year Augur also communicated to Goodhue his continuing attachment to Japan: "There his kindly
attitude toward all men and things, as well as his artistic temperament, found a rich field for service.
He loved Japan! Like other missionaries who have gone to the wonderful people of Nippon for special
propaganda, he found himself a convert to tolerance and a gentle courtesy." 24

> "This immortal pioneer adopted the Japanese psyche: that is to

> formal kimono, and chose the serene canon of taste which
> consists in putting away all treasures saving but one point of
> contemplation—such as a rose, a vase, book or bibelot."26

list prepared by Shoghi Effendi designates nineteen Western
Bahá’ís as "The Disciples of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: 'Heralds of the Covenant.'" Their photographs appear with
accompanying identifications. In both volumes Augur is number nineteen, described as "Dr. J. G. Augur:
pioneer of the Faith in the Pacific islands." 28
