WINDOWS TO THE PAST
by Darius K . Shahrokh, M.D.

Of all these windows to the past, this window, and only this very
unique window, will show you a priceless gem, a gift from
~ahg'u'll6h. His most precious gift to mankind was His Revelation,
the second was '~bdu'l-~aha',the Mystery of God, whose mystery no
mortal tongue can ever disclose.

'~bdu'l-~ahg walked on this earth as an extraordinary man and a
successor to Bah&'ulll&h, but He was more than a man leading and
guarding the Cause of His Father.        He was not a Manifestation
of God, but indeed He was the repository of the Revelation of
Bahh1u'l16h. A moon in the orb of the Bahh'i Dispensation receiving
its light from Bah6'u1115h, and in the Guardian's words, "a perfect
mirror reflecting the light of Bah&'u'll2th."

His station had been prophesied in the holy books of the past,
and the spiritual intuition of that immortal heroine, ~Ahirih,
enabled her to recognize His station when He was about five years
old. When she was entertaining Him in the house of Bah6'u111&h,
the erudite and distinguished  ahi idhad come to see her, but was
kept waiting in the reception room.      Someone told her, "Maybe
you should not keep  ahi id

waiting any longer." She turned to that
young child, and said, "Shall I leave you, the Protector of the
Cause, to go and visit a follower of the Cause?"     What insight!

His relationship to BahA1u'll&h was not that of an ordinary son
and father. He truly recognized the supreme station of Bah6'u1116h,
and on ‘~bdu ' l-~ah&'s begging, ~ah~'u'll6h granted Him the bounty
of servitude, the greatest attribute in the sight of God. In that,
He became as lowly as offering Himself as dust in the pathway of
His loved ones and thus achieved the highest station.       Doesn't

the lowest valley collect the water flowing from the summit of
a lofty mountain? So did He become the repository of the Revelation
of BahA'u'l16h7 and after BahA'u ' llgh 's Ascension, the fountainhead
of the spiritual energies released by Bah6 'u 'llih.
To enable you to ponder on l~bdu'l-~ahi'sstation and His spiritual
powers, it suffices to refer to the words of Bahh'u'llgh when one
year before His Ascension He addressed the martyr-poet, Hand of
the Cause Varqs in 'Akk6. Bahh'u'llah said, "There is a phenomenon
in this world, those who possess it can exert such influence on
the world which goes beyond their mortal life." In some of His
tablets He has referred to this phenomenon as the "Most Great
Elixir." Then He told Varq&, "Jesus was blessed with that power,
and so is the Master."       VarqA, being overjoyed, prostrated himself
at the feet of Baha1u'll&h and begged that he and one of his sons
be accepted as a sacrifice in the path of 'Abdu'l-Bahs. His wish
was granted. During the ministry of ‘~bdu'l- ah&, he and his
twelve-year-old son, ~ G h 'ullhh, attained the crown of martyrdom.

‘~bdu'l- ah& was born in Tehran, Iran, on May 23, 1844, the day
of the Declaration of the B&b.     His given name was 'Abbis, but
in spite of many exalted titles conferred upon Him by Baha'u'll&h,
after the Ascension of ~aha'u'll&h, He chose the title of '~bdu'l-
Bahh, meaning the Servant of Bahi.

/   ,

His first title was the Master, or Aqa, and shortly after, the
Mystery of God, or Sirru'llih, which was conferred upon Him by
BahG'u'llhh early in the Ba&d;d     years. Later on the titles of
He Around Whom All Names Revolve and Ghusn-i-A'zam, or The Most
Great Branch, were given by ~ah&'u'l%h.         The designation of
Exemplar, used by the believers, is from the writings of Shoghi
Effendi, who stated ‘~bdu'l- ah& was the perfect exemplar of
Bah&'u'll6h's Faith, and endowed with superhuman knowledge.
He was the eldest child of ~ah&'u'll6h, but not the first-born.
In His talk, '~bdu'l-~ah6has stated that when a child, possibly
six years old, He sat on the lap of Tihirih, when from behind the
curtain, as was customary those days, she addressed the erudite
~ a ~ i dencouraging

,         him to show his faith with his action; and that
he did, valiantly, until his martyrdom.

When He was s e v e n y e a r s o l d , He became s e r i o u s l y ill w i t h
t u b e r c u l o s i s , and was n o t e x p e c t e d t o l i v e .     Because o f t h i s , He

f a i n t e d a n d w a s t a k e n home.       How c o u l d H e e v e r erase t h a t gruesome
memory from H i s mind?                  It was a l l t o o much f o r t h a t b a r e l y n i n e -

year-old boy. First, to hear the news of His Father's arrest,
and how on that hot summer day His shoes and hat were removed,
and He was walked for hours in chains to the dungeon.        How He
was mocked and pelted by the onlookers; and, now actually seeing
and smelling the dungeon, and what it had done to His once majestic
Father.
In December, after four months, the good news of ~ah&'u'll6h's
impending release arrived. This was a relief since the rest of
the prominent Biibi leaders had been brutally put to death. However,
with the news came the edict of their exile to Iraq in the dead
of winter.
The family began their journey in January 1853, after ~ah6'u'llah
had somewhat recovered from deadly typhoid fever and leech wounds.
With inadequate provisions, the journey began on foot and some
pack mules. They had to go over the ice-covered and snowbound
mountain passes of western Iran on their way to Baghdad. Sometimes
facing blizzards, they had to go on narrow trails on the edge of
steep mountainsides.      Often '~bdu'l- ah& was carried on the
shoulders of His uncle, Mirz; PIGS&, the faithful brother of
Bahs'u'llhh.     Two of Bah5'u1llhh's faithful brothers went with
them.      One was Mirzii MGsh, a full brother, and the other
~ i r z a Muhammad-~uli, a half-brother.  Mirz5 yahy&, the timid
half-brother of Baha'u'llhh, went into hiding and later joined
them in Bahdad.

'~bdu'l-Bahi's blessed and tender feet froze on that trip, and
c~used Him pain for the rest of His life. The younger brother,
Mirzs Mihdi, only five years old, had to be left behind with
relatives because he was too young for the rigors of that harsh
journey.   He was separated for seven years. hbdu ' 1- ah;'s mother,
who was pregnant, had to cook and wash.       Her delicate hands were
so badly chapped. '~bdu'l- ah; witnessed it all.       Moses was alone
when He was cast out of Egypt.      Bah6'u1ll&h was ill and had His
family with Him; nevertheless, both had to withstand a hardship
beyond endurance of ordinary men.   BahA'u ' ll&h suffered more seeing
what His loved ones had to go through.
Finally they arrived in Ba&dGd in April of 1853. Although I Abdul-
Bahs was only nine years old, He had such spiritual power that

intuitively He recognized the station of His Father, and thus He
was the first to discover His true station. I ~bdu'l-Bahs prostrated
at the feet of Bah6'u'll2ihy and implored for the privilege of laying
down His life in His Path. Bah6'u'll5h granted that He become
the Servant of the Cause. You see, the most pleasing thing in
the sight of God is service.     As the opposite poles of the magnet
are attracted to each other, humility and servitude are the only
attributes man can achieve which are the opposite of the attributes
of majesty and sovereignty of God.     All the other attributes which
man could strive for are possessed by God in absolute perfection.

Although Bahi'u'llhh had alluded to His disappearance, no one
understood its meaning.    It was one year after their arrival in
Ba&dsd  when one morning the household of Bahh'u'llAh woke up to
find Him gone. He had taken a servant and very little provisions.
No one know His whereabouts. His departure was because of the
disunity His half-brother, MirzS yahy6, was causing.      While yahy&
wanted to be close to Bah~'ulll&h,yet he claimed that Bahg'u'llah
was interfering with the ~Abi'srecognition of him.     So Bah5'u111hh
gave him the opportunity to prove himself.      So inept and rejected
he felt , that when Bah5'u'll&h1s whereabouts were discovered, he
sent a letter requesting Bah2i1u'll&h's return.

~ah~'u'll6h's sudden departure for an unknown location was hard
to bear. '~bdu'l- ah;, now about ten years old, suffered the most
because not only was Bah&'u1116h His Father, He was His Lord.
He stated that in those two years He grew old. The family had
no idea about His whereabouts until through various inforqation
reaching Ba&d;d        about a holy man named ~arvish~uharnrnad-i- rani,
the name Bah5'u1ll5h assumed during those two years in the mountains
of ~ u l a ~ m h n i ~ ~they
i h , learned about His location.     ' 1-Baha ,

'~bdu
now twelve years old, and Bahh'ulll&h's full brother, ~irz; M k & ,
dispatched two believers to beg Bah6'u'llhh to return, which he
accepted.

Mirz6 yahyA, who was about twenty-f our years old, was conducting
the affairs of the family and the believers. He had locked himself
in the house fearing danger, but conducted the affairs by
correspondence. He had such fear for his life that when the
youngest child of ~ahg'u'll&h, about one year old, became ill,
he refused to permit a physician or even any neighbor to come for

help. When the little boy died, Mirza Yahya did not allow the
family to have anybody come and prepare his body for burial. The
body was given to a stranger who took it away. What a heartbreak
for '~bdu'1-BahA's mother.

During those two years, 'Abdu'l-~ahg occupied His time with reading
whatever of the Bsb's writings that He could find.    What a joyful
moment when expectantly they heard the footsteps of Bah&'ul llsh,
and saw Him appear at the door in the garb of a dervish. How
touching was 'Abdu' 1-~ahs's embrace of His Father, not letting
go of Him.

In a few years, the extraordinary nature of '~bdu'l- ah; became
manifest to foe and friend. A learned nobleman, ‘~li- hawka at Pashh,
requested that Bahi'u' llAh reveal a commentary on this sentence
from 1sl6mic tradition, ascribed to Muhammad, "I was a hidden
treasure, I wished to be made known, and thus I called creation
into being in order that I might be known."    Baha1u'll6h delegated
this response to '~bdu'l-Bah6, only a teenager without any
schooling.     'Abdu'l-Bah6's   commentary revealed His profound
knowledge, mastery of the language, and rare qualities of mind,
filling the recipient with awe and admiration.         An enemy of
Bahh'u' llAh once remarked that if Bah&'u1116h had no other proof
to substantiate His exceptional powers, raising a son such as

‘Abdu'l- ah; would have been sufficient.

On that April day in 1863, when Bah6'u111ah left His house in
Ba&d6d  for the last time, as He crossed the river in a boat to
enter the Garden of ~idv&n, the boat also carried 'Abdu'l-Bah;,
then eighteen; Mirz6 ~ i h d i , fourteen; and Muhammad- 'Ali, their
half-brother, ten years old.

In the course of four months of their travel to Istanbul with a
caravan of seventy-two companions, 'Abdu'l- ah& rode a horse
alongside His Father. What a majestic sight! He oversaw the
progress of the journey. Provisions for that many people and
animals, and arrangements for their stopping places were His
responsibilities.

The five years in Adrianople saw the rise of Bah~'u1ll~h'sministry
to its zenith, and also witnessed the depths of Mirza Yahyh's evil

deeds. In those years, ~ u r & d d Pgsh6 became the governor of
Adrianople , and his deputy, 'Azlz ~&sh%,

- recognized
greatness. He constantly sought companionship of 'Abdu' 1-~ah6
who was then about twenty-three years old.  Later on we will hear
about this man again.

How distressed was ‘Abdu'l- ah& to see ~ahi'u'll&h poisoned almost
fatally by Mirzii Yahyg, and to hear Dr. ~hishrn&n, who attended
Him at home, to pronounce His condition hopeless. The doctor fell
at Bah&'u1116h's feet , and without prescribing any remedy, left    .
In a few days, the doctor became ill. When Bah6'u1115h's secretary,
~ i r z ai q h Jgn, visited him, the doctor said that God had answered
his prayers: Bah~'ulllhh's illness lasted about a month. He stated
that Dr. --   ShishmAn had sacrificed his life for Him.
Bah6'u'llAh, Who had excellent penmanship, rarely took the pen
after that poisoning due to shaking of His hands.         Among His
writings after the poisoning are His letters to 'Abdu'l-Bah& and
His Will.    In years to follow, how heartbreaking it was for
'Abdu'l-Bahh to receive letters from His Father, and seeing evidence
of His shaking hand, to remember those critical days.

You can imagine what it was to watch the depraved acts of the
desperate Mirza Yahyg. If it was not poisoning of the well which
provided water for the family and believers, it was instructing
their mutual barber, a believer, to kill Bahla'u'lliih while in the
bath.    As mentioned earlier, 'Abdu'l-BahA wished to shield
BahA'u'llAh, but some of the darts passed by Him, yet the Hand
of Providence protected Bahii'u ' ll&h.
Then came the 'Most Great Separation' between ~ahG'u'll&h's
followers and a few who followed MirzG yahy&, soon to be followed
by their exile to 'Akks.      'Abdu ' 1- ah& was twenty-four years old
when He accompanied His Father in exile to 'AkkA.         His youthful
portrait is the passport photo taken for that trip when the only
photographic portrait of Bahi'u'llGh was also taken.

In the barracks of 'Akk;, where ~ahi'u'll6h was confined in a
solitary cell, the rest of nearly seventy companions were placed
in crowded spaces. It was at first a strict decree by the govern-
ment, but these harsh measures did not last long.

He was twelve years old, when after seven years, of separation,
he was sent to his parents, then in exile in Ba&dad,    and now this
tragic separation broke his mother's heart who wept constantly
until Bah6'uTl16h consoled her about the effects of his death.

Four months later the restrictions were relaxed. The prisoners
were placed in houses within the walled city because the government
needed the barracks for military purposes.         After living in a
few houses for a short, t,ime, the large family of Bah6'u1ll5h settled
into the House of 'udi KhammGr. It was so crowded that in one
room thirteen persons of both sexes had to live.       Of course, with
bad publicity about the prisoners, people were not friendly to
them. Matter of fact, when d udi ~hammgrmoved to his large mansion
which later became Bahh'u'll5hfs Mansion of ~ a hij, and rented his
house in town to Baha'u'llhh, it displeased 'AbbGd. Both were
Chri,stians. 'Abbud, who lived next door, was a nephew and partner
of ' ~ d iQamm5r.  Abbud was so upset that he wanted to prevent the
transaction.
Then a shameful event made 'AbbGd feel justified in his fear.
It was shortly after they moved to that house when three followers
of ~ i r z & Yahy& were killed by seven followers of Bah&'u1115h.
These had been sent with Bah&'ulllAh to 'Akk6 by the order of the
government for making mischief.      One of their activities was
constantly reporting to the authorities the arrival of any follower
so they could be expelled before being able to'see Bahi'u'llih.
One such believer was the historian, ~abil-i-A zam, who had to
live in a cave in HaifA.      BahA'u'llGh, foreseeing their action,
had admonished His followers to be forebearing and patient, but
to no avail. t Abdu'l-Bahh was always so vigilant about shielding
His Father, but He had too many fronts to cover. This time the
darts which bypassed Him were from the friends.       Bahi'u'llhh in
that regard stated, "My captivity cannot harm Me. That which can
harm Me is the conduct of those who love Me, who claim to be related
to Me, and yet perpetrate what causeth My heart and My pen to moan.''
This horrible incidence caused jailing of ~ahh'u'llsh and 'Abdu '1-
Bahi, with 'Abdu'l-Bah6 being chained. They spent three days in
jail, but the perpetrators were imprisoned much longer. Of course,
poor 'Abbcd, being afraid for his safety, barricaded his house
against any access from the house of Bahilu'll&h. You can realize

what this noble and holy family had to go through, now being
considered dangerous by their neighbor.
i

Abdu'l-Bah6, Who represented the family, in no time won them all
with His love and charming personality.      It was not unusual for
the people of c' ~ k k iwho had not seen ~ah6'u'llGh to refer to Him
as the Father of 'Abb6s ~ffendi,meaning ‘Abdu'l- ah&.

Soon we will see that the antagonistic 'AbbGd made one hundred
eighty degrees change in his attitude. That is why so many times
those two houses are referred to as the House of '~bbGd.
Let us not lose track of time. Now we are in 1873, five years
after their exile to 'AkkA, and about three years since they left
the barracks. That was a memorable year for that little house
and the whole world. It was within the confines of the House of
'Abbud that the Most Holy Book, or the ~itAb-i-A~das,       was revealed
in the summer of that year, and also that house witnessed the
wedding of 'Abdu ' 1-Bahh to MunFrih KhAnum . 'Abdu ' 1-Bah& was twenty-
nine years old and she was twenty-six. Munirih Kh6num1s given
name was Fgtimih. She was born to a childless couple whom the
B5b blessed while in Isfahan by giving them a portion of food from
His plate.
Baha ' u ' ll5h had intended to have His niece, Shahr-Ban; -   Khanum,
the daughter of His older half-brother, who was :believer,      become
the wife of 'Abdu'l-Baha, which was also the wish of her father.
It is interesting that when BahA'u'llah was in Ba&dAd     and 'Abdu'l-
Bah5 was in His teens, this brother went there, and asked
Baha1u'l16h to bring about the wedding. However, this brother
died before 'Abdu'l-Baha became older. Later on when Bah&'ulllah
sent a believer to Tehran with a ring and cashmere shawl, which
was the customary gift for asking for a woman's hand in marriage,
the other half-sister and half-brother of Bahh 'ulll&h who were
not believers and who had become the guardians of -

Shahr-Bint K&Anum,
refused to let her go to marry 'Abdu'l-Baha.       She was given to
the son of the prime minister instead. This forced marriage brought
her immense grief, and she died from tuberculosis.
~ a h ~ ' u ' l l ~stated

h      that He saw in His dream that the charming face
of - ~ hahr-~kng      -

~ h&num became darker and darker and faded away, and
then one with luminous face and luminous heart appeared to Him,
and He chose her for the Master.    Luminous is the translation
of Munirih.
Now we go to Isfahan, the famous city in Iran well-known for the
turguoise blue mosaic tiles decorating many beautiful domes, unless
you rather stay in drab 'Akkii. Well, we are not going there to
see the colorful mosaics, but to witness the divine mosaic work.
In 1872 from 'AkkL, Bah6'u1ll&h sent a tablet to the King of
Martyrs, then a famous merchant in I~fahgn, stating, "We have
considered you as related to Us." This great believer could not
figure out what Baha'u'llhh was alluding to.    A few months later
-   - Salmgn, the famous courier of Baha'u'llAh, arrived in
Shaykh
Isfahan, and gave the glad tidings that Baha'u1115h had sent him
to escort Fiitimih -Khanurn to 'AkkA. She was the cousin of the
King of Martyrs.

After they arrived in 'Akk;, she stayed for five months at the
home of ~ i r z hMlis5, Bahiilu'll&h's brother, and at times attained
the presence of Bah&'ulllah.        Mirzk MGss often used to bring her
gifts from Baha'u'llgh.       You would guess that she was sure that
she was chosen for 'Abdu'l-~aha. The answer is maybe, until one
day when Mirzh MGsh told her the joyous news that Baha'u'llAh had
sent her the most wonderful gift, and that was the title of Munirih,
meaning luminous.        She became overjoyed having heard about
Bahi'u'llah's dream when He chose the luminous girl, Munirih, for
'Abdu'l-Baha. Now we can say she was sure.
'Abbud detected that the reason the wedding was not taking place
was because of lack of room, so he opened a room from his house
into Bahh'u' llah's house, and offered it for 'Abdu'l-Baha which
BahCilu'llLh accepted. Then the Greatest Holy Leaf gave Munirih
Kh6num a plain white dress, and took her to the presence of
-
Baha'u'llah, Who told her, " 0 My Leaf and My Handmaiden. Verily,
We chose thee, and accepted thee to serve My Most Great Branch,
and this is by My grace which is not equalled by all the treasures
of the earth and heaven"    What a spiritual banquet. No earthly
festivity could match it.
In a short time,_ the unfriendly governor of Akk; was replaced
by Ahmad Big Tawfiq who sought BahA'u'llhh's advice, and had great
respect for the Cause.

In 1875 ‘Abdu'l- ah& wrote His first book which is The Secret of
Divine Civilization."

As we get closer to the end of Baha'u'll&h's stay within the walled
city of 'Akkg, something unusual happened. No, it was not the
dethronement of Sult/an 'Abdu'l- 'Aziz and his assassination. That
had been foretold by ~ah&'u'llhh when they were exiled to 'AkkS.
This was something extraordinary.       After Sultsn 'Abdu'l- 'Azh
was killed, Sultan ‘Abdu'l- amid replaced him. The edict of ~ultgn
was still in force about most strict imprisonment of Bahh'u'llah
and His family. Now listen to this.         Do you remember earlier
I told you we will hear more about ' A Z ~Pa&& who was the deputy
governor of Adrianople during Bahh'u'llhh's stay there?        Well!
Now he has become the v&li or the governor general of Beirut.
He made two separate trips to 'Akk6 to pay his respects to
BahA ' u ' IlAh and seek companionship of 'Abdu ' 1- ah; which he
treasured so much. Then Midhat P G G Q , the prime minister, invited

'Abdu'l-~ah; to Beirut. Who has heard of a governor general to
go and visit a prisoner, and then the prime minister of the realm
invite the prisoner to be his guest?

'Abdu'l-BahA, though considered a prisoner in 'Akka, without
difficulty left for Beirut, and was received honorably by the
dignitaries. This was about 1878 when this liberal prime minister
was in office. Being a reformer, unfortunately, he did not last
too long in that office.
It was during 'Abdu'l-~aha's stay in Beirut when Bah&'ulllah wrote
to Him in these words, "Praise be to Him Who hath honored the Land
of B6 (meaning Beirut) through the presence of Him round Whom all

.

names revolve. .I' and further He states, "Blessed, doubly blessed
is the ground which His footsteps have trodden   ..."  He finishes
the letter by saying, "We beseech God - blessed and exalted be
He - that He may honor us with meeting Him soon."
You can see the love relationship between the Lord and His servant
and vice versa. Sovereignty and humility are the two opposite
poles and attract each other. As was mentioned before, their
relationship was not that of a father and son with its usual and
casual intimacy. When at home, 'Abdu'l-Bahh never entered the
presence of Bahh ' u ' llhh without permission. The half-brothers

I
of ~bdu'l-~ahi,who were blind to the station of Baha'ulll&h,
treated Bahi'u'llAh as their respectable father, but not their
Lord.
When through allusions of Bah&'ul ll&h, '~bdu' l-~ahA sensed that
the time was at hand for BahA'u'll'ah to leave the prison city of

'AkkA, through the ~ u f t i of 'AkkA, He persuaded Bahg1u'l16h to
leave the walled city for the country, namely the Mansion of
Mazra 'ih. Age-wise, ~ah&'u'll&h was sixty years old and 'Abdu'l-
Bahi, thirty-three.    While in Mazra 'ih, 'Abdu'l-BahA stayed in

Akk; as He continued to do so even after ~ahg'u'llah had moved
to the spacious Mansion of ~ a hij .   'Abdu ' l-Bahh negotiated rental,
repair and every requirement for Baha'u'll&hls moves, but He, His
family, sister and mother did not move to that Mansion. The rest
of the family moved to the Mansion of ~ a h j i , and enjoyed the
undeserved bounty of living so close to Baha 'u' llhh.
I

Abdu'l-Bahh used to walk or ride a donkey between '~kk& and the
Mansion of Bahji. When riding, as soon as the Mansion came into
view (like in a mile or so) He would dismount, and walk the rest
of the way. A servant never goes to see his Lord while riding.
BahA1u'l16h would send the believers in attendance to go for a
distance to welcome Him. Then He would stand at the balcony and
state to the women and children, "Look at the Master. Look at
the majesty of His walk." Then '~bdu'l- ah& would climb the stairs,
and prostrate at the feet of Baha'u'llkh.     No one has surpassed
I

Abdu'l-BahA in humility and servitude.

Two years before the Ascension of Baha'u'llhh, when Professor Edward
G. Browne of Cambridge, England, was granted interviews with
Bah5'u1116h, he also wrote this about 'Abdu'l-Baha, who then was
forty-six years old, "Seldom have I seen one whose appearance
impressed me more. A tall, strongly-built man holding himself
straight as an arrow, with white turban and raiment, long black
locks reaching almost to the shoulder, broad, powerful forehead
indicating a strong intellect, combined with an unswerving will,
eyes keen as a hawk's, and strongly-marked but pleasing features-
such were my first impressions of '~bb&s ~ffendi,the Master as
He is called by the Babis."      (Here I wish to interject that for
many years Bahg'is were called ~Abis.) I will repeat the last
sentence. " ....such were my first impressions of 'Abbhs ~ fendif ,
the Master as He is called by the ~Gbis."

> 1'

Subsequent conversation with him served to heighten the respect
with which his appearance had from the first inspired me. One
more eloquent of speech, more ready of argument, more apt of
illustration, more intimately acquainted with the sacred books
of the Jews, the Christians and Muhammadans, could, I should think,
scarcely be found even amongst the eloquent, ready and subtle race
to which he belongs. The qualities, combined with a bearing at
once majestic and genial, made me cease to wonder at the influence
and esteem which he enjoyed even beyond the circle of his father's
followers."

The descriptive pen-portrait by Edward Browne ends with this final
touch, "About the greatness of this man and his power, no one who
had seen him could entertain a doubt." What a powerful pen. You
can almost see and feel the presence of 'Abdu'l-Bah6.
I told    you how I Abdu'l-~ahs, when they lived together with
Bahg'u'llAh in 'AkkA, never went into His presence without
permission. Now, listen to this. Once at the presence of some
believers, a younger half-brother of 'Abdu ' 1-~ahs came casually
to Bah5'u'llAh and said, "The Master wishes that we go to such
a garden, can we?" He was referring to Muhammad- '~1;. Bah5'u111ah
said, "There is only one Master, the rest have their names!"
As mentioned earlier, it was about one year before Bah6'u'llAh's
Ascension when He told Varqh, the martyr-poet , that 'Abdu'l-Bahs
also was blessed with the power of the Holy Spirit.

During His last illness, Baha'u'llah entrusted His Will, written
in His own handwriting, sealed in an envelope, to 'Abdu'l-Baha.
On May 29, 1892, BahA'u'llAh ascended early in the morning. At
dawn "Abdu' 1-BahA and His half-brother , Muhammad- '~li,washed His
body. Before washing, ~uhamrnad-'Ali told 'Abdu ' 1-BahA that the
two cases containing personal items and writings of BahA'ulll&h,
which were close to the bed, might get splashed, and better be
moved to another room.      'Abdu'l-BahL, as you remember, was not
living in the Mansion of ~ a h j i , but Muhamnlad- 'Ali was.     So
~uhumnlad-'All moved the two cases to his own quarters.      Shortly
after the Ascension, a believer came to ‘Abdu'l- ah;, stating that
he had been honored with a tablet by Bahh'u'llAh, and asked if
'Abdu'l-Bah6 could affix Bah6'u'l16h1s seal on it. When 'Abdu1l-Bahg

asked ~uhammad-'Ali to bring the cases, he denied having any
knowledge of them. How badly he wished he could find ~ah&'u'll6h's
Will in order to alter it.
Nine days after the Ascension of BahA'u'llAh, in the presence of
nine believers and the family members, the seal on ~ah&'u'll6h's
Will was broken, and the Will, which Baha'u'llah called Kithb-i-
'Ahdi, or the Book of My Covenant, was read. In English it is
referred to as ~ithb-i2Ahd. It clearly appointed 'Abdu'l-Bahh
as the unquestionable successor to Bahh 'u ' llhh and authorized
interpreter of His words.

On the same day in the afternoon, the Will was read aloud to all
the family members a?d believers who were in '~kks. The one who
read it was Majdi'd-Din, the son of ~ i r z &Mils&, the faithful brother
of Bahii'u'llah, who had passed away five years earlier. This man,
~ajdi'd-s in, who had married a sister of Muhammad- 'Ali, became
a covenant-breaker and with the half-brother of 'Abdu'l-Bahh, rose
against the Covenant. As 'Abdu'l-BahA once told him, he lived
long enough to see the glorious days of the Guardian while paralyzed
and without speech, exactly as predicted by 'Abdu'l-Baha. He died
in 1955 when more than one hundred years old. His house was the
last property _occupied by the covenant-breakers, close to the
Mansion of Bahji, which was torn down by the Guardian.

Muhammad- 'Ali , the half-brother of 'Abdu ' 1-~aha,eight years younger
than Him, with full knowledge of the wishes of Baha'u'llah, broke
the Covenant, and was announced by '~bdu'l-Baha as the Arch-breaker
of the Covenant. He was so deceitful that even when Bahh'u'llkh
was living, he altered some of His writings, and had to be
reprimanded and chastised by Bahh'u'llhh's own hand. For four
years '~bdu'l-Bah6 was patient with him, and assured him that
according to Bah&'u1ll&h's Will, he would be next in line for
successorship, but he arrogantly declared that there was no
guarantee that he would outlive 'Abdu'l-Baha, and he planned to
usurp the position from '~bdu'l- aha exactly the way 'Umar usurped
the successorship from ' 1 the rightful successor to Muhammad.
What arrogance!
With various intrigues and promises, he drew all the half-sisters
and brothers of 'Abdu' 1-~ahd'(and their families), nearly forty

people, into his camp. His main cause was that (Abdu'l-Baha claimed
to be a prophet which was against Bah6'u'llah's writings that no
Manifestation shall appear before one thousand years. What a curse
~uhamrnad-'Ali brought upon himself and others. These unfortunate
people, through their choice, transgressed and sinned against the
Holy Spirit, and therefore their souls will not be forgiven by
God to the end of time which has no end.

It is timely to mention how BahA1u'll6h knew what was coming.
In one of His tablets, He reveals, "My sorrow is not for Myself,
but for Him Who shall come after Me, in the shadow of My Cause,
with manifest and undoubted sovereignty, inasmuch as they will
not welcome His appearance, will repudiate His signs, will dispute
His sovereignty, will contend with Him, and will betray His
Cause.. ." Bah&'ulllah in many of His tablets had cursed the breakers
of His Covenant.
Now all of the covenant-breakers were in the Mansion of ~ahji,
and 'Abdu'l-Bahs, His sister, the Greatest Holy Leaf, 'Abdu'l-~ah&'s
wife and four unmarried daughters lived as before within the walled
city of '~kk&. 'Abdu ' 1-~aha's mother, ~ s i ~ iKhGnum,

h      had passed
away six years before the Ascension of BahA'u'llx. The only other
male in                       household was the faithful half-brother
of Baha'u 'llsh, ~ i r z &Muhammad-~uli. .
How unfortunate was M i r ~ h Aqi JAn, Bahii1u'l15h's secretary for
forty years who chose to go into the camp of the covenant-breakers.
With all of the wealth he had accumulated through gifts which
believers sent to Baha'u'llah, he became their financial support.
The first group of the Western believers, including Phoebe Hearst
and May Bolles (the mother of Amatu'l-Baha ~ G h i ~ ~
manum)

ih   attained
His presence in December of 1898. This group of fifteen went to
'Akka in three successive parties, each one staying only for three
days.
As you recall, ~aha'u'llAh, before His Ascension, while in Haifa ,
pointed out to ‘Abdu'l- ah& where the Shrine of the B&b should
be built.     After His Ascension, 'Abdu'l-~ahi purchased that
specific parcel of land. Soon the covenant-breakers informed the
property owners of surrounding lots that their property would become

/
very valuable to ~bdu'l-Bahg, and should any of them decide to
sell to 'Abdu'l-Bahh, the covenant-bre,akers should be contacted
so they could outbid 'Abdu'l-Bahh. The piece of land for the Shrine
had no access to the road for getting the supplies and equipment
there, and the owner of the needed lot was not willing to sell
it to 'Abdu'l-BahA for any price. So, one night 'Abdu'l-Bah6 stayed
up all night, reciting prayers by the Bhb over and over. The next
morning the stubborn owner approached Him and indicated his willing-
ness to negotiate, but '~bdu'l-Bah& would not show any interest.
The owner felt very guilty, saying he had been a victim of the
mischief of the covenant-breakers. He kept bringing the price
down, and even offered to give it away free. 'Abdu'l-Bah'a told
His attendant to purchase it for a fair price.

In 1899, the same year that the holy dust of the Biib was brought
to the Holy Land, '~bdu'l-~ahAlaid with His own hands the corner-
stone of the Shrine. These covenant-breakers did everything to
make life miserable for 'Abdu'l-Bah;, His family and the steadfast
followers.      In particular, Muhammad- ' ~ l iwas determined to cause
< Abdu'l-BahA's   execution or exile ,to a very remote place. Since
they occupied the Mansion of Bahji, any time 'Abdu'l-Bahh and the
believers went to the Shrine of Bahit'u'llAh, they would stand on
the balcony and harrass them.
With repeated reports to the government Muhammad-'~1: and his allies
stated that '~bdu'l-Bah;, with the help of the Westerners, was
building a fortress on Mount Carmel to take over the government.
You should know that during this period, ‘~bdu'l- aha lived in
'Akka, but had a temporary residence and guest house in Haifa where
He often visited, and stayed for short periods.

To bribe the officials against '~bdu'l-Baha , they gave them some
of the personal belongings of Bahg'u'llah.     One official who had
such an item tried to tease '~bdu'l-Bah6, but soon learned' not
to do it again. He had the prayer beads of Bah&'ulll&h in his
hands which '~bdu' 1-Bah6 immediately recognized. What his intent-
ions were, we don't know.    If he wanted to make a fortune or just
tease, God knows. He asked 'Abdu'l-Bah;,    "How much do you think
these beads are worth?" 'Abdu'l-BahA stated, "It depends in whose
hands they are!"

It was on a hot August night in   1901 when Abdu'l-Bah6, just having
returned from ~ a h j i where He had celebrated the anniversary of
the Declaration of the B6b, was informed about the edict of the
Sultan. The order was that '~bdu'l-~ah6must stay strictly within
the confines of the walled city of '~kk6, and in this process,
the covenant-breakers were also caught in their own web. They
were ordered to move from the Mansion of ~ a h j ito 'Akkg. Who else
except ‘Abdu'l- ah& would intercede on their behalf to the govern-
ment so they could stay in the Mansion?       They stabbed Him with
daggers, He balmed their wounds; they caused Him agony, He brought
them comfort. Yes, indeed, who else, except the Exemplar, the
Master. But this did not stop them. They became bolder, and their
intrigues became wilder.
The reincarceration of IAbdu'l-BahG and His strict confinement
within the city of 'Akka lasted from 1901 to 1908. During those
seven years, the flow of pilgrims slowed down considerably, and
towards the end stopped due to the restrictions imposed upon
hbdu ' 1-BahA .

While 'Abdu'l-~ahg was confined within the city of 'Akka, the
construction of the Shrine of the Bab was not interrupted. The
covenant-breakers, living comfortably in the Mansion of ~ a h j i ,
felt ever more at liberty to pursue their evil schemes by bribing
the authorities and giving receptions. Their ultimate goal was
total elimination of ‘Abdu'l- ah&, and taking leadership of the
Cause for personal gain.

As stated by 'Abdu ' 1-Baha , His greatest suffering during those
years was His inability and deprivation from visiting the Shrine
of Bahatu'l15h. He continued His correspondence with the believers
in the East and the West. Many so-called non-Baha'i friends in
'AkkA kept their distance, worrying about their own status and
positions. The most descriptive book about those years is -    The

-
Memoirs of Nine Years in 'AkkA, by Dr. YGnis-i-AfrGkhtih,    which
hopefully will be translated into English.
In those years to follow, ~uhammad-'Ali even conspired to take

> ‘Abdu' l-~ahg's 'life through assassins. Like his cousin, Majditd-
> in, Muhammad- ~ l ialso outlived 'Abdu'l-Bahg by sixteen years,
and with envy watched the establishment of the power of the Covenant

and ministry of the Guardian.   However, they caused great hardship
for 'Abdu' 1-Bah6.

It is interesting that the youngest half-brother of 'Abdu' 1-~ah6,
~ i r z 6Badi 'u'llhh, who was in his mid-thirties , decided to change
camps, and began to attend the meetings of the believers at the
presence of 'Abdu'l-BahA.       He definitely had his eye on the
successorship. 'Abdu'l-Bah; told him that He would accept his
repentance, and forgive him if he would write down all of the, evil
doings that were implemented by older brother Muhammad- 'Ali and
his allies. Bad~'u1ll6h did as he was told, and by this he left
a clear record of their activities.        Being forgiven by 'Abdu'l-
Bah5, he began to feel the status of being a son of ~ah6'u'llhh.
Some believers went to the extreme of kissing his hand.

Then in one gathering of the believers where Badi'u'llah was also
present, 'Abdu'l-BahA said everyone should take note of what He
had to say. He stated that in case of His passing away, the
Universal House of Justice should be elected to conduct the affairs
of the Faith. Well, what do you think! It was a clear message
to Badi'u'llsh, who after a short time went back to his old camp,
because his hopes of leadership after ' Abdu ' 1-~ah6were dashed.

\[1\] ~bdu'l-Bahs's daily work of attending the sick and the poor was
not interrupted for a moment. In those distressful days, He stayed
up until way past midnight keeping up His communications. He wrote
as many as ninety letters per day. Now you know how there are
between twenty-six to twenty-seven thousand letters from His pen.

Early in the winter of 1907, a few days before the arrival of the
henchmen of the SultAn, (Abdu'l-Baha had a dream which He shared
with the believers.' He saw a ship cast its anchor near 'Akka,
and from it flew a few birds which resembled sticks of dynamite.
These came inland, and circled around His head while He was standing
amidst the multitude of frightened inhabitants. Then the dynamites
returned back to the ship without ever exploding. The dreaded moment
arrived with the four-member board of inquiry sent by the central
government to complete their long-stretched and off and on investi-
gations.   Upon their arrival, the governor of 'AkkA, who was
friendly towards ' Abdu' 1- ah&, was dismissed. The board also took
over the telephone and telegraph office, the nerve center of

L
had come to take Abdu'l-BahA with them. The believers could not
sleep. They kept vigil until the final day arrived. You can almost
hear the pounding of their hearts and feel their shattered nerves.
The board made its last inspection of the Shrine of the Bab which
was still under construction. Seeing the underground vault left
no doubt in their minds about the purpose of that unusual and solid
construction. The believers along the shore kept their vigil,
and watched the movement of the ship in the bay as it left Haifa.
Well, that was it. They were coming to 'Akk; to take 'Abdu'l-Bahh.
Now that the sun was setting they could see the ship even better
with its lights on. The ship began slowly to move back towards
'Akkg, and this was the sure sign that 'Abdu'l-~ah6 would be
arrested at any moment.

Meanwhile, / Abdu'l-BahA was calmly pacing in the courtyard of His
house. All of a sudden, to great surprise of the believers, the
ship changed its course, and headed towards the open sea.
Apparently, urgent news had come to the officials that a bomb had
exploded near the carriage of Sultan    ‘Abdu'l- amidwhile he was
returning from the mosque. With the gravity of such an attempt
on the life of the sultan, everything else was put on the back
burner, and the officials were summoned to return at once to
IstAnbul. It did not take too long before the sultan was forced
to submit to the demand of the revolutionaries.      In the summer
of 1908, the constitution was reinstated, and all the religious
and political prisoners were freed.
Then on that ~ a w - ~ Gday

z of 1909, He laid with His own hands the
sacred remains of the B6b and His companion-martyr in the heart
of Mount Carmel at the shrine which as stated by Him, "Every brick
of it was laid with the labor of love, and every inch of it was
raised with tears of agony." At the final moment of that emotional
event, He took off His turban, shoes, and cloak, and laid His
blessed head on the corner of the casket, and cried so intensely
that it made everyone there weep with Him.   With all the services
that 'Abdu'l-Bah5 rendered, He considered this one His greatest
accomplishment. The same night a telegram arrived about the forma-
tion of the first Baha'i national convention of delegates in
Chicago.

Within the course of one year, His household was gradually trans-

ferred to His newly-built house in Haifa.   At the age of sixty-
five, He left '~kkiforever, never to set foot within the city
gates of '~kk6again. He was twenty-four years old when He entered
'Akk6 as a prisoner.

With the gates opened, the flood of believers began to flow, and
His correspondence ever increased. It was not unusual that He
simultaneously kept three secretaries writing separate letters
in three languages of Persian, Arabic and Turkish. Shoghi Effendi,
His eldest grandson, at times acted as His secretary for correspond-
ence in English. 'Abdu'l-BahA slept and ate very little.         His
diet included bread, goat milk, cheese, tea and olives. Many times
at dinner table He served the believers and the company Himself.
While some were spellbound by His presence, He would remind them
to eat.
In the evening of His life at the age of sixty-seven in 1911, He
began His extensive journeys. First He went to Egypt, and on
April 11, 1912, He arrived in New York on the steamship Cedric,
having refused the reservation which dedicated believers had made
on the maiden voyage of the luxurious Titanic. You can guess why?
He covered many cities from coast-to-coast, speaking about the
Cause of Bahh'u'llah in churches, synagogues, and universities.
From lonesome imprisonment in the desolate 'Akkh to the overcrowded
lecture halls of the United States and Europe!     If that animation
was not from the power of the Holy Spirit, what else could it be?
He met po1iticia.n~and scientists such as Theodore Roosevelt and
Alexander Graham Bell. After meeting Lee McClung, the United States
treasurer, Juliet Thompson asked McClung what was his impression
of 'Abdu'l-Bahh.   These are his exact words, "I seemed to be in
the presence of one of the great old prophets - Isaiah, Elijah,
Moses. And yet it was more than that - He was like Christ. No,
now I have it - He seemed to me like my Divine Father."
'Abdu'l-Baha laid the corner-stone of the House of Worship in
Wilmette, Illinois in May, 1912.      While in the United States,
He made a side trip to Montreal, Canada. While on the West Coast,
He visited the grave of Thornton Chase in Los Angeles who had died
just before His arrival in California.     He returned to New York,
the City of the Covenant, and on December 5, 1912, He left New

York by a steamship for Liverpool on His way to London.         Then
He visited a few European cities such as Paris and Stuttgart.
The last leg of His extensive and historic journey was Egypt where
He spent about five months. He returned to the Holy Land on
December 5, 1913, at the eve of World War I which He had predicted.

His journey to the West and long absence from the Holy Land had
two purposes; one was to raise the call of Y6 Baha'u'l-~bh6 first-
hand in the remote cities of the West; and, the second was to show
the world that the institution of the Covenant was so firmly
established that His half-brother, the arch-breaker, and his allies,
in spite of His absence, had no power. He accomplished both
missions to perfection.
Before the onset of the world war and after it began, He advised
the believers to cultivate large fields of land and plant grain
which was stored. When the famine struck, He gave grain to the
needy.
It was towards the end of that war when Jamal pisha, the Turkish
commander-in-chief and a bitter enemy of the ~ a l T h ,allied with
Germans, expressed his intention to crucify '~bdu'1-Bahh and level
the Shrine of Bah5'u1116h. However, through the efforts of the
British believers, the Foreign Office advised General Allenby,
the commanding officer in that region, to extend all protection
to '~bdu'l-Bah6 which was done promptly and effectively.
After the liberation of Palestine by the British forces, at a
ceremony specially held for His sake in Haifa, General Allenby
conferred the British knighthood upon ‘~bdu'l- ah& for His humanit-
arian services to the public during the famine in those gloomy
days of war.
Among other highlights of twenty-nine years of His ministry were
the erection of the first House of Worship in f 1shqhbhd in Russian
Turkistan, and repair of the House of the Bbb in -

~Xrhz.

'Abdu'l-BahG's writings could be classified in these categories:
1. The Will and Testament, that unmatched document which

> established the Administrative Order and appointment
> of Shoghi Effendi as the Guardian.
2. The books He wrote are three:

> - The Secret of Divine Civilization, written in 1875.
- A Traveller's Narrative which is a brief history of

the Faith.
- Memorials of the Faithful, in which He honors a number

of outstanding early believers.

The third category are the compilations of His talks and tablets
under the following titles:
- Some Answered Questions by Laura Clifford Barney

> which are His table-talks in Akka during His
> reincarceration.

> - Paris Talks.
- Promulgation of Universal Peace, which are His talks

in the United States.
- The Tablets of the Divine Plan, which are fourteen

> tablets written in 1916 and 1917 addressed to the
> believers in the U.S. and Canada for the spiritual
> conquest of the planet.
The last in this category is Selections from the Writings of

'~bdu'l-~ahs. The fourth category are His numerous letters to
individuals in regard to explanations of Bah6'u1llAh's writings
and other matters.
His mission fully accomplished, the Mystery of God, or as He wished
to be known, '~bdu'l-Bahh, ascended to the world of mysteries on
November 28, 1921, in Haifa at the age of seventy-seven.
His funeral, the like of which the Holy Land had never witnessed
before, was attended by nearly ten thousand people from every class,
color, and creed; as high as the High Commissioner of Palestine,
and as low as the beggars who received alms from His hands. All
united as He wished them to be, mourned the loss of their beloved
'~bdu'l-~ahs. He was laid to rest in a vault in a room adjacent
to the room of the resting-place of the BAb under the same shrine
which He built so fervently with the labor of love and tears of
agony. Messages of sympathy began to pour in from far and near.
One was from no less a person than the British Secretary of State
for the Colonies, Mr. Winston Churchill, who conveyed the sympathy
and condolences on behalf of His Majesty's government.
His Will and Testament, which was addressed to Shoghi Effendi,

was read five weeks after His Ascension. Shoghi Effendi was in
London when 'Abdu'l-Bahh passed away, and sailed to Haifa after
his recovery from that shocking news.

Friends, by reading three excellent books, God Passes By, by Shoghi
Effendi; 'Abdu'l-~ah6, by the late Hand of the Cause H. M. Balyuzi;
and The Covenant of Baha'u'llah, by Adib Taherzadeh, you can easily
recognize the limitation of this short presentation. Let us hope
that this brief account of such a momentous life has excited your
interest for deeper study of the life and ministry of 'Abdu'l-Bah6,
the Mystery of God.
