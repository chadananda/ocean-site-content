Abstract

Hagiography (the study of the lives of the saints) is a literary
genre that originated as a way of proposing to a largely illiterate
audience inspirational life histories worthy of emulation.

This paper will present a brief comparison between the
foremost example of Muslim hagiography (A††ár’s Tadhkirat al-
Auliya’) and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Memorials of the Faithful by citing
two biographies from A††ár’s work (Rábi‘ah Al-‘Adawiyya and
Shaykh Báyazid al-Bistámí) and two from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s book
(Mishkín Qalam, and Shams-i-Duhá), to show how hagiography
highlights concrete examples of desirable spiritual virtues.

Hagiography is defined as the writing and critical study of
the lives of the saints. This genre of literature first originated in
the Roman Empire as stories and legends about Christian
martyrs were collected and later presented in a written form.

326                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 17

The dates of their deaths formed the basis of martyriologies. In
the 4th century, there were three main types of catalogs of lives
of the saints: the Menaion, or biographies of the saints to be
read at sermons; the Synaxarion, a short collection of lives of
the saints, arranged by date; the Paterikon, the biography of
specific saints, chosen by the catalog compiler.

In Western Europe, during the Middle Ages, hagiography
became one of the vehicles for the study of inspirational history
and a pedagogical tool by which a Christian code of conduct
could be taught to a largely uneducated and often illiterate
population. The life of Christ was the benchmark against which
saints were measured, and the lives of saints were the
benchmark against which the general population measured
itself. The stories offered clear patterns to emulate.

Hagiography was fundamental in developing the practice of
veneration of saints that lay at the heart of the practice of late
antique and medieval Christianity. Integral parts of this practice
were the veneration of relics (from the Latin reliquiae or
“remains”: parts of a holy person’s body or possessions, or
simply objects might have come in contact with the saint) and
icons (holy portraits of saints and prophets), and the
commemoration of the day of the saint’s death as a holy day.
Prayers, offerings and pious acts performed on such holy days,
or at the shrines that contained such relics and icons, the living
Christian could seek the help of the saintly dead now residing in
Heaven.

From another perspective, hagiography preserved much
valuable information about religious beliefs, customs, daily life,
institutions, and events over certain historical periods.

Islamic hagiographic literature presents two distinct genres,
one concerning individuals of exclusive religious status (“saints”
or “holy men”) and one devoted to the biographies of the
Prophet Mu˙ammad and the Shi’ite Imams. The primary
purpose of the 11th century works in the Sufi tradition appears
to be the defense of mysticism and its adherents stressing that

the conduct and doctrines of eminent Sufis were in accordance
with the texts of the Muslim revelation.

The main purpose of the hagiographer is “to transmit to a
believing and pious audience matters of practical spiritual
value; the specifically ‘human’—the whole stuff of modern
biography—is trivial and profoundly uninteresting from a
traditional viewpoint” [Algar 134] which makes it extremely

328                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

difficult to extract an actual biography (in the modern sense, as
Algar points out) of the saint from the information at hand.

A Comparison between Tadhkirat al-Auliya’
(Memorial of the Saints) by Faríd al-Din A††ár
and Tadhkiratu’l-Vafá (Memorials of the Faithful)
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

Faríd al-Din A††ár

In the words of Arberry, who translated parts of the
Tadhkirat al-Auliya’, “Faríd al-Din A††ár is accounted amongst
the greatest poets of Persia; his dimensions as a literary genius
increase with the further investigation of his writings, which are
still far from completely explored, though welcome progress has
been made of late in their publication” [Arberry, “Introduction” 1].

Born circa 540 AH (1145-46 CE) at Nishapur (where he died
in 618 AH/1221 CE) A††ár was not only a poet but also a
hagiographer and a theoretician of mysticism. While his

> attended to a very large number of customers.... It seems
> that ʿA††ár was not well known as a poet in his own

> the 7th/13th century onward, ʿA††ár’s prose work,
> the Tadkerat al-awlíáʾ, came to be widely read... but his
> greatness as a mystic, a poet, and a master of narrative
> was not discovered until the 9th/15th century.... In

> adequate picture can be obtained from his writings.

[Reinert]

Tadhkirat al-Auliya’, A††ár’s only prose work,

> is a collection of biographies dedicated to exponents and
> pioneers of classical Sufism... The work gives a sort of
> hagiographic summary of his career in the ethical and
> experiential world of the Sufis (see above). It is to be
> regretted that he hardly ever names his sources. He
> appears to have relied almost entirely, if not exclusively,
> on written sources. In his choice and narration of

> taste of his own. Comparisons with versions of the same
> material in works by other authors suggest that he
> presented and interpreted the stories somewhat
> idiosyncratically.... On the other hand, he translated
> sayings of his Sufis, which had come down in Arabic,
> very faithfully into Persian. [Reinert]

Why did A††ár write the Tadhkirat al-Auliya’? Islamist Arthur
J. Arberry cites Reynold A. Nicholson (another translator of
A††ár’s work) who summarizes as follows some of the possible
reasons:
1\. He was begged to do so by his religious brethren.
2\. He hoped that some of those who read the work would bless

> the author and thus, possibly, secure his welfare beyond the
> grave.
330                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 17

3\. He believes that the words of the Saints are profitable even

> to those who cannot put them into practice, inasmuch as
> they strengthen aspiration and destroy self-conceit.

....
5\. According to the Prophet, “Mercy descends at the mention of

> the pious”: peradventure, if one spreads a table on which
> Mercy falls like rain, he will not be turned away portion less.
6\. A††ár trusts that the blessed influence of the Saints may be

> vouchsafed to him and bring him into happiness before he
> dies.
7\. He busied himself with their sayings in the hope that he might

make himself to resemble them.
8\. The Koran and the Traditions cannot be understood without

> knowledge of Arabic, wherefore most people are unable to
> profit by them; and the Sayings of the Saints, which form a
> commentary on the Koran and the Traditions, were likewise
> uttered, for the most part, in Arabic. Consequently the
> author has translated them into Persian, in order that they
> may become accessible to all.

....
10\. Spiritual words alone appeal to the author. Hence he

> composed this “daily task” for his contemporaries, hoping
> to find some persons to share the meal which he has
> provided.
11\. The Imam Yusuf Hamadhani advised some people, who

> asked him what they should do when the Saints had passed
> away from the earth, to read eight pages of their Sayings
> every day. A††ár felt that it was incumbent upon him to
> supply this desideratum.

....
13\. In the present age the best men are bad, and holy men have

> been forgotten. The Memorial is designed to remedy this
> state of things.

14\. The Sayings of the Saints dispose men to renounce the

> world, meditate on the future life, love God, and set about
> preparing for their last journey. “One may say that there
> does not exist in all creation a better book than this, for
> their words are a commentary on the Koran and Traditions,
> which are the best of all words. Anyone who reads it
> properly will perceive what passion must have been in the
> souls of those men to bring forth such deeds and words as
> they have done and said.”
15\. A further motive was the hope of obtaining their

> intercession hereafter and of being pardoned, like the dog
> of the Seven Sleepers which, though it be all skin and bone,
> will nevertheless be admitted to Paradise. [xxv–xxviii]

The Four Saints Compared in this Paper

It is not easy to choose only four stories from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
and A††ár’s books, but I have decided to dwell on the following
characters because their stories highlight divine intervention in
each life. In these stories we can catch a glimpse of both
humanity and eternity in the daily actions of the individuals,
and in the simplicity with which they turn their hearts to their
Creator in prayer and devotion. Just like any of us, these are
people who wish to pray, yet can be distracted by the outward
world and by inner voices; they are bound by the necessities of
material life, yet they can be grateful for both adversity and
prosperity, for the fruits of their labors and for Divine
providence.

Studying the lives of the saints, we can be struck by the
profound spirituality and detachment that characterize them.
These qualities define their lives to the point that they become
symbol and metaphor of our own constant endeavors toward
new heights of comprehension that will open new vistas to our
spiritual eyes, just the way climbing up a mountain expands our
horizons and affords us, puny creatures, an unprecedented view
of the valleys below.

The climb may be arduous and tiring but is the sure path to
the goal of our aspirations: nearness to our Creator, the chance
to reflect the splendour of His attributes in our person, a keen
and crystalline vision of reality.

Báyazid

Abú Yazid al-Bistámí, also known as Báyazid (d.874), was
born in Bistám, a very important Iranian town of the Abbasid
age (750-1258). One of the most celebrated Sufis, he is the first
who pronounced those seemingly blasphemous utterances which
imply the mystic’s identification with God, such as: ‘Glory be to
me’ or ‘I am Thou’ or ‘I am I’. He may have escaped
martyrdom, despite his audacious sayings, because he was
thought to be crazy. Báyazid left no writings, but some five
hundred of his sayings have been preserved by his biographers.

Bahá’u’lláh quotes in the Four Valleys words which have been
ascribed to Báyazid:

> Hence, one of the Prophets of God... hath asked: ‘O my
> Lord, how shall we reach unto Thee And the answer
> came, ‘Leave thyself behind, and then approach Me.’ [55]

Words very similar to these are ascribed to Abu Yazid by
‘A††ár in his Tadhkirat al-Awliyá. ‘A††ár writes that once
Báyazid dreamt God Himself, Who told him: ‘What do you
wish, O Báyazid?’ The Highest answered: ‘Whatever is Thy wish,
O God.’ And God answered: ‘O Báyazid! I want you, as you
want Me.’ Then Báyazid asked Him again: ‘But which road is
leading unto Thee?’ And God answered: ‘O Báyazid! Whoever
renounces his own self will attain unto Me.’ Ibn al-‘Arabi
himself ascribes these words to Báyazid in his Futúhát: “The
Prophet... said to Abu Yazid, ‘Leave aside yourself and come’”
[IV. 306.20, quoted in Chittick, Self-Disclosure 180].

> ... If the words ‘one of the Prophets of God’... refer to
> Báyazid, we may think that Bahá’u’lláh considered him as
> a spiritually advanced seeker. [Savi 514–15]

Mishkín-Qalam in Memorials of the Faithful

> He wielded a musk-black pen, and his brows shone with
> faith. He was among the most noted of mystics, and had
> a witty and subtle mind.

> ... This highly accomplished man first heard of the Cause
> of God in Ißfahán, and the result was that he set out to
> find Bahá’u’lláh. He crossed the great distances,
> measured out the miles, climbing mountains, passing
> over deserts and over the sea, until at last he came to
> Adrianople. Here he reached the heights of faith and
> assurance; here he drank the wine of certitude. He
> responded to the summons of God, he attained the
> presence of Bahá’u’lláh, he ascended to that apogee
> where he was received and accepted.

> ... After the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh, Mishkín-Qalam
> remained loyal, solidly established in the Covenant. He
> stood before the violators like a brandished sword. He
> would never go half way with them; he feared no one but
> God; not for a moment did he falter, nor ever fail in
> service.

> ... He had amazing verve, intense love. He was a
> compendium of perfections: believing, confident,
> serene, detached from the world, a peerless companion, a
> wit—and his character like a garden in full bloom. For
> the love of God, he left all good things behind; he closed
> his eyes to success, he wanted neither comfort nor rest,
> he sought no wealth, he wished only to be free from the
> defilement of the world.... For sincerity and loyalty he
> had no match, nor for patience and inner calm. He was
> selflessness itself, living on the breaths of the spirit. [MF
> 98–101]

Shams-i-Duhá

> Mírzá Hádí, an uncle of the King of Martyrs and the
> Beloved of Martyrs, became an ardent believer in the
> early days of the Faith. He was present at the Conference
> of Badasht, suffered persecutions, was attacked in that
> vicinity and died there. His wife Shams-i-Duhá, a close
> companion of Táhirih, was described by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as
> the ‘eloquent and ardent handmaid of God’. [Taherzadeh 16]

> Khurshíd Begum, who was given the title of Shamsu’d-
> Duhá, the Morning Sun, was mother-in-law to the King
> of Martyrs. This eloquent, ardent handmaid of God was
> the cousin on her father’s side of the famous
> Mu˙ammad-Báqir of Isfáhán, widely celebrated as chief
> of the ‘ulamás in that city. When still a child she lost
> both her parents, and was reared by her grandmother in
> the home of that famed and learned mujtahid, and well
> trained in various branches of knowledge, in theology,
> sciences and the arts.

> Once she was grown, she was married to Mírzá Hádíy-i-
> Nahrí. In Karbilá they attended some classes, imbibing the
> knowledge of the Siyyid, so that this handmaid became
> thoroughly informed on subjects relating to Divinity, on
> the Scriptures and on their inner meanings. The couple
> had two children, a girl and a boy. They called their son
> Siyyid ‘Alí and their daughter Fátimih Begum, she being
> the one who, when she reached adolescence, was married
> to the King of Martyrs. [MF 180–81]

Shams-i-Duhá in Memorials of the Faithful

> From being with Táhirih, Shams profited immeasurably,
> and was more on fire with the Faith than ever. She spent
> three years in close association with Táhirih in Karbilá.
342                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> As Táhirih became celebrated throughout Karbilá, and
> the Cause of His Supreme Holiness, the Báb, spread all
> over Persia, the latter-day ‘ulamás arose to deny, to heap
> scorn upon, and to destroy it. They issued a fatvá or
> judgment that called for a general massacre. Táhirih was
> one of those designated by the evil ‘ulamás of the city as
> an unbeliever, and they mistakenly thought her to be in
> the home of Shamsu’d-Duhá. They broke into Shams’s
> house, hemmed her in, abused and vilified her, and
> inflicted grievous bodily harm. They dragged her out of
> the house and through the streets to the bázár; they beat
> her with clubs; they stoned her, they denounced her in
> foul language, repeatedly assaulting her. While this was
> going on, Óájí Siyyid Mihdí, the father of her
> distinguished husband, reached the scene. “This woman is
> not Táhirih!” he shouted at them. But he had no witness
> to prove it, and the farráshes, the police and the mob
> would not let up. Then, through the uproar, a voice
> screamed out: “They have arrested Qurratu’l-‘Ayn!” At
> this, the people abandoned Shamsu’d-Duhá.

> ... She spent her days and nights in the remembrance of
> God and in teaching His Cause to the women of that
> city. She was gifted with an eloquent tongue; her
> utterance was wonderful to hear. She was highly honored
> by the leading women of Isfáhán, celebrated for piety,
> for godliness, and the purity of her life. She was chastity
> embodied; all her hours were spent in reciting Holy
> Writ, or expounding the Texts, or unraveling the most
> complex of spiritual themes, or spreading abroad the
> sweet savors of God.

> ... So vehement was the fiery love in her heart that it
> compelled her to speak out, whenever she found a
> listening ear. And when it was observed that once again
> the household of the King of Martyrs was about to be
> overtaken by calamities, and that they were enduring

> severe afflictions there in Isfáhán, Bahá’u’lláh desired
> them to come to the Most Great Prison. Shamsu’d-Duhá,
> with the widow of the King of Martyrs and the children,
> arrived in the Holy Land. Here they were joyously
> spending their days when the son of the King of Martyrs,
> Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Husayn, as a result of the awful suffering
> he had been subjected to in Isfáhán, came down with
> tuberculosis and died in Akká. [MF 182–90]

Conclusions

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s and A††ár’s books differ in one aspect: the
individuals portrayed by A††ár have either performed miracles
or great heroic acts; in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s work, instead, we meet
both people who have distinguished themselves for their
heroism and simple people who demonstrate in their daily
existence the meaning of living a spiritual life. The reason these
latter believers are an example for the reader is their very
simplicity: true heroism is living one’s life and being steadfast
through the tests that give us the opportunity to grow
spiritually. Spirituality is a conscious endeavor developed
through prayer and meditation but also through the simple acts
of daily life: dedication to one’s profession, deeds that benefit
our neighbor, constant control of our impulses, and fellowship
and brotherhood with all people, while remaining confident and
contented even during life’s hardest times. “The point is this,
that faith compriseth both knowledge and the performance of
good works.” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá, cited in Research Department Memorandum
to the Universal House of Justice]

While some may suffer persecution or even martyrdom
because of their beliefs and demonstrate thusly their love for
the Faith, for those of us living in countries that enjoy freedom
of religion, remaining faithful to certain spiritual values in a
society that rejects them is in itself an act of heroism—these two
different sacrifices assume the same meaning. Martyrdom, in
this case, consists of taking hold of our ego—our lower nature—

and, through constant effort, raise it to the noble station for
which it is destined.

In the lives celebrated in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Memorials, we can
perceive an exhortation to rethinking the role of the individual
in society. If we observe carefully, we will notice how the
negative example of a single individual—a corrupt politician,
for example, or an employee who is unable to work
cooperatively in a group—can become a problem that affects
the entire community. At the same time, we are impressed by
virtuous individuals who demonstrate in their lives adherence to
behaviors oriented toward fellowship to and respect for others,
and we hold them up as examples to emulate. We feel a strong
attraction for a time and space in which to develop our ideals
and our values. The humble yet powerful lesson of the believers
remembered in Memorials encourages personal discipline in
every aspect of life, that by the dynamic force of our example, a
healthier and more balanced society may come to life.
