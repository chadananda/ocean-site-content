## Anne Gould Hauberg and Mark Tobey: Lives Lived for Art, Cultivated by Spirit

### by [Anne Gordon Perry](https://bahai-library.com/author/Anne+Gordon+Perry)

published in [_Journal of Bahá'í Studies_](https://bahai-library.com/series/JBS), 26:4, pages 94-104  
Ottawa: Association for Baha'i Studies North America, 2016


> **Abstract:** Seattle art patron Anne Gould Hauberg (1917–2016) and Seattle-based painter Mark Tobey (1890–1976) shared a common interest in art and faith. Their friendship spanned decades, with Hauberg providing patronage for Tobey, who, along with creating significant works of art for her and other Northwest collectors, taught her about the Bahá'í Faith, which guided her for the rest of her life. Following the recent death of Hauberg, the author reflects on her visits with the two art lovers — visits that occurred forty years apart — and pays tribute to them as individuals and as friends who nurtured and helped to sustain each other.

in Hauberg’s abode. She, too, was nearing the end of her days, but she placed a
high importance on the maintenance of all that she had acquired—and some-
times had helped to create—in a life blessed by affluence and a quest for beauty.
Art, faith, and a deep respect for artists’ contributions to the world threaded each
of their tapestries.

While I cannot adequately describe either Tobey or Hauberg or their impact
upon my own life or art, these visits were of profound significance to me. In my
imagination, we—and other souls committed to the comingling of art and spir-
it—are all intertwined in worlds to come.
