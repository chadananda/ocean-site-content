**BARAḠĀNĪ** MOLLĀ **MOḤAMMAD-TAQĪ,** QAZVĪNĪ, ŠAHĪD-E ṮĀLEṮ, an important Shiʿite _ʿālem_ of Qazvīn (d. 1263/1847). Baraḡānī was the first cleric to declare _takfīr_ (ca. 1238/1822) against Shaikh Aḥmad Aḥsāʾī, and subsequently became the leading opponent of Shaikhism in Iran. He studied in Iran and Iraq, and accompanied his teacher, Moḥammad-ʿAlī Ṭabāṭabāʾī, on the 1242/1826 jihad against Russia. After a disagreement in Tehran with Fatḥ-ʿAlī Shah, he returned to Qazvīn, where he acquired a reputation as one of the best preachers of his day. His best-known work is the _Majāles al-mottaqīn_ on the sufferings of the imams. His brother, Moḥammad Ṣāleḥ, wrote numerous works on this theme. His niece, Fāṭema (Qorrat-al-ʿAyn), became famous as a Babi leader but Moḥammad-Taqī’s own opposition to Shaikhism and Babism increased and led to his murder in the mosque he had built in Qazvīn (Jāmeʿ-e Ṣaḡīr) on 15 Ḏu’l-qaʿda 1263/25 October 1847, apparently the work of three Babis. The title _šahīd-e ṯāleṯ_ (the third martyr) was subsequently conferred on him, and his tomb remains prominent in Qazvīn.
