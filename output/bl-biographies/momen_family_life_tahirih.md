The family and early life of
Tahirih Qurrat al-‘Ayn
ĀāĪīŌōŪūḍḤḥṢṣṬṭẒẓ

Abstract
This paper is an attempt to bring together a large amount of information about the ancestry and
immediate family of the Babi heroine, poetess, and martyr, Tahirih Qurrat al-‘Ayn, that has become
available in Persian and Arabic, mainly in biographical dictionaries of Shi‘i religious scholars and
from family sources. Among the interesting points that emerge is the fact that Tahirih, whom the Babis
regarded as the return of Fatimih, the daughter of the prophet Muhammad, was also descended from
this lady on her mother’s side. The paper also tries to sketch out what these sources say about the
early life of Tahirih, her education, her marriage and her introduction to the teachings of Shaykh
Ahmad al-Ahsa’i, up to the time that she first heard of the Bab and became a Babi. The paper
describes some of the tensions in the paternal family of Tahirih, which must have affected her as she
grew up.

Tahirih Qurrat al-‘Ayn, the Babi heroine, poetess, and martyr, has become something of a legendary
figure – both among Iranian women who regard her as one of the initiators of the women’s movement
in Iran1 and among Baha’is who see her as a proto-Baha’i role model for women.2 This paper, written
partly to commemorate the 150th anniversary of her death, seeks not to add to the legend but rather to
bring to the fore a certain amount of historical material that is not currently part of the historical
picture that we have of Tahirih, thus serving to bring into sharper focus the picture that we have of
her.3 This new material is mainly material derived from the descendants of Tahirih’s family who have
in recent years either directly or indirectly published a certain amount of new information about the
family and early life of Tahirih, in biographical dictionaries of Shi‘i scholars and other places.4 This

new information is both complementary, in the sense of confirming from different sources, and
supplementary, in the sense of adding new facts, to some of the information previously published in
Persian in Nosratollah Mohammadhoseini’s Persian biography of Tahirih, which is the most
comprehensive account yet written of her.5

In the course of this paper, mention will be made of two rival schools of law in Shi‘ism, the
Usulis and the Akhbaris. Briefly, the Akhbaris maintained that rulings on religious law could only be
made on the basis of the Qur’an and the Traditions of the Imams, while the Usulis widened the bases
of religious law by maintaining that rulings could also be given based on the principles of consensus
and on the application of reason. During the late Safavid period (approximately the 17th century), the
Akhbaris had predominated, but towards the end of the period between the fall of the Safavids in 1722
and the rise of the Qajar dynasty in 1794, the Usulis, under Shaykh Muhammad Baqir ‘Vahid’
Bihbihani (1706–92), had triumphed in the shrine cities of Iraq (Najaf and Karbala) and were
prevailing in most Iranian cities – this school is followed by the majority of Shi‘is today. The third
movement that will be mentioned is the Shaykhi movement, based on the teachings of Shaykh Ahmad
al-Ahsa’i (1753–1826), which was to become an important foundation for the movement of the Bab
(1819–50). The Shaykhi movement was, at the time that Tahirih lived, only just emerging as a
separate movement. There is evidence that, at least in some cities, many Akhbaris became Shaykhis,
as this new movement spread throughout Iran.

The Safavids forced Shi‘ism upon the people of Persia. Most of the ‘ulama of Iran were Sunni at
the start of the Safavid period and so the Safavid kings were compelled to bring Shi‘i ‘ulama from
Lebanon and elsewhere to teach the people Shi‘ism. Qazvin was one of the most important cities of
Iran during the Safavid period, especially during the first half of this period when it was the capital of
the empire. As the Safavid era progressed, a new generation of Iranian Shi‘i ‘ulama began to emerge
and Qazvin was one of the cities to which they were attracted. Tahirih’s ancestors, on both her
mother’s and father’s side, were among those families of ‘ulama who migrated to Qazvin during
Safavid times.

Tahirih’s maternal family
Aminih Khanum, the mother of Tahirih, was descended from some of the leading families of Qazvin.
Her mother, Fatimih, was a member of a distinguished Qazvin family of Sayyids (descendants of the
Prophet Muhammad) and ‘ulama. They trace their ancestors to the Imam Husayn and from him to
Fatimih, the Prophet Muhammad’s daughter, and Imam ‘Ali, and hence to the Prophet Muhammad
himself. Thus it is of some interest that Tahirih, whom the Babis regard as the return of Fatimih, the
Prophet’s daughter, was descended through her mother and grandmother from Fatimih herself. This
family of Qazvin Sayyids appears to have originally resided in Tabriz. Amir Muhammad Ma‘sum
Husayni Qazvini (1007–1091 AH/1598–1680 AD), son of Amir Muhammad Fasih, grandson of Amir
Awliya and great-grandson of Sayyid Safi’u’d-Din, moved as a child with his father to Qazvin, where
he lived as a religious scholar during the second half of the Safavid era.6 His son, Sayyid Amir
Ibrahim was a student of Mulla Muhammad Baqir Majlisi, the foremost scholar of the end of the
Safavid period. Sayyid Amir Ibrahim lived for about 80 years and died in about 1149 AH/1736 AD.

\[36\] THE FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE OF TAHIRIH QURRAT AL-‘AYN

He was a scholar and poet and some 14 works of his are known. 7 He had five sons, the youngest of
which was Sayyid Husayn Qazvini, the great-grandfather of Tahirih, about whom it was written: ‘his
knowledge was not confined to jurisprudence but he had perfected many skills’. He was a teacher of
Sayyid Muhammad Mahdi Bahr al-‘Ulum (d. 1212/1797, who went on to become one of the foremost
‘ulama of his age) and his biographer lists some 26 works of his. He died in Qazvin in 1208/1793.8
The family were Usulis and opposed the Akhbaris.9

Sayyid Husayn Qazvini’s daughter, Fatimih, the grand-mother of Tahirih, was born in Qazvin in
1172/1756. She studied under her father and her uncle Sayyid Hasan. When she grew up she married
Shaykh Muhammad ‘Ali and she continued her studies under him. She memorized the Qur’an as well
as studying commentaries upon it. She also studied the Islamic Traditions and religious jurisprudence.
She is stated to have excelled in all of these. She is also said to have had a voice that carried well and
she was known for the lectures she gave from the pulpit. Many of the women of the town gathered
around her and listened to her classes. She died in 1260/1844.10

Aminih’s father was Shaykh Muhammad ‘Ali Qazvini. Shaykh Muhammad ‘Ali could trace his
ancestry back to a long line of ‘ulama of Qazvin. Rafi’ud-Din Muhammad, the son of Fathullah, was
the author of a book Abwāb al-Janān and died in 1089/1678.11 His son was Muhammad Shafi‘ who
completed his father’s book. The latter’s son, Mulla Muhammad Yahya Qazvini, wrote a work called
Tarjumān al-Lughat, translating into Persian and explaining the famous Arabic dictionary al-Qāmūs
of al-Firuzabadi for the Safavid king, Sultan Husayn – a work that took over two years and was
completed in 1705 and later published in 1273/1856.12 His grave became a shrine in Qazvin.13 The
latter’s son, Mulla ‘Abdu’l-Karim (d. 1134/1721) was also among the ‘ulama of Qazvin and wrote
several works explaining the terminology of the sermons and letters of Imam ‘Ali.14 One of Mulla
‘Abdu’l-Karim’s sons, Shaykh Muhammad ‘Ali, was the grandfather of Tahirih. Shaykh Muhammad
‘Ali was one of the ‘ulama of Qazvin.

The paternal family of Tahirih
The paternal family of Tahirih claim descent from the Buyids, an Iranian Shi‘i dynasty from
Mazandaran who, in the 10th and 11th centuries, were among the first to challenge successfully the
dominance of the ‘Abbasid caliphate and to establish a fiefdom throughout Iran and Iraq. In later
times, however, the ancestors of Tahirih settled in the rural area known as Talaqan, 15 a cluster of some

78 villages situated along the valley of the Shahrud River and its tributaries to the east of Qazvin – the
river eventually becomes the Sifidrud River and flows into the Caspian. Hamd Allah Mustawfi, a
14th-century writer from Qazvin, states in the Nuzhat al-Qulūb that the inhabitants of Talaqan at that
time although outwardly appearing to be Sunni were secretly inclined towards the Isma‘ili sect of
Shi‘ism16 (the Isma‘ili stronghold of Alamut had been close by before it was destroyed by the
Mongols). The area, along with most of the rest of Iran, came to adhere to Twelver Shi‘ism under
pressure from the Safavid dynasty in the 16th and 17th centuries.

It is during the latter part of the Safavid era that we find the first of Tahirih’s known paternal
ancestors. Shaykh Muhammad Kazim Talaqani (henceforward referred to as Shaykh Kazim) was a
cleric who was educated in Isfahan under some of the leading Shi‘i ‘ulama of his age: Shaykh-i
Baha’i, Mir Baqir Damad, and Mir Findiriski. From this list of teachers, we may assume that he was
somewhat interested in the school of mystical philosophy that was, at that time, reaching its peak in
Isfahan. Shaykh Kazim then established himself in Qazvin, the first of the family to migrate from
Talaqan to Qazvin. He built a madrasah (religious college) in Qazvin called the Madrasah-yi Navvab
(now called the Madrasah Imam as-Sadiq) and taught there. A contemporary of his, al-Hurr al-‘Amili,
considered him one of the great scholars of that age.17 He is known to have written a commentary on
the Qur’an. He died in Qazvin in about 1683.18

Shaykh Kazim’s son, Shaykh Muhammad Ja‘far Talaqani, known as Firishtih (angel), also
received his education from the leading religious scholars of his time. He received a certificate of
completion of his education in the year following his father’s death from the great Shi‘i scholar
Muhammad Baqir Majlisi, the author of the Bihār al-Anwār. Among other writings, he wrote a work
on fiqh (religious jurisprudence) and is the first of the family to be called an Usuli. He died in
1133/1720 just at the end of the Safavid era and was buried in Talaqan.19

Shaykh Muhammad Taqi Talaqani, the son of Shaykh Muhammad Ja‘far, studied philosophy
(ḥikmat) and theology (kalām) under Mirza Hasan Lahiji in Qumm, and then went on to Iraq, where
he studied at Najaf, Karbala and Kazimayn. He was present in Najaf when Nadir Shah held a meeting
there to try to reconcile Sunnism and Shi‘ism. He died in 1161/1748.20

Shaykh Muhammad Taqi had three sons and at least one daughter: one son was named
Muhammad Ja‘far after his grandfather, about whom little is known (but a son of his, Mulla Aqa
Hikami, taught philosophy to Tahirih); one son was named Muhammad Na‘im and was known as
Mulla Na‘ima (d. 1180/1766), who specialized in philosophy and mystical philosophy (a grandson of
this man, Mulla Yusif Hakami, also taught philosophy to Tahirih); a third son was named Shaykh
Muhammad, who was known as Mala’ikah (angels). This last named was the grandfather of Tahirih.
He studied under Mulla Isma‘il Khaju’i (d. 1173/1760) in Isfahan during the turbulent years after the
Afghan invasion had ended the Safavid dynasty. He is stated to have gained his title Mala’ikah on
account of his extreme piety.21 Mah Sharaf Khanum, a sister of these three brothers, after studying at
Isfahan and the shrine cities, was taken into Fath-‘Ali Shah’s household to act as secretary, on account
of her excellent composition and calligraphy. According to one account she assisted in particular with

the correspondence with the ‘ulama,22 according to another account she was the personal secretary of
Tāj as-Salṭanih, a wife of Fatḥ-‘Alī Shah.23

Shaykh Muhammad Mala’ikah was, by the middle of the 18th century, established as the leading
Usuli cleric in Qazvin. He was not, however, in a very strong situation since the town of Qazvin had
since the time of his great grandfather, Shaykh Muhammad Kazim, been dominated by the rival
Akhbari school of jurisprudence. Sometime in about 1750, the great Akhbari scholar, Shaykh Yusif
Bahrani, passed through Qazvin. The ‘ulama of the town took the opportunity to stage a debate
between him and Mala’ikah. After the debate, an angry Akhbari mob ransacked Mala’ikah’s house
and burned his library. In an attempt to quell the disturbances in the town, government officials forced
Mala’ikah to remove himself from the town. He chose to go into exile to the village of Baraghan,
about midway between Qazvin and Tehran and some miles north of the road between these two cities.
It was as a result of this exile that the family became known as Baraghani.

We have very little information about the wife of Mala’ikah, except that her name was Fatimih. 24

The couple had had some children while they were living in Qazvin, but it was winter when they were
forced to leave the city and their children died from the cold on their way to Baraghan.25 Once in
Baraghan, Mala’ikah and Fatimih had three more children, all sons (see below). Mala’ikah remained
in Baraghan for the remainder of his life and died in 1200/1785.

The maternal uncles of Tahirih
The maternal grandparents of Tahirih, Shaykh Muhammad ‘Ali and Fatimih, had four sons and at
least two daughters. The most well known of their sons was Mulla ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab Sharif Qazvini.
The designation ‘Sharif’ after his name indicates that his mother was a descendant of the Prophet
Muhammad. He studied in Karbala, Najaf and Kazimayn and is said to have received certificates of
completion of studies from more than 40 of the most learned scholars of his time. He is described as
one of the most learned of the ‘ulama of his age and some 30 of his works are known.26 Although all
of his main teachers were Usulis, he went somewhat away from the main Usuli school and in some of
his books takes up an Ahkbari position.27 He was put in charge of the Masjid Shah (the Shah Mosque),
the second most important mosque of Qazvin by Muhammad Shah. He was a pious man and tended to
be abstentious, using his wealth to make benefactions throughout the city of Qazvin, including four
cisterns for public use.28

MOOJAN MOMEN

In 1230/1814, Mulla ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab travelled with his brother-in-law Mulla Salih, Tahirih’s
father, on pilgrimage to Mecca. After completing the pilgrimage he travelled on to Cairo, where he
studied at the al-Azhar, the foremost religious college of the Sunni world, and obtained a certificate
from some of the ‘ulama of the Shafi‘i school of jurisprudence. As we shall see presently, Mulla
‘Abdu’l-Wahhab became a Shaykhi and eventually even a Babi. He had at least three sons: Mirza
Muhammad ‘Ali and Mirza Muhammad Hadi, who were both Shaykhis and became Babis and Letters
of the Living, and Mirza Yusif, who may have also become a Babi.

The brothers of Mulla ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab were Haji Rida (who built a caravanserai called after
him) and Mulla ‘Abdu’l-Karim, known as Haji Aqa or Haj Karim (who built some baths which were
named Hamam Haj Karim), who were both merchants, and Mulla ‘Ali Mardan, who was also a cleric.
Manuscripts of the writings of Mulla ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab exist in the handwriting of the latter two
brothers.29 One sister of these brothers was Aminih, Tahirih’s mother. We know that there was at least
one other sister, since the son of that sister, Mulla Javad Vilyani, played a role in Tahirih’s story and
in Babi history (see below).

The paternal uncles of Tahirih
Tahirih’s father, Mulla Salih, was the middle of three brothers. The eldest was Shaykh Mulla
Muhammad Taqi, known as Mulla Taqi, and was born in about 1166/1752;30 the middle brother was
Shaykh Mulla Muhammad Salih, who was known as Mulla Salih and was Tahirih’s father (born in
1167/1753);31 and the third brother was Shaykh Mulla Muhammad ‘Ali, who was called Mulla ‘Ali
and was born in 1175/1761.32 All three brothers were initially taught by their father in Baraghan and
then went to Qazvin and Isfahan, where they studied philosophy and mystical philosophy under such
scholars as Mulla ‘Ali Nuri (d. 1246). They then went on to the shrine cities of Iraq where Vahid
Bihbahani (see above) was in the process of completing the Usuli victory over the Akhbari school,
and thereby setting the scene for all developments in Twelver Shi‘ism up to the present day. The
brothers studied under Bihbahani and under such figures as Sayyid Muhammad Mahdi Bahr al-‘Ulum
(d. 1212/1797), Shaykh Ja‘far Kashif al-Ghita (d. 1228/1813) and his son Shaykh Hasan (1201/1786–
1262/1846) and Sayyid ‘Ali al-Tabataba’i (d. 1231/1816), who were the senior students of
Bihbihani.33

After the completion of their studies, the brothers came to Tehran to establish themselves there.

After a short period of time in Tehran, the brothers entered into a heated dispute with Mulla
Muhammad ‘Ali Jangali at the court of Fath-‘Ali Shah and were exiled to Iraq. When Shaykh Hasan
Kashif al-Ghita, a leading scholar who had been one of the teachers of the three brothers, went on a
trip to Iran, they accompanied him. Shaykh Hasan interceded with the Shah on behalf of the three

brothers and gained royal assent to their remaining in Iran, provided they did not remain in Tehran. So
they chose to settle in Qazvin, where they soon established themselves among the senior ‘ulama of the
city. They settled in the western part of the city, the Dimaj and Qumlaq quarters, which were
predominantly Turkish-speaking. Here the two older brothers built mosques for themselves (Mulla
Taqi in the Dimaj quarter). They themselves or their children married into the other leading families
of ‘ulama in the city.

Mulla Taqi was the most political of the three brothers, gaining a position of influence for himself
in the city and, at the same time, accumulating a great deal of wealth. He indulged in a number of
questionable activities and practices that even gave rise to claims that he was taking bribes.34 He
considered himself one of the leading mujtahids of the Shi‘i world and had had several disputes with
some of the leading scholars of his time such as Mirza-yi Qummi and Mulla Ahmad Naraqi.35

Mulla Taqi had several wives including a daughter of Fath-‘Ali Shah.36 He had ten sons and the
name of at least one daughter is known. Of these sons, the oldest was Mulla Muhammad, who married
Tahirih and was later Imam-Jum‘ih of Qazvin (for their children, see below). Tahirih was not his only
wife, however. He also married into the Taqavi family of ‘ulama of Qazvin and had a son, Mirza
Husayn, who was later elected to the Majlis (Iranian Parliament) as deputy for Qazvin. 37 When Mulla
Muhammad died, his position as Imam-Jum‘ih was inherited by Mulla Taqi’s second son, Shaykh
‘Abdu’llah. The other sons of Mulla Taqi were Shaykh Baqir, Shaykh Hasan, Shaykh Kazim, then the
sixth son, Shaykh Muhammad Ja‘far (1222/1807–1311/1893) who became a Shaykhi and married one
of Tahirih’s sisters. The seventh son was Shaykh Sadiq (1222/1807–1311/1893), who succeeded to
religious leadership in Qazvin,38 and the eighth son, Shaykh Abu’l-Qasim, married another of
Tahirih’s sisters. The last two sons were Shaykh Mahmud and Shaykh ‘Isa.39 The only daughter of
Mulla Taqi of whom we know is Umm Kulthum (c. 1224/1809–after 1268/1851) who married the
oldest surviving son of Mulla Salih, Mirza ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab.40

The youngest of the three Baraghani brothers, Mulla ‘Ali, was very different from his eldest
brother. He was more inclined towards mysticism and asceticism. During his days as a student, he
used to weep at nights and put chains around his neck.41 It is even stated in some sources that he
rejected the Usuli school championed by his brothers and leaned towards the Akhbaris.42 Once in
Qazvin, he contented himself with teaching mystical philosophy at his brother’s religious college, the
Salihiyyih. He eventually became, as we shall see, a Shaykhi and a Babi. Some 30 works of his are
known.43 The exact number of his children is not known but he had at least one daughter Fatimih (d.

Husayn, who married Fatimih, a daughter of Mulla Salih.45

Tahirih’s mother and father
Tahirih’s mother, Aminih (Āminih), was born in Qazvin in 1202/1787. She was educated by her
mother and father, and also by her brother Mulla ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab. She was about 17 when she was
married to Mulla Salih Baraghani in about 1219/1804. She was not his first wife as he had several
sons whose dates of birth precedes his marriage to Aminih. She continued her studies in the women’s
section of her husband’s religious college, the Salihiyyih, learning religious jurisprudence from her
husband and his brother, and philosophy and mystical philosophy from her husband’s cousin, Mulla
Aqa Hakami. She was very pious and abstemious and had memorized the Qur’an. Later she taught in
the women’s section of the Salihiyyih, becoming an authority on religious matters for the women of
Qazvin and leading prayers for women in the Salihiyyih. She was also a poet and among her writings
is a poem (qaṣidah) of some 480 lines relating the story of Zaynab, the daughter of the Imam Husayn,
from the time of her arrival in Karbala and her father’s martyrdom there, to her being taken in
captivity to Damascus and Medina. There also exists some of her correspondence with Sayyid
Mahmud al-Alusi, the Mufti of Baghdad, during the time when her daughter, Tahirih, was confined in
his house.46

Tahirih’s father, Mulla Salih, after he had completed his studies in the shrine cities of Iraq, settled
in Tehran and gathered around himself a circle of students. He and his brothers, however, fell out with
Fath-‘Ali Shah who ordered their expulsion from Iran to Iraq. From there, Mulla Salih went on
pilgrimage to Mecca and he remained in Medina for two years teaching Shi‘i jurisprudence. He then
returned to Najaf in Iraq and settled there teaching and gaining a reputation as a scholar. We have seen
above how the brothers came to return to Iran and settle in Qazvin.

In Qazvin, Mulla Salih occupied himself with religious scholarship and teaching. He built, in
1233/1817, a large religious college (madrassih), Madrassih-yi Salihiyyih in the Qumlaq quarter of
the town, where he taught religious jurisprudence. It grew into a very large institution with,
reportedly, 700 students at its peak, coming from all of the surrounding parts of Iran, and even from
India. His oldest surviving son Mirza ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab (not to be confused with Tahirih’s maternal
uncle) also taught religious jurisprudence there; Mulla Aqa Hakami (d. 1285/1868) and Mulla Yusif
Hakami (d. 1276/1859), respectively a cousin and the son of another cousin of Mulla Salih, taught
peripatetic and mystical philosophy; Mir Rafi‘ Talaqani and his son, Sayyid Hibatu’llah Rafi‘i, taught
medicine; Shaykh Muhammad Baqir Ashtiyani taught logic; Shaykh ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab Bihishti and
others also taught there. Perhaps the most famous person who attended this college, in later years, as a
student was Sayyid Jamalu’d-Din Asadabadi ‘Afghani’.47 Interestingly, Mulla Salih was sufficiently
concerned about women’s education to build a women’s section of the Salihiyyih. All of the women
of the family as well as other women from Qazvin studied there.

Mulla Salih was a meticulous scholar. His most important works are 5 commentaries on the
Qur’an that he wrote, amounting to some 55 volumes in all. He also wrote an important book on
religious jurisprudence in 14 volumes, which is still in print at the present time, and some 48 other
works.48

\[42\] THE FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE OF TAHIRIH QURRAT AL-‘AYN

The brothers and sisters of Tahirih
Mulla Salih had eight sons and at least seven daughters. Since Babi and Baha’i sources say that
Tahirih had only one sister and one brother, this may indicate that these were the children of Aminih
Khanum and the rest were from other wives. The sisters of Tahirih may be listed thus:

(1) Mardiyyih Khanum (1233/1817–c.1313/1895). She is the only sibling known to be a full sister of
Tahirih. She studied under her mother, her sister Tahirih, her father and both of her uncles, as well as
her father’s cousin, Mulla Aqa Hakami. She was married to Mirza Muhammad ‘Ali, the oldest son of
her maternal uncle, Mulla ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab. Like her sister and her husband, she first became a
Shaykhi and then, when they became Babis and Letters of the Living, she also became a Babi. She
accompanied her sister to Iraq and was confined with her in the house of Sayyid Mahmud Alusi, the
Mufti of Baghdad. When her husband died in the Shaykh Tabarsi upheaval, she married his brother
Mirza Yusif. She left several works including some poetry. She had one daughter.49

(2) Nargis Khanum (1240/1824–1322/1904). She studied under Tahirih, her brother, Mirza ‘Abdu’l-
Wahhab, her father and both uncles, as well as her father’s cousin, Mulla Aqa Hakami. She married
Shaykh Muhammad Ja‘far, the son of Mulla Taqi and had two daughters, Khadijih and Sakinih. Both
she and her husband were Shaykhis and she lived out her last days in Karbala where she is buried
close to the tomb of Sayyid Kazim Rashti.50

(3) Zahra (1240/1824–1320/1902). She studied under Tahirih, her brother, Mirza ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab,
her father and both uncles, as well as her father’s cousin, Mulla Aqa Hakami. She married her cousin,
Mirza Abu’l-Qasim, son of Mulla Taqi and had two sons.51

(4) Fatimih (d. 1295/1878). She studied under Tahirih, her brother, Mirza ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab, her father
and both uncles, as well as her father’s cousin, Mulla Aqa Hakami. She married her cousin, Shaykh
‘Abdu’l-Husayn, the son of Mulla ‘Ali and had one son. She taught at the Salihiyyih and used to
discuss religious matters on equal terms with the men of the family. Women resorted to her for legal
judgements. She wrote several works.52

(5) Khadijih Sultan Khanum (d. 1321/1903). She studied under Tahirih, her father and both uncles, as
well as her father’s cousin, Mulla Aqa Hakami. She was married to Sayyid Mirza Mufid of the
Shaykhu’l-Islam family of Qazvin, who were descended from Muhaqqiq al-Karaki, the foremost Shi‘i
scholar of the early Safavid period. She had five sons. She must have been inclined to the Shaykhi
school because three of her sons, Mir Sayyid ‘Ali, known as Mirza Buzurg, Mirza Mansur and Sayyid
Mirza Mahmud became Shaykhis, while two were Usulis.53 Such was the dissension in the family that
Sayyid Mirza Mas‘ud expressed his displeasure at his Shaykhi sons in his will and specified that only
his Usuli sons should have control over his library which he left as a religious endowment (waqf).54
Mirza Buzurg did however succeed to the title of Shaykh al-Islam.55

(6) Rubabih Khanum (d. 1297/1879). She studied under Tahirih, her brother, Mirza ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab,
her father and both uncles, as well as her father’s cousin, Mulla Aqa Hakami. She married Mirza
Hibatu’llah Rafi‘i (d. 1320/1902),56 a physician who taught at the Salihiyyih. She was learned in
religious matters and used to debate with male religious scholars on equal terms. Women would resort
to her for legal judgements and she was known as the refuge of the poor.57

With regard to Tahirih’s brothers, they may be listed thus:

(1) Shaykh Muhammad. He was born in Karbala, studied under his father and older uncle and under
some of the prominent ‘ulama of Karbala such as Sayyid ‘Ali Tabataba’i. He was killed in 1825–6
during the attempt of the ‘ulama to raise a jihad (holy war) against the Russians.58

(2) Mirza ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab (d. January 1877). He studied under his father and older uncle and under
the leading ‘ulama of Najaf and Karbala. He specialized in philosophy and mystical philosophy, but
was also sufficiently expert in religious jurisprudence to be regarded as a mujtahid and to be able to
take his father’s place when he died. He composed poetry and was a good orator.59 Towards the end of
his life he moved to Tehran. There is an indication in Nabil that he came to believe in the Bab but
‘failed to demonstrate subsequently by his acts the sincerity of his belief’.60 His son Shaykh Aqa
Sadru’d-Din (d. 1337/1918) was also a prominent scholar, at first taking his father’s place as a
religious leader in Qazvin and a teacher at the Salihiyyah and later teaching at Karbala at the
Madrasah Hasan Khan.61

(3) Shaykh Hasan (d. 1281/1864). He studied under his father and older uncle and was one of the
senior students of Shaykh Murtada Ansari, the leading religious scholar of his age. He became a
mujtahid and settled at first in Karbala where he established himself as a teacher. Later he moved to
Mecca and Medina, where he taught Shi‘i religious jurisprudence in accordance with the four Sunni
schools of jurisprudence. He was opposed by the Sunni ‘ulama and was attacked one evening as he
was walking home and died as a result of a blow to the head. He was married to Fatimih, the daughter
of his uncle Mulla ‘Ali and had two sons who became prominent ‘ulama of Karbala, ‘Allamah al-
Ha’iri (1249/1833–1310/1892) and Mulla ‘Ali Naqi Ha’iri (1253/1837–1320/1911) and a daughter,
Sultan Khanum (d. c.1336/1917), who married Mirza Shafi‘ Shaykh al-Islam of Qazvin.62

(4) Shaykh Husayn (d. 1309/1891). He studied under his father and older uncle and under the most
important ‘ulama of Karbala and Najaf. He then returned to Qazvin and taught at the Salihiyyah. His
son was Shaykh ‘Ali Akbar.63

\[44\] THE FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE OF TAHIRIH QURRAT AL-‘AYN

(5) Mulla Shaykh Muhammad Rida (d. 1308/1890 in Karbala). He studied under his father and older
uncle and under the leading ‘ulama of Najaf and Karbala and became a mujtahid. He married a
daughter of Shaykh Murtada Ansari and established himself as one of the senior ‘ulama and teachers
in Karbala. He had a son, Mulla Muhammad Husayn, known as Shaykh Aqa (1262–1333)64 and a
daughter named Fatimih (1277–1345), known as Karbala’i Khanum. The latter first married her
cousin Mulla ‘Ali Naqi, the son of Shaykh Hasan. After his death, she married Shaykh ‘Isa, the
youngest son of Mulla Taqi Baraghani and moved to Qazvin with him, where she taught in the
Salihiyyih.65

(6) Shaykh Muhammad, known as Kashif al-Asrar (1240/1824–1294/1877). He studied under his
father and older uncle and under the leading ‘ulama of Najaf and Karbala and became a mujtahid. 66

(7) Shaykh Musa (d. 1298/1880). He studied under his father and older uncle and under the leading
‘ulama of Najaf and Karbala. He then returned to Qazvin where he taught at the Salihiyyah. 67

(8) Shaykh Muhammad ‘Ali (d. 1315/1897). He studied under his father and older brothers and then
under the leading ‘ulama of Najaf and Karbala. He returned to Qazvin and taught at the Salihiyyah. In
his later years, he became the leading religious authority in Qazvin. He was a fellow-student of Sayyid
Jamalu’d-Din ‘Afghani’ at the Salihiyyah and a close friend of his. He joined him for a time in India.68

Tahirih’s early life
Some sources, including ‘Abdu’l-Baha, state that the name of the eldest daughter of Aminih Khanum
and Mulla Salih was Umm Salmih.69 This was the name of one of the heroines of early Islamic history
who had been one of the first women to believe in Muhammad and had been sent by him to Ethiopia
when the persecutions in Mecca were at their height. Because of her loving care for all of the Muslims
she was given the title ‘Mother of the Believers’ and much later, when her husband died, Muhammad
himself married her as a way of honouring her. Other sources, including Shoghi Effendi, state that her
name was Fatimih.70 Fadil Mazandarani explains the discrepancy thus: that although she was named
Fatimih at birth after her father’s mother (in fact her mother’s mother was also named Fatimih), she
was not actually called this out of respect for her grandmother who would have been living in the
same house. She was therefore called Umm Salmih. Later, when her qualities became evident, she
began to be called Zarin-Taj (crown of gold). There is some doubt as to the date of her birth. Baha’i

sources give the date as 1233/1817,71 but ‘Ali al-Wardi, an Iraqi historian, gives 1814, based on
family sources.72

She would have been only 5 or 8 years old (according to which date of birth one accepts) when,
in 1822, Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsa’i came to Qazvin. Her maternal uncle, Mulla ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab, who,
as we have noted previously, had at first been inclined towards the Akhbari school had at some stage
become an ardent student and follower of the Shaykh and had invited him to the city. He arranged
accommodation for the Shaykh and his family and ceded to him his position as leader of prayers in
Shah Mosque of the city, as well as asking him to teach a small religious college that he had founded.
Apart from Mulla ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab, several other of Tahirih’s relatives became admirers and
followers of Shaykh Ahmad, including her mother Aminih and her younger paternal uncle Mulla ‘Ali,
who had also previously probably inclined towards the Akhbari school. However, Shaykh Ahmad’s
presence in the city challenged the predominance of Tahirih’s older paternal uncle, Mulla Taqi, and
threatened his income. So one day, when the Shaykh was paying a courtesy call on Mulla Taqi, the
latter took the opportunity to question the Shaykh about some of his teachings regarding resurrection.
After the Shaykh had explained that he considered that the resurrection would occur in a subtle
spiritual body and not in the physical body, Mulla Taqi declared that this view was contradictory to
Islam and began to denounce Shaykh Ahmad from the pulpit. The town was split between supporters
and opponents of Shaykh Ahmad. Tahirih’s family was similarly split. Her maternal family was
largely supportive of Shaykh Ahmad but her paternal family was split. Her youngest paternal uncle,
Mulla ‘Ali supported Shaykh Ahmad, her oldest uncle was his fiercest critic and was supported by
others on the paternal side, while her father remained neutral trying to mediate.

Eventually, Mulla Taqi arranged for a large conference of the ‘ulama of Qazvin to convene in his
house to discuss the Shaykh’s views. Shaykh Ahmad himself came, accompanied by his sons and
Mulla ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab. On the opposing side, Mulla Taqi had asked his relatives, the above-
mentioned Mulla Aqa Hakami and Mulla Yusif Hakami, who were experts in philosophy and mystical
philosophy, to attend. Mulla Salih and Mulla ‘Ali also attended. The discussion centred again around
Shaykh Ahmad’s views on resurrection and the same disagreements emerged. At the end of the
debate, Mulla Taqi issued a decree against Shaykh Ahmad of takfir – declaration that someone is an
unbeliever. Shaykh Ahmad’s position in Qazvin became untenable and he left. Although most
accounts seem to indicate that Shaykh Ahmad only passed through Qazvin, the evidence from these
biographical accounts indicates that he remained there for about two years; long enough, for example,
for Tahirih’s mother to obtain a certificate (ijāzih) from him.

Tahirih, who was only 7 or 10 years old when Shaykh Ahmad left Qazvin, was probably largely
unaware of all this as she grew up. But another event probably had a stronger impact upon her. In
1241–2/1825–6, the second Perso-Russian War occurred. The ‘ulama were to a large extent
responsible for this as they had pressured Fath-‘Ali Shah into war. One of the leading ‘ulama of
Karbala, Sayyid Muhammad Tabataba’i, marched into Qazvin on his way to confront the Shah and
insist on a jihad against the Russians. He had taught the Baraghanis in Karbala and now stayed in the
house of Mulla Salih. Several of the members of the Baraghani family joined him in his jihad.
Tahirih’s oldest half-brother, Shaykh Muhammad, was killed in this conflict.

As with the other children of the family, Tahirih began her studies at an early age in the religious
college founded by her father. She had lessons in literature and poetry from her mother and studied
religious jurisprudence, the principles of jurisprudence, the Islamic Traditions and the Qur’an and its

\[46\] THE FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE OF TAHIRIH QURRAT AL-‘AYN

commentary with her father, her paternal uncles, and her older brothers, Mirza ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab and
Shaykh Hasan. She studied philosophy (falsafa) and mystical philosophy (ḥikmat and ‘irfān) with her
paternal relatives Mulla Aqa Hakami and Mulla Yusif Hakami (see above).73 She memorized the
Qur’an and excelled in all of these subjects and reached a high level of studies in them. One Muslim
source describes her thus: ‘When she had finished her studies, she was a female paragon of knowledge
and virtues . . . She was famous for her eloquence in writing and speech (bi ‘l-faṣāhah wa al-balāghah
wa jamāl al-bayān), in both prose and poetry, in both Arabic and Persian . . . And Qurrat al-‘Ayn,
with all of her knowledge and virtues, was also a paragon of beauty.’74 Concerning the extraordinary
abilities of Tahirih, her older brother Mirza ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab is reported to have said: ‘We were all,
her brothers and cousins, fearful to speak in her presence, so much did her knowledge intimidate us,
and if we hazarded to put forward an opinion on a point of doctrine that was in dispute, she would
prove to us where we were going wrong in a manner so clear, precise and magisterial that we were
thrown into confusion and withdrew.’75

Since the Baraghani family lived in the Turkish-speaking quarters of Qazvin, Tahirih almost
certainly grew up speaking both Persian and Turkish. Indeed, an Azeri scholar, Azize Caferzade, cites
a poem of Tahirih which she says was composed in Turkish and is preserved in a library in the
Republic of Azerbaijan.76

At the age of 14, Tahirih was married to Mulla Muhammad (d. 1296/1878), the son of her older
uncle Mulla Taqi. Mulla Muhammad was eager to complete his education and so the couple left for
Iraq, where they remained for about 13 years. In Karbala, the family had a residence in the Khaymgah
quarter.77 We know that during the 13 years or so that Tahirih and her husband spent in Iraq, they
lived for most of the time in Karbala, but they also lived for a time in Najaf and went on pilgrimage to
Mecca. In about 1841, Tahirih and Mulla Muhammad returned to Qazvin. Tahirih began to teach at
the Salihiyyih and, as can be seen from the above notes, was responsible for teaching all of her sisters,
as well as her sons (see below) and others.

It appears that, after the departure of Shaykh Ahmad Ahsa’i, Mulla Taqi had managed to impose
his will upon the family and had silenced the supporters of the Shaykh, since, as Tahirih grew up and
acquired her education, no word of the teaching of Shaykh Ahmad reached her, despite the support for
these teachings by her mother and both her maternal uncle and younger paternal uncle. It is not clear
when exactly Tahirih first heard of the teachings of Shaykh Ahmad. Most sources are agreed that she
first heard of these in Qazvin.78 Some sources seem to indicate that Tahirih was already a follower of
Shaykh Ahmad when she went to Karbala after her marriage and that she attended the lectures of

78   The exception being Samandar (Tārīkh, pp. 344–45) who seems to indicate that Tahirih first studied the Shaykhi

teachings by attending the lectures of Sayyid Kazim.

Sayyid Kazim Rashti, the successor of Shaykh Ahmad there.79 This information differs from other
sources that state that Tahirih never met Sayyid Kazim; only arriving for the first time in Karbala
shortly after his death.80 Since there is little doubt that Tahirih did go to Iraq after her marriage (three
of her children were born in Iraq), it may be that Tahirih did not learn of the Shaykhi movement until
her return from Iraq in 1841.

Putting aside the question of when it occurred, the story of how Tahirih came across the teachings
of Shaykh Ahmad is told by ‘Abdu’l-Baha. He states that one day when she was visiting the house of
one of her maternal cousins, Mulla Javad Vilyani, who was also a follower of Shaykh Ahmad, she
happened upon a book of the Shaykh and started to read it. She became enamoured of these teachings
and had soon mastered their complexities, assisted no doubt by her mother and other relatives. At
some stage, Sayyid Kazim asked his followers to compose treatises in support of the teachings of
Shaykh Ahmad, Tahirih responded and sent him a treatise. When Sayyid Kazim read this treatise, he
wrote her a letter which began: ‘Yā Qurrat al-‘Aynī’ (‘O Consolation of My Eyes!’). From that time
forth, Tahirih became known as Qurrat al-‘Ayn, the name by which she is still most commonly known
among Iranians.

Among her siblings, several also became Shaykhis – followers of Shaykh Ahmad, no doubt
infected by Tahirih’s enthusiasm for the new teachings. Tahirih’s full sister Mardiyyih adopted the
teachings of Shaykh Ahmad as did her half-sister Nargis, who was married to a cousin, Mulla
Muhammad Ja‘far, a son of Mulla Taqi. Despite his father’s enmity towards Shaykh Ahmad, the latter
was also a Shaykhi. Another half-sister, Khadijih Sultan Khanum, was almost certainly also a
Shaykhi, since three of her five sons became Shaykhis. All of Tahirih’s maternal cousins were
probably Shaykhis, under the influence of Mulla ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab, in particular Mirza Muhammad
‘Ali, son of Mulla ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab and husband of Mardiyyih, and his brother Mirza Muhammad
Hadi. Another maternal cousin who was a Shaykhi was the above-mentioned Mulla Javad Vilyani.

Soon strains had appeared in Tahirih’s marriage since Mulla Muhammad was, like his father, a
strong opponent of the teachings of Shaykh Ahmad which Tahirih had espoused. Eventually, this
ended in divorce and Tahirih returned to her father’s house taking her children with her.81 Although
her father loved her greatly, he was angered by the fact that her new beliefs had led to her divorce and
so this led to some acrimonious exchanges between them.82 About two years after her return from
Karbala, in late 1843, Tahirih decided that she had to go to Karbala, where her beloved teacher,
Sayyid Kazim was. She returned her older two sons to their father and set off for Karbala with her
daughter and youngest son who was only about 2 years old.83 Accompanying her on this journey was
her sister Mardiyyih and her husband Mirza Muhammad ‘Ali, together with the latter’s brother, Mirza
Hadi. Another of those who accompanied Tahirih to Karbala at this time was Khayr an-Nisa
(1240/1824–1325/1907), the daughter of Shaykh Muhammad Ja‘far Shari‘atmadar Astarabadi and her
husband Shaykh Muhammad Taqi Kashani (d. 1321/1903). The former had been a student of Tahirih
at the Salihiyyih.84

\[48\] THE FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE OF TAHIRIH QURRAT AL-‘AYN

Tahirih arrived in Karbala in January 1844, a short time after the death of Sayyid Kazim Rashti.

She was invited by Sayyid Kazim’s widow to stay at the late Sayyid’s house. It is customary for the
Shi‘i religious leaders at the major teaching centres to have regular teaching sessions at a particular
place so that students would know where to go hear their lectures. After the customary 40 days of
mourning, Tahirih continued the private lectures that Sayyid Kazim used to give in his own house,
thus becoming in one sense his successor. She lectured to the men from behind a curtain. One source
states that she also continued Sayyid Kazim’s open lectures in the western side of the courtyard of the
Shrine of Imam Husayn and attracted over two thousand students.85 There were however, other
claimants to Sayyid Kazim’s successorship in Karbala and her bold lectures caused some degree of
tension in the Shaykhi community. Of course at this time, Mulla Husayn Bushru’i also returned from
his journey and retired to the mosque at Kufah with a number of the disciples and students of Sayyid
Kazim. After this, they set off for Iran and accepted the Bab’s claim in Shiraz. The Bab then accepted
Tahirih as one of the Letters of the Living – his earliest group of 18 disciples who were elevated to the
highest rank in the Bab’s religion.

Of Tahirih’s family, her sister, Mardiyyih became a Babi. Mardiyyih’s husband, Mirza
Muhammad ‘Ali, and his brother Mirza Hadi, who were cousins of Tahirih both became Letters of the
Living. In Qazvin, Tahirih’s maternal uncle, Mulla ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab, and her younger paternal uncle,
Mulla ‘Ali, who had both been Shaykhis now became Babis, as did Mulla Javad Vilyani, who had
introduced Tahirih to the teachings of Shaykh Ahmad. The latter was, however, later to betray the Bab
and join up with the Bab’s avowed enemy, the Shaykhi leader Haji Mulla Muhammad Karim Khan
Kirmani.86

Tahirih’s Children
Tahirih is said in Baha’i sources to have had three children, two boys and a girl,87 but it appears that
she in fact had four children. The first two were boys, born while she and her husband were in
Karbala, then a girl when they were in Najaf and finally a boy when they had returned to Qazvin.

(1) Shaykh Isma‘il (d. 1302/1884). He was born in Karbala. He is recorded as having studied under
his mother Tahirih and under his father, as well as under both of his grandfathers, Mulla Taqi and
Mulla Salih. He studied philosophy and mystical philosophy under his uncle Mirza ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab
Baraghani and under Mulla Aqa Hakami and Mulla Yusif Hakami. He then went to Najaf and studied
under the leading scholars of his time, Shaykh Hasan Kashif al-Ghita, Shaykh Murtada Ansari and
Sayyid Husayn Kuhkamari. He returned to Qazvin and was a religious authority there for a time
before moving to Tehran. He was a poet and a theologian and is described in a Shi‘i biographical
dictionary thus: ‘He had a high station in his piety, virtue, sanctity, and justice and he had a pleasing
manner in his oration and a convincing manner of exposition.’88 One of the daughters of this man,
named Ma‘sumih Khanum married a certain Haj Sayyid ‘Azizu’llah of Urumiyyih. They lived in
Tehran. Their son Sayyid Ni‘matu’llah (1273 Sh/1894–1343 Sh/1964) at first took the surname Mirat
and later Varta. He studied oriental philosophy under Mirza Baqir Khan Qavamu’l-Hukama Lahiji and
Mirza Abu’l-Hasan Jilvih, and Western philosophy and political science under Dr Davud Hamadani.

He encountered the Baha’i Faith and became a Baha’i. He was a poet and wrote more than 10,000
verses of poetry.89

(2) Shaykh Ibrahim (d. 1310/1892). He was born while Tahirih lived in Karbala. He studied
philosophy and mystical philosophy under his uncle Mirza ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab Baraghani and under
Mulla Aqa Hakami and then studied jurisprudence under the leading scholar of his time, Shaykh
Murtada Ansari. After this, he taught for a time in Karbala before returning to Qazvin and teaching
there. He is said to have been a skilled orator. He moved to Baraghan in later years and died there.90
He had a son named Shaykh Davud (d. c.1334/1915) who studied with the prominent scholars of
Najaf and then went to Samarra where he remained for 30 years studying under Mirza-yi Shirazi, the
cousin of the Bab who was the leading Shi‘i scholar of his time. He then returned to Baraghan and
was a religious leader there until his death.91

(3) Zaynih (1253/1837–1333/1914). Born in Najaf. She studied under her mother Tahirih, her father
and her maternal grandfather, Mulla Salih. She accompanied her mother on her travels. She was
married to one of the Afshar family in Qazvin and had both sons and daughters. She taught in the
womens’ section of the Salihiyyih, led prayers and was a religious authority for the women of
Qazvin.92

(4) Shaykh Ishaq (c.1258/1842–c.1307/1889). Born in Qazvin. He studied under his mother Tahirih
and under his father; he took lessons in philosophy and mystical philosophy under his uncle Mirza
‘Abdu’l-Wahhab Baraghani and under Mulla Aqa Hakami. He travelled to Iraq where he studied
under the leading scholars of his time, including Shaykh Murtada Ansari and Mirza-yi Shirazi. He
then returned to Qazvin where he was a religious authority in the city and also taught religious
sciences. He composed several works including some poetry.93

The after-effects of Tahirih’s life upon her family
We will not go into the rest of Tahirih’s life once she became a Babi as that would expand this article
into a book. However, we will look at what happened to her family after the advent of the Babi
movement. The assassination of Tahirih’s uncle Mulla Taqi by a Shaykhi on 15 Dhu al-Qa‘da
1263/25 October 184794 had a traumatic effect on her family. Tahirih was accused of complicity in the
murder of her uncle and her father Mulla Salih was forced to defend his daughter as well as his family
honour. In a meeting of the ‘ulama of Qazvin where his daughter’s reputation was being attacked, for
example, he spoke up in her defence only to be taunted by one of those present with the following
lines of doggerel verse: ‘No glory rests upon that house / where the cock’s crow comes from the
hens.’95 Tears were observed to flow from Mulla Salih’s eyes and he fell silent and left the meeting.

\[50\] THE FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE OF TAHIRIH QURRAT AL-‘AYN

Mulla Salih found it impossible to live on in Qazvin and departed for Karbala in early 1264/1848.96
He lived there until the end of his life, teaching and writing. He left behind in Karbala a valuable
library which exists up to the present.97 He died on 27 Jamadi II 1271/17 March 1872 while praying at
the head of the tomb of the Imam Husayn.98

The arrest of Tahirih and her confinement in the house of Mirza Mahmud Khan, the Kalantar
(mayor) of Tehran no doubt weighed heavily upon her mother Aminih, who died in 1851, shortly
before Tahirih’s own execution in 1852 (since all of the Shaykhi members of her family became
Babis, it is possible that she did also). Mulla ‘Ali, Tahirih’s uncle who had been both a Shaykhi and
later covertly a Babi, died in 1852. The pressure of these events also led Tahirih’s maternal uncle,
Mulla ‘Abdu’l-Wahhab, to leave Qazvin for Najaf. Here he died at the shrine of Imam ‘Ali in
1270/1853. Of Tahirih’s three maternal cousins whom we know had become Babis, Mirza
Muhammad ‘Ali, the husband of Tahirih’s sister Mardiyyih, had perished in the Shaykh Tabarsi
upheaval, his brother Mirza Hadi lived on in Qazvin but hid his beliefs, and later became a follower of
Azal, while Mulla Javad Vilyani had betrayed the Bab and had become a follower of Haji Mirza
Karim Khan Kirmani, the main Shaykhi opponent of the Bab. Tahirih's sister was a Babi but we do
not have information about her belief in later life.

Needless to say, the family of Tahirih had been split apart and heavily traumatized by the events
of these years. First, the split in the family caused by the Shaykhi teachings and then by the Bab’s
message. The murder of Mulla Taqi had been the culminating shock. In the following years, the
family of Tahirih tried to close ranks and expunge the memory of these events. In writing accounts of
their family, for example, they made no mention at all of Mulla ‘Ali’s adherence to the Shaykhi or
Babi movement, apart from listing Shaykh Ahmad al-Ahsa’i as one of his teachers. 99 Most of the
descendants of all three of the brothers, including the children of Tahirih herself, are accounted as
pious Usulis by the Shi‘i biographical sources.100

But the family has not been able to escape the growing fame of their troublesome ancestor
Tahirih. Therefore, in recent years, they have even attempted to maintain that Tahirih was not a Babi
at all – or that she repented of her heresy at the end of her life. 101 Thus for example, Zaynih, the
daughter of Tahirih, who accompanied her mother on her travels and was with her mother during her
imprisonment in the house of Mahmud Khan Kalantar in Tehran up to the time of her execution, is
stated to have maintained that her mother died a follower of Shi‘ism (‘ala madhhab ash-Shi‘a) and
that everything else was a false accusation against her by her enemies, the Shah and the Iranian
government, who eventually brought about her death.102 Her son, Shaykh Ibrahim, is said to have
stated that when he visited her during her confinement in Tehran, he found her fasting and spending
her time reading the Qur’an and praying, and he therefore asserts that she died a Muslim.103 Of course
such activities as reading the Qur’an, praying and fasting were commonplace among the Babis – the

99   Al-Ṣāliḥī, ‘Introduction’, pp. 19–20.
100 The family came to use surnames derived from the three brothers: Shahidi, descendants of Mulla Taqi, who became

> known after his murder as Shahid Thalith, the Third Martyr, following on from two medieval Shi‘i martyrs; Ṣaliḥi,
> descendants of Mulla Salih; and ‘Alawi, descendants of Mulla ‘Ali. Some of the latter two lines of descent also attached
> the name Shahidi to themselves in honour of Mulla Taqi and thus became Shahidi Ṣaliḥi and Shahidi ‘Alawi.
> Biographies of these descendants came be found in al-Amīn, Mustadrakāt A‘yān al-Shī‘a and Ṭihrānī, Ṭabaqāt A‘lām
> ash-Shī‘a (14th century).

101 A recent family genealogy, Yahya Shahidi, Shajarih–yi Khānivādih–hā, 2: 931–38, denies that Tahirih was ever a Babi.
102 Al-Amīn, Mustadrakāt A‘yān al-Shī‘a 6: 174, no. 273.
103 Al-Amīn, Mustadrakāt A‘yān al-Shī‘a 6: 243, no. 328.

Bab, for example, spent his time in prison praying and reading accounts of the martyrdom of the
Imam Husayn and other practices that would have numbered him as a pious Shi‘i. This was part of the
ethos of the Babi movement.

Conclusion
In this paper, an attempt has been made to redraw the picture that we have of Tahirih based on sources
other than the Baha’i histories that are available in English and, in particular, family sources. As well
as differences of facts, such as the date of birth of Tahirih and the number of brothers and sisters that
she had, there are some differences in the picture drawn here as compared to the one given up to now
in the Baha’i histories. For example, we see that although Tahirih was exceptional among the women
of Iran at that time in being educated, she was not exceptional in this regard within her own family. It
appears to have been the custom in the Baraghani family to educate girls as well as boys – of course
the high levels to which Tahirih attained were exceptional. Similarly, although standard Baha’i
histories depict her discovery of the teachings of Shaykh Ahmad as being a fortunate chance
occurrence in the home of a cousin, in fact, many members of Tahirih’s family were Shaykhis,
including her mother, one paternal uncle and all of her maternal uncles and cousins. Thus it seems
likely that she would have come across the Shaykhi teachings at some time from one of these sources.
Similarly, the account in the Baha’i histories of her making the decision to leave her children to go to
Karbala to meet Sayyid Kazim Rashti in 1843 may need to be altered in the light of the assertion that
at least her daughter accompanied her on this journey and it may be that her youngest son also did.

In all, however, the sources presented in this paper confirm and even bring out in stronger relief,
her towering intellectual abilities – a fact even acknowledged in accounts written by Shi‘i clerics
antagonistic to the Babi and Baha’i Faiths. Despite the efforts of her family to conceal the heresy of
their fiery and turbulent daughter – to ‘re-veil’ Tahirih and thus restore the family’s honour and
reputation for piety – the memory of her actions and her courage lives on. Indeed, it is ironic that but
for her, the family itself would now be insignificant among the masses of Shi‘i religious families.
