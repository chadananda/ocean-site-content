I

The Council of Bedesht1

Molla Saléh had, among his children a girl, Zarrine Tadj — the crown of gold — who called
attention to herself from earliest childhood. Instead of devoting herself to games and amusements like
her peers did, she spent hours listening to the theological discourses of her parents. Her lively
intelligence quickly assimilated all of Islamic science, without floundering, and soon she took part in
discussing the most obscure and esoteric points. The traditions [hadith] held no secrets for her. Her
reputation was quickly established in the town, and her fellow townsmen considered her a true
prodigy.

A prodigy in knowledge, but also a prodigy in beauty: for the child grew up and became a young
girl whose face gleamed with such radiant beauty that she was given the surname of Qourrèt-oul-Aïne
— which M. de Gobineau translates “Consolation of the Eyes.”

Her brother, Abd oul Vahhab Qasvini, who inherited the learning and reputation of his father, has
himself stated, even though he remained (in appearance at least) a Muslim: “All of us, her brothers, her
cousins, we did not dare to speak in her presence, so much did her knowledge intimidate us; and if we
hazarded to express an hypothesis on a contested point of doctrine, she demonstrated to us that we
were taking the wrong route in such a clear, precise, and peremptory fashion that we retired, all
confused.”

She attended the classes of her father and of her uncle in the same room as two or three hundred
students, but concealed behind a curtain; and more than once, she refuted the explanations that these
two elders proposed for this or that question.

Her reputation became immense among the learned of Persia and the highest ulama consented to
adopt some of her hypotheses and her opinions. This fact is even more remarkable inasmuch as the
Shiite Muslim religion has placed woman almost at the rank of the animal: she does not have a soul
and exists only for reproduction.

While still very young, she married the son of her uncle, Mohammed Qasvini, who was the Imam
Jomé [leader of the Friday prayers] of the town and, afterwards, she went to Kerbélah where she
assisted in the lessons of Seyyed Kazem Rechti. She shared the ideas of her teacher with passion, ideas
which she knew of previously, Qasvine having become a center for the Cheikhies [Shaykhí] doctrines.

She possessed, as we will see, an ardent temperament, a clear and lucid intelligence, a marvellous
composure, and an indomitable courage.

All these qualities together were to bring her to occupy herself with the Báb, whom she heard
about after her return to Qasvine. What she learned about him interested her so intensely that she
entered into correspondence with the Reformer and, soon convinced by him, she made her conversion
known to one and all. (1848)

The scandal was immense and the clergy were dismayed. In vain her husband, her father, and her
brothers counselled her to renounce this dangerous foolishness, but she remained inflexible and loudly
proclaimed her faith.

It is perfectly untrue that she, from this moment, rejected the usage of the veil and that she
appeared in assemblies with an uncovered face. So complete a rejection of all the most sacred laws
would have been promptly and severely punished. Prejudice is too strongly rooted in the spirit of the
Persians for her to have dared to do so, and it would have served no purpose. Furthermore, up until the
time of the council of Bedesht, the command for those who knew the secret thoughts of the Báb was to
announce that the promises contained in the Qoran were being realized, that the hidden Imam was
manifest, and that he was going to submit the whole world to the religion of Islam. It would have been
a singular aberration to act in contradiction to the laws which one announced as deemed to be so soon
triumphant.

These two reasons suffice to demonstrate the error which M. de Gobineau made. Furthermore, we
will soon see where and how Qourrèt-oul-Aïne appeared for the first time before a crowd with an
uncovered face.

In any case, the scandal went on, growing every day; and it was with a sigh of relief that her
family accepted the proposition she made to them that she return to Kerbélah. It was hoped on the one
hand that her absence would make her forget [her folly], and on the other that the majesty of the sacred
shrines would cause her to return to her senses. But it was in vain that she accomplished the
pilgrimage; for, in the midst of the illustrious tombs of the martyrs [of Shí’í Islam — the Imam ‘Alí

and the Imam Husayn], she remained as resolute a Bábí as she had been in Qasvine. So before her
attitudes caused some grave consequence in the very center of fanatical Shiism, her family believed
they must affect her return.

Hadji Mohammed Hammami was chosen for this mission, along with several servants from the
house. This is how he described his journey:

I arrived in Kerbélah and immediately went to see Qourrèt-oul-Aïne. I gave to her the
> letters that had been entrusted to me by her father, her husband, and her uncle. I begged
> her to obey the orders that they contained, and I ended up convincing her by my insistence.
> I prepared a conveyance for her, and we set off. Some Bábís accompanied her until we
> reached a forest of date palms which was close by, where they took leave of her.

I was very happy to have succeeded in my mission, and I thought only of the joy of
> returning. Suddenly, after having passed the said forest, I was joined by some riders who
> approached the conveyance, respectfully saluted Qourrèt-oul-Aïne, and took up escorting
> her.

When we arrived at the way station, it was they who installed her at a certain distance
from us and who devoted themselves to her service.

It was like this all through the journey. When we arrived in Qasvine, the riders
dispersed in all directions.

I conducted Qourrèt-oul-Aïne to the house of her father and told him what I had seen.

> Hadji Molla Taghi who was present at the meeting, showed himself to be very irritated,
> and ordered all the servants to prevent this woman from leaving the house under any
> circumstances, and to permit no one without an authorization expressly from himself, to
> visit her.

These orders given, he visited the traveler and hoped by persuasion to convince her of the error in
which she was engaged. He could not do so, and furious before her calm and conviction, he could not
restrain himself from cursing the Bab and showering him with insults.

Qourrèt-oul-Aïne looked him in the face then and said to him: “Alas for you, for I see your mouth
filled with blood.”

After that, she was closely watched and spent her days walking in what now became her prison,
singing psalms and sacred songs.

One night, armed men forced entry into the house. The prisoner received them, had them enter,
and delivered a sermon that lasted for more than two hours. When this became known, Hadji Molla
Taghi was informed. Giving free reign to his temper, he insulted his niece, and beat her.

Thereafter, excitement grew every day in the town. The Babis of Qasvine could not repress their
enthusiasm, and these signs of happiness further increased the fury of the Muslims. There was nothing
but heated debates, mutual insults, and the renewal of troubles without ceasing. Qourrèt-oul-Aïne,
always in correspondence with the Bab, had just received an order from him to go forth and evangelize
the provinces.

Seyyed Ali Mohammed was at this time imprisoned in [the fortress of] Makou. This precipitated
further events, for it became urgent to take counsel. The imprisonment of the Prophet could be the
prelude to a bloody end. Already in various places, isolated Babis had been massacred and persecution
was always menacing. If they did not take immediate and forceful measures, they risked seeing all this
agitation collapse as it was being born, and the new religion drowned in rivers of blood. And this very
religion, was it not now finally necessary to unveil it before the eyes of its followers, so they might
follow it without doubting what it was in reality and where it could lead them? Was it not necessary to
finally consider a means of removing the Bab from the painful and dangerous situation in which he
was found? All of these questions were the subject of an active correspondence among the various
Babi leaders, and it was precisely in order to find the solution that it was decided to convene a general
convocation, which we have called the Council of Bedesht.

It was therefore necessary that Qourrèt-oul-Aïne find a way to leave Qasvine. But before this she
had to punish the heretic who had dared, in her presence, to proffer a curse upon the Bab.

Molla Mohammed Taghi had a habit of going out before sunrise to say his morning prayers in the
mosque. There he saw nobody but the servants charged with the upkeep of the temple and two or three
beggars. That morning, he had just entered the mosque when an individual struck him in the mouth
with the blow of a lance, fulfilling thus the prediction which his niece had made. Five or six other
assassins threw themselves upon him and dispatched him with blows of saber and knife. This deed
accomplished, each left for his own place, leaving the victim where he fell.

The tumult was frightful in the town. This bold sacrilege made the hearts of all the Muslims
tremble. They solemnly proclaimed Molla Mohammed Taghi a martyr of the Islamic faith and loudly
called for the punishment of the guilty ones. The governor arrested all those whom he suspected of
being Babis, and he referred the matter immediately to Mohammed Chah. In the meantime, an Arab,
Cheikh Saleh, declared himself to be solely responsible for the assassination.

Qourrèt-oul-Aïne was closely watched, but the investigation was long, and one lovely night the
Babis came and took her away. She was mounted on a horse and the troop left the town through a
breach in the city walls. Naieb Quli, who afterwards became the agent of the shah, tells of this escape
thus:

I was among the servants who accompanied this woman. As soon as we had left the
> town, we abandoned the main road and followed that of Zah’ra of Qasvine. We arrived by
> traveling in this way at Enderman, near the Chahzadeh Abd Oul Azim. Having arrived

there, she gave me a letter and commanded that I carry it to Téhéran, to the house of
Mirza Bouzourg Nouri,2 where I was to give it to Mirza Housseïn Ali.3

I arrived in the town early in the morning and remitted my letter into the hands of its
> destined recipient. He ordered me to return to Endermane and to announce that he would
> arrive there himself in the afternoon. In fact, about five hours before sunset, Mirza
> Housseïn Ali, accompanied by some riders holding saddled horses by the reins, came to
> join us. Qourrèt-oul-Aïne retired to change clothes and mounted a horse whose bridle was
> made of gold. We each one of us mounted one of the horses that had been brought, and we
> set off, one hour before sunset. Two hours later, we were in the house of Mirza Housseïn
> Ali. We remained there for several days during which Qourrèt-oul-Aïne received numerous
> visitors.

About five days after our arrival, I was surprised to see that there was only one single
> servant left in the house. He served me tea and announced that a horse was saddled for me
> in the stable. He told me to go to Mesker Abad, near Sourkh Eçar. I arrived in this village
> before lunch, and I saw lots of people and numerous tents. Qourrèt-oul-Aïne summoned
> me, and asked me if I wanted to convert to Babism. Upon my refusal, she gave me several
> handfuls coins and said to me: “Tonight you are still my guest, but tomorrow morning you
> will leave for Téhéran.”

After dinner she left with her people, and the next morning I returned to the town with
> some servants who did not wish to follow her. I learned afterwards that she had gone to
> Khorassan.

This was, in fact, the route that she took to arrive at Bedesht where she found herself with Molla
Husseïn Bouchrouyéhi — the Bab el-Bab, Mirza Housseïn Ali, Qouddous and others, who had arrived
before her.

These persons discussed amongst themselves certain obscure points over which they were not in
accord. They chose as arbitrator the one who hads just arrived, who gave her responses in writing,
which all accepted.

The imprisonment of the Bab was the object of the first consultation. They agreed to organize a
pilgrimage to the mountain of Makou. Their missionaries were to spread out over the land, recruit as
many pilgrims as possible, and as soon as their troop was formed present themselves at the prison of
the Prophet. Even though no history says it, even though oral tradition is mute on this subject, it is
certain that — in the final analysis — this was to result in the liberation of the prisoner. I certainly
hope that it was decided in principle not to make recourse to violence, but I am convinced that this
mass of pilgrims would have waited for the outcome of events and, if the Government had decided
upon the death of the Bab, they would have opposed the execution of the sentence by force. Perhaps
they even had the idea that, in case too many troops should attack them, they could easily escape into
Russia.

Their action on behalf of the prisoner thus decided, the new doctrine was examined in all its
aspects. They were all unanimous on this point: that Seyyèd Ali Mohammed was a new prophet greater
than those who had preceded him and that, even as Jesus had abrogated the law of Moses, even as
Muhammad had abrogated that of Christ, the Bab had abrogated the Qoran, which [doctrine] was
represented by this formula — “God has manifested himself and the earlier religion is abrogated; the
old law is uprooted; we must disseminate the new among men.”

Qourrèt-oul-Aïne declared then that it was right and fair to inform the ignorant Babis of this
fundamental teaching.4 Qouddous observed that their followers were sincere Muslims, that their
natural fanaticism had been even more excited by their predictions, and that it was actually dangerous
to disillusion them.

Qourrèt-oul-Aïne replied that to postpone the explanations [of these teachings] until later would
only delay the inevitable; that furthermore the danger would only grow with the exaltation of their
fellows, and that it would be better — before a drop of blood be spilled — to be assured of the
conscious devotion of those who wished to follow them.

Would there be any? This was the heart of the question, and all besides Qourrèt-oul-Aïne were of
the view that, at the first words they would hear pronounced against the Qoran, their adherents would
be appalled by the blasphemy, and would cover them with maledictions and insults; and that might not
be the worst of it. They could not imagine without trembling the rage that would follow the shock [in
the hearts of] these unknowing Babis. Perhaps for the first time, they understood the responsibility they
had in having sought to attract human beings to such a terrible adventure without making them aware
of what they were engaged in.

Things were at great risk of turning out badly when Qourrèt-oul-Aïne thought of a strategy.

To understand this plan, one must know that the Shiite religion condemns every apostate [from the
religion of Islam] to death without remission. No excuse is accepted, and even if the transgressor
returns to Islam, he cannot stop or suspend the sentence pronounced against him by the law. But it is
not so for women. They are just reproducing animals; they are not responsible for their acts. Also, if
one of them happens to change religion, she cannot do so except unconsciously — one must then
reason with her, instruct her, make her understand her crime, and bring her back to Islam. Her return to
her original religion assures forgiveness for her mistake. Only if she persists in her deadly error, it is
then, and only then, that she merits death.

It was by stressing this distinction of Shi’i law that Qourrèt-oul-Aïne convinced her coreligionists
to attempt the adventure. “We will convene,” she said, “all those who have come here with us.
Qouddous will not attend the gathering. When our faithful ones have assembled, I will unveil all the
truth to them. I will make them understand the manifestation of God and the abrogation of the Qoran.
If these men accept, we will have attained our aim without difficulty; if on the contrary they are
scandalized and revolt, they will certainly go to inform the only one of their leaders who did not take
part in the meeting. Qouddous then will renounce me, will declare me an unbeliever, and will try to
make me return to Islam. This will take some days, during which we will have time to calm the

excitement and convince our people. If we are not successful, then I will appear to accept the
arguments of Qouddous, and I will pretend to return to the Qoran.”

After having maturely reflected upon this proposition, the leaders understood that it was the best
means to arrange things. As it was necessary to make this proclamation, it was better to make it
immediately and in a fashion that would not compromise them all.

All these dispositions having been taken and determined, the Babis were summoned to a sermon,
as was done every day in the camp. Everyone knew that Her Highness the Pure [Táhirih] was to speak.
Everyone came to the meeting except Qouddous, who found a way to make his absence and explained
it by an illness which obliged him to take to bed.

Qourrèt-oul-Aïne had, conforming to the usage she had adopted, caused a light piece of cloth to be
suspended from two cables like a curtain. It was always from behind this veil that she spoke. That day
she dressed in her most beautiful garments and her richest adornments. She ordered that her two
maidservants stand a little behind her, armed with scissors. At a sign that she would make, the two of
them together were to cut the cords holding the cloth, which would fall in a single motion.

She began forthwith her lecture: the adventure she had planned, the very natural emotion which
she felt, the hope of success, the fear of a failure excited her to such a point that never before had she
been so eloquent or so persuasive. The listeners, charmed by her voice and by her talent, listened to her
with profound attention — no one moved. At the moment when she pronounced these words: “You
must today all know that God has manifested himself and the Qoran is abrogated: a new book has
descended to us from heaven, a new law is given to us,” she made the agreed upon sign. The
maidservants obeyed her, the curtain fell, and resplendent she appeared to the eyes of her listeners. She
returned for one second to her maidservants as if to ask them to take account of what had happened,
and immediately she faced the crowd: “What does this accident matter?” she said. “This has no
importance — am I not your sister and are you not my brothers? And what sister has ever hidden her
face from her brother?”

But the effect produced was overwhelming. Some hid their faces with their hands, others
prostrated themselves, others enveloped their heads in their garments so as not to see the face of Her
Highness the Pure One. If looking at the face of an unknown woman who passes in the street is a
serious sin, what a crime was this for one's eyes to rest upon the saint that she was?

She tried to convince them, walking among them and calling them her brothers, telling them that
the Qoran being abrogated, and the law which ordained that women be veiled existed no longer. But
she could not succeed. Some, very few, looked at her. Mirza Husseïn Ali Beha, understanding that the
scene had lasted long enough and that it might turn towards the tragic, threw his overcoat, called an
aba, over the head of Qourrèt-oul-Aïne and conducted her to his tent.

The meeting ended in the midst of an indescribable tumult. Insults poured down upon a woman so
indecent as to show herself in this way, with an uncovered face. Some said that she had suddenly gone
mad, others that it was a provocation, others — very few — took her defense. The discussion

intensified to the point of violence, and in the end it was decided to go inform Qouddous of the scandal
which had just happened. Only those who had defended her installed themselves around the tent of Her
Highness Tahéré.

Qouddous received the malcontents and had them describe the affair in minutest detail. He could
thus see for himself the horror that was inspired in these fanatical Muslims by the act of Qourrèt-oul-
Aïne. Not wishing to deflate the emotions which had exploded with such force, and thinking to reserve
this in the future, he declared: “The fact in itself is incomprehensible and confuses me. If in acting and
in speaking as she has Her Highness Tahéré has really expressed her conviction, she is an unbeliever
and you must hereafter consider her such. But perhaps there is in all of this a hidden significance.”

As the speaker had hoped, these last words fully preoccupied the imagination of those who had
heard them. They sought with passion the inner purpose, the mysterious significance [of these events],
and from then on, a basis for discussion was found.

Every day Qouddous drove deeper into the spirit of his adherents the doubt which he had so deftly
seeded. “Certainly,” he said, “the veil is more a custom than a law; the wives of the Prophet did not
veil themselves except after an Arab had the impudence to wish to buy Aïcha from Muhammad, and
one can think that the commands of the Qoran concern only these sacred wives. But this custom is
venerable in its antiquity and, furthermore, protects the modesty of our wives and the sanctity of the
family. Certainly, if the contrary usage established itself, men would get used to it very quickly and,
from thereon, they would respect those with whom it is forbidden for them to have commerce. This
might even improve the debauched customs of our large cities. But how dare anyone say that the
Qoran is abrogated and wish to substitute a new law? The Mahdi must explain all that is obscure in the
Divine Book, but he must amplify it, not destroy it. Qourrèt-oul-Aïne is a heretic.”

Having thus reconciled them to so unexpected an act of Qourrèt-oul-Aïne, he deftly insisted on the
obscurities and the inconsequentialities of the Qoran, all the while renewing every day her
excommunication. When he thought he had sufficiently prepared them, he informed his associates to
attempt a final test.

Qourrèt-oul-Aïne did not remain inactive. When she was informed of the excommunication
pronounced against her, she assembled those who had remained faithful to her, whose number had
increased since the earliest days. She explained to them the new doctrine, demonstrated to them the
divinity of the Bab, and excommunicated in his turn Qouddous and his adherents. Her unmatched
talent won over the conviction of those whom the marvelous beauty of her face did not predispose
altogether in her favor. When Qouddous let her know that the hour had come to try a last assault, she
asked for two men who were ready to die. Two young men presented themselves, and she gave them
her instructions.

They went to the enemy camp and arrived there at the moment when Qouddous made his daily
address. They interrupted him and shouted: “Her Highness the Pure reproaches you for saying bad
things about her without daring to debate her in person. She thus challenges you to come into our camp
and to dispute with her according to reason and true arguments, and this publicly. That if you triumph

over her, she will acknowledge this and will obey you; if, on the contrary, it is she who triumphs over
you, it will be for you to incline yourself towards her and to submit.”

“No,” said Qouddous, “This woman has apostatized her religion: I want neither to see her, nor to
speak with her.”

“Certainly,” they replied, “we will not bring back a response so offensive to her. Therefore, here
are the three alternatives that she has left us: either we must bring you to her willingly; or, if you
refuse, bring her your head; or, if we do not succeed, ourselves be killed in seeking to succeed in this.
These are the orders which we have received, and we are here to execute them. So then, choose: Come,
be killed, or kill us.”

Qouddous turned towards his companions and said to them: “It is you that must reply: if you say
to me kill, I will kill; if you say die, I will die; if you say go, I will go.”

There was a lively discussion, but the decision was not long in coming; it was formulated thus:
“Go find Qourrèt-oul-Aïne and speak with her; it is better than killing or being killed.”

Qouddous then arose and, followed by all his people, went to the camp of Tahéré. When all the
people had taken their places, our heroine came to sit opposite her adversary and the discussion
immediately began. By deft citations from the Qoran and the hadith, she successfully demonstrated
what the task of the hidden Imam was to be: that he was charged with speaking all the divine truths
ordained in the name of God, and that before the grandeur of this role the stations of all the prophets
gone before, including Muhammad, were completely effaced.

Defeated, Qouddous arose and proclaimed loudly: “That which she says is the Truth, and what she
did it well done.” He then turned towards her and asked her forgiveness for his errors and his
blasphemies. All his people imitated him, and the new religion was thus founded in the midst of
universal enthusiasm and happiness.

After some days given to joy and mutual congratulations, the leaders separated in order to search
for pilgrims [willing to go to Mákú]. Mollah Houssein Buchrouyehi retraced his way towards the
interior of Khorassan. Qouddous directed himself towards Mazanderan. And Qourrèt-oul-Aïne, after
having been escorted for some days by the apostle of Mazanderan [Bahá’u’lláh], separated from him
and seems to have directed herself to Qasvine, passing of course through Nour [Bahá’u’lláh’s home
region]. We will return to her around 1266.

II

The Execution of Qourrèt-oul-Aïne

It is certain that Qourrèt-oul-Aïne returned to Qasvine,5 because it was then that she was arrested
and taken to Téhéran where she was imprisoned in the house of Mahmoud Khan, the Qalenter [mayor].

She remained there for a long period, receiving numerous visits from men as well as women. She
impressed the latter by demonstrating the abject role that Islam had assigned to them, and she
captivated them in showing the liberty and respect accorded to them by the new religion. There were,
as a result, many domestic scenes from which the husbands did not always exit victorious.

These discussions could have lasted for a long time if Mirza Agha Khan Nouri had not been
appointed the Sadr A’azam. The prime minister gave the order to Hadji Molla Mirza Mohammed
Endermani and Hadji Molla Ali Kéni to interview her in order to examine her convictions. There were
seven meetings between the two men and the prisoner. She discoursed with passion and affirmed that
the Bab was the promised and awaited Imam. Her interviewers remarked to her that, according to the
prophecies, the promised Imam must come from [the heavenly cities of] Djab oul Qa and Djab oul Sa.
She replied to them with vehemence that this was not true, that these were false traditions, that these
two cities did not exist, and that this was only a superstition worthy of an ailing mind. She proclaimed
the new doctrine, bringing forth the truth, but they continued to clash with her citing the same
argument referring to Djab oul Qa.

Impatient with them, she said, “The arguments that you give are those of an ignorant and stupid
child. When will you stop these insanities, these lies? When will you lift your eyes to the Sun of
Reality?”

Infuriated by this blasphemy, Hadji Molla Ali arose and addressed his companion, saying: “What
would it profit us to have more discussions with an infidel?” They returned to the home of one of them
and drew up the verdict that, affirming her apostasy and her refusal to make penitence, condemned her
to death in the name of the Qoran!

One of the women, a Muslim maidservant in the house of the Qalenter, describes the sojourn of
Qourrèt-oul-Aïne there in this fashion:

The prisoner’s habit was to rise at the time of the séhèr (a little before dawn), while
> everyone else was still asleep. She made her ablutions, all the while softly chanting
> prayers and spontaneous praises of God. During the day she did not leave the room in
> which she was installed, which she kept in a state of scrupulous cleanliness. Nobody was
> admitted to her presence without having first obtained her permission. Alone, she was
> always carefully dressed and held herself as if she was in the midst of assembled company
> without letting anything go. Sometimes she arose and walked in her room while praying.
> The women who came to see her, after having received clearance, were all captivated by
> the charm of her beauty and her eloquence; they were won over and transported in their
> admiration of her.

While she was a prisoner, the marriage of the son of the Qalenter was held at the
> house. All the wives of the important personages in the town were naturally invited. But,
> no matter how much the family tried to entertain the guests with all the diversions that are
> encountered in these circumstances, with great cries the guests called for Qourrèt-oul-

Aïne to be brought in. Finally she presented herself, and she began to speak. Musicians
> and dancers were sent in, but forgetting all the sweet things of which they are so fond, the
> women had eyes and attention only for Qourrèt-oul-Aïne.

Finally, one night she left her room, as she was accustomed to doing. I was awake and
> I saw her go into the courtyard where she washed her whole body. Then she returned to
> her room, where she changed into all white clothing. She perfumed herself while singing,
> and I had never seen her so content and so joyous. She spoke to all the women of the
> household and begged them to pardon the discomforts which her presence had brought
> upon them and the wrongs she had committed towards them. She acted, in a word, exactly
> like someone who is going to undertake a great journey. We were all surprised, asking
> ourselves what this meant. The evening having arrived, she wrapped herself in a
> tchagehour. Her joy, in acting this way was so strange that we began to weep, for we loved
> her on account of her goodness and her inexhaustible benevolence. But she smiled at us
> and said: ‘Tonight I am going to undertake a great, a very great voyage.’ At that moment,
> there was a knock on the door to the street. ‘Run and open it,’ she said. ‘It is me they have
> come for.'

It was the Qalenter who entered. He came into her room and said to her: ‘Come,
madam, for you have been summoned.’

‘Yes,’ she said, ‘I know where I will be taken; I know what will be done to me. But,
> remember well, a day will come when your master will in turn kill you.’ (This prediction
> was realized in short order.)

She thus went out with the Qalenter, dressed as she was. We did not know where they
were taking her and did not learn until the next day that she had been executed.

One of the nephews of the Qalenter gives the following details on the death of Qourrèt-oul-Aïne:

When the juridical sentence of Hadji Molla Mirza Mohammed Endermi and Hadji
> Molla Ali Kéni, condemning to death the Babi apostle was submitted to the shah, His
> Majesty ordained her execution. The secret was carefully guarded and was known only to
> two government functionaries. Already some days before, my uncle had given me the order
> to attentively watch the police and by frequent patrols to assure myself that the policemen
> were actually at their posts. An ordinance was published forbidding the inhabitants of the
> city from remaining in the streets later than three hours after sunset, the hour after which
> it was forbidden for anyone to leave his dwelling. That night I received the order to
> establish a cordon of policemen from the house of the Qalenter to the garden of Ilkhani. I
> made excuses to my men as best I could and ordered them to fire upon whoever would
> present himself who was not of our administration. Four hours after sunset, the Qalenter
asked if all the measures had been taken and, based on the assurances I gave him, he

conducted me to his house. He entered alone into the enderoun [women’s quarters] and
returned soon afterwards accompanied by Qourrèt-oul-Aïne. He gave me a sealed
envelope saying: “Conduct this woman to the garden of Ilkhani and deliver the proof of
her receipt to Aziz Khan Serdar.”

A horse was brought and Qourrèt-oul-Aïne was mounted upon it. But, afraid that the
Babis might have been alerted to what was happening, I threw my coat over her in such a
way that she was taken to be a man. With a well-armed escort, we set off through the
streets. Notwithstanding the precautions I had taken and the large number of troops that I
had with me, I am convinced that, had we been attacked, all of them would have fled, so
much did the Babis inspire terror.

I let out a sigh of relief when we entered the garden. I had my prisoner placed in a
room, which was found under the corridor of the entryway, and ordered my soldiers to
carefully guard the door while I went to the first floor to find the serdar.

He was alone and awaited me. After having read the letter that I gave him, he asked
me, “Nobody knows who you have brought here?” “Nobody,” said I, “and now that I have
fulfilled my mission, give me the release form for my prisoner.” “No,” he said, “you must
assist in the execution, and I will then give you your receipt.”

He summoned a Turkish domestic manservant in his employ, a young man with a very
handsome face. The serdar gave him many compliments and said to him, “You have been
in my service for a long time, and I have been mistaken not to take note of you.
Nevertheless, I love you well and I want to reward you. Take these twenty pieces of gold,
spend them as you wish, and soon I will find you a good job. But while waiting, take this
silk handkerchief and go down with the officer. He will conduct you into a room where you
will find a young infidel woman who turns away the believers from the path of Muhammad.
Strangle her with this handkerchief — in this way you will render a great service to God,
and I will recompense you generously.

The valet responded and left with me. I conducted him to the room in which I had left
my prisoner. I found her prostrated and praying. The young man approached her to
execute the order he had received. Then she raised her head, looked him straight in the
eye, and said to him, “Young man! It would be unworthy for your hand to soil itself with
this murder.”

I don't know what happened in the soul of this domestic servant, but he ran off like a
madman. I ran after him, and we arrived together before the serdar to whom he declared
that it was impossible for him to accomplish the act that had been assigned to him. “I will
lose your protection,” he said. “I will lose myself. Do with me whatever you wish, but I
will not touch this woman.”

Aziz Khan chased him off and thought for a few minutes. He then called for one of his
> horsemen who, being punished for his bad behaviour, had been made to serve in the
> kitchen. When this man entered, he chided him amiably: “So, son of a dog, bandit,
> philanderer, I hope that your chastisement has made you reflect and that you will be wiser
> in the future. You should be disgusted now to engage in follies, and I think you are worthy
> of winning back my affection. It must have very much bothered you to go so long without
> being able to drink spirits. Here, take a large glass and drink, I give you leave.” He then
> gave him a new handkerchief and repeated the order that he had previously given to the
> young Turk.

We arrived together in the room. As soon as he entered, he attacked Qourrèt-oul-Aïne,
> put the handkerchief around her neck and pulled it several times. Unable to breathe, the
> woman fell to the ground. Then he put a knee on her back and pulled on the handkerchief
> with all his might. As he was roused up and afraid, he did not allow her time to exhale. He
> took her up in his arms in a swoon and carried her behind the wall of the icehouse. There
> was a well there into which he pitched her alive. We called some men, and we hastily filled
> up the well, because dawn was approaching.

Opposite the British Legation and the Embassy of Turkey, there was a fairly large yard which
disappeared after 1893. Towards the middle of this yard, but alongside the street, there were five or six
trees that marked the spot where the Babi heroine died, because at that time the garden of Ilkhani
extended to that place.

Upon my return [to Tehran], in 1898, the yard had disappeared, invaded by modern construction,
and I do not know whether the new owner honoured those trees, which a pious hand had planted.6
