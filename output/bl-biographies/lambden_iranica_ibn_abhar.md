**EBN ABHAR, MOḤAMMAD-TAQĪ** (1270-1337/1854-1919), Bahai teacher and one of the “hands of the cause” (see AYĀDĪ-E AMR-ALLĀH). He was one of two Bahai sons of Mirza ʿAbd-al-Raḥīm Eṣfahānī (d. 1290/1872), the Shiʿite _mojtahed_, a crypto-Babi and Bahai, and Belqīs Ḵānom. His zealous Bahai teaching in Zanjān, Qazvīn, Tehran, Yazd, Kermān, and elsewhere led to his frequent imprisonment, for the first time in 1295/1878. At various times resident or imprisoned in Abhar, between Qazvīn and Zanjān, he was entitled Ebn(-e) Abhar (“son of Abhar”) by Bahāʾ-Allāh in about 1300/1883. Around 1305/1887 Bahāʾ-Allāh appointed him one of the “hands of the cause.” Ebn(e) Abhar was imprisoned in Tehran in 1308-12/1890-94, and because he was chained with the same heavy chain that Bahāʾ-Allāh had worn in 1268-69/1852, the latter referred to him as his “chainmate” (_ham-zanjīr_). He became a permanent member of the first Central Spiritual Assembly established in Tehran at ʿAbd-al-Bahāʾ’s direction in 1314/1897. In 1316/1899, on the advice of ʿAbd-al-Bahāʾ, he married Monīra (d. 1326/1918), a daughter of a “hand of the cause,” ʿAlī-Akbar Šahmīrzādī. As a Bahai teacher, he visited Turkey and the Caucasus and lived for a while in Ashkhabad. He went to India in 1325/1907 accompanied by Mīrzā Maḥmūd Zarqānī and two American Bahais, Harlan Ober and Hooper Harris. In 1331/1913 he settled in Tehran. He visited Bahāʾ-Allāh or ʿAbd-al-Bahāʾ on more than ten occasions. He and his wife were active supporters of female education and emancipation.
