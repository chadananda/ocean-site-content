Abstract
Siyyid ‘Alí-Muhammad, known to history as the Báb, was born in 1819 in Shiraz
and in 1844 declared himself the Promised One of Islam, thereby inaugurating a new
religious movement in Iran. This is a translation of an important document written by
Mírzá Habíbu’lláh Afnán – a relative of the Báb – comprising family recollections of
the early days of the Báb. It relates the story of the early years of the Báb in Shiraz,
Bushihr and Karbala, including his marriage, and leading up to the declaration of his
mission in 1844. It then tells the story of the arrival of the Letters of the Living and
the departure of the Báb for his pilgrimage to Mecca. It continues with events after his
return from pilgrimage and the conversion of Siyyid Yahya Vahíd Dárábí, a leading
cleric of the period, as well as recounting the persecution that the Báb suffered at the
hands of the governor of Shiraz. Some of the details given in this account vary from
those given in Nabíl’s Narrative.2

In the 1920s in Iran, Mírzá Asadu’lláh Fádil Mázandarání, a renowned
scholar and capable historian, undertook a massive project to compose a
documented history of the Bábí–Bahá’í religions, which he entitled
Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq [The History of the Appearance of the True
One]—an effort that was greatly encouraged by Shoghi Effendi, the
1 The kindness of Abu’l-Qasim Afnan, who initially requested the translation of the
two narratives by his father, Mirza Habib Afnan, and offered many valuable
suggestions – some of which appear as footnotes under his name – in the course of
translation, and of Professor Juan R. I. Cole, who generously shared a copy of the
Táríkh Amrí Fárs va Shíráz manuscript, is warmly acknowledged.
2 Nabíl [Zarandí], The Dawn-Breakers: Nabíl’s Narrative of the Early Days of the Bahá’í

Revelation (trans. and ed. Shoghi Effendi, Wilmette, IL: Baha’i Publishing Trust,
1970)
12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith.3 For his history, Mázandarání needed
detailed accounts of events and occurrences during the first century of
the Bahá’í Faith. With the aim of gathering such data and
documentation, he and others traveled extensively throughout Iran and
vicinity, combing through the Bahá’í community for available
information, such as tablets, memoirs, letters, pictures, narratives,
poems, historical sites, and family trees. However, Mázandarání
recognized that he needed much more information, so he turned to
Shoghi Effendi for assistance.

In the latter part of 1924, Shoghi Effendi began the process of
recording the recollections of the Bahá’ís who had witnessed the early
years of the Bábí and Bahá’í Movements. Knowing that these memoirs
would have a profound effect on the understanding of future Bahá’ís
about the genesis of their religion, Shoghi Effendi called for a systematic
campaign to assemble such narratives. In the Haifa–‘Akká area,
companions of Bahá’u’lláh such as Áqá Husayn Áshchí [broth-maker]
and Áqá Abú’l-Qásim Bághbán [gardener] were interviewed for what
they remembered of the formative days of the Bábí–Bahá’í Faiths.
Sometimes, as in the case of Áshchí, such interviews happened literally
on the person’s deathbed.

During the next two decades, Shoghi Effendi wrote to the Bahá’ís
of Iran urging them to prepare detailed histories of each local
community, particularly those that had a significant Bahá’í presence from
the earliest days. He further called upon individuals who had witnessed
the unfolding of the Heroic Age (1844–1921) in the “Cradle of the
Faith” (Iran) to record their experiences in writing.

In accordance with this request, the Spiritual Assembly of the
Bahá’ís of Shíráz entrusted the task of writing a comprehensive history
of the Bahá’í Faith in this central region to Mírzá Habíbu’lláh Afnán, the
hereditary custodian of the House of the Báb in Shíráz, who readily
obeyed and wrote of what he had witnessed and the remarkable stories

3 Shoghi Effendi himself also participated in this enterprise, first by producing an
elegant edited translation of Nabíl Zarandí’s history, The Dawn-Breakers, and later by
writing two monumental analytical histories of the Bábí–Bahá’í Faiths, respectively
entitled God Passes By and Lawh-i Qarn [Tablet of the Century].
12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

that he had heard from those associated with the founding of the Bábí–
Bahá’í Faiths. Mírzá Habíbu’lláh notes:

> In accordance with the instructions of the Guardian of the
> Cause of God in his wondrous and blessed letter, which
> stated: “Each town must write a brief history of the Faith
> since the dawning of the Sun of Horizons,” the Spiritual
> Assembly [of Shíráz] entrusted this service to this unworthy
> servant, Hájí Mírzá Habíbu’lláh Afnán. Even though this
> ephemeral servant considers himself unprepared for this
> great enterprise, yet hopeful of the divine confirmations of
> the Beloved, has committed to paper to a prescribed degree
> what he has seen or heard from reliable observers, that the
> sanctified command of the Guardian be fulfilled.4

Fárs and Shíráz
The land of Fárs is a province that millennia earlier had given birth to
two great dynasties—the Achaemenian in the sixth century BC and the
Sassanian in the third century AD. These empires were administered by
leaders of great insight and learning, and engendered cultivated societies,
formidable armies, great visions for humanity, and just rulers whose
achievements were legendary and unprecedented. Indeed, the brilliance
of their triumphs was so dazzling that the name of the region was
extended to the entire country, and Persia—from Persis, the Greek form
of Fárs—was born.5 Therefore, for Persians the name Fárs evokes a deep
sense of pride and heritage. It calls to mind the past splendors associated
with that cradle of civilization, when wise rulers from their seat in
Persepolis wielded authority over a kingdom that extended from North
Africa to China—kings who governed with such liberty and equity that
the authors of the Old Testament were prompted to speak most
glowingly of their benevolence.

5Fárs is the Arabicized version of Párs. Persia and Persian both derive from Persis, the
Hellenized form of the root word Párs. The Old Persian word was Pârsâ.
12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

The language of the nation, Fársí—the language of Fárs—
descends lineally from the language that Cyrus and Darius spoke and is
the language in which the proclamations were engraved by their
command on the rock-tablets of Bí-sitún and Naqsh Rustam, and upon
the walls and columns of Persepolis. This language stirs a profound
sense of spirituality and refinement derived from the poetry of Háfiz,
voice of the invisible and the master of Persian lyrical poetry, and Sa‘dí,
the sweet-tongued poet and the author of the famous Gulistán, a book of
sonnets called the Garden of Roses. No other Iranian writers to this day
enjoy—not only in their own country but also wherever their language is
cultivated—a wider celebrity or a greater reputation than these two poets
of Shíráz. Indeed, for Iranians, there is no Persian language more
elevated than that which they have learned from Háfiz and Sa‘dí, and
deep in their collective consciousness the legacy of these two towering
literary giants of Shíráz pervades modern Iranian culture.6

Beyond the circle of Iranians, the Bahá’í world community will
forever associate the name of Shíráz with the opening chapter of its own
history, for it was in Shíráz that the initial emanation of the divine
revelation for this religion broke forth from the merchant-Prophet of
that city. The Báb, He Who is acclaimed as the “Point round Whom the
realities of the Prophets and Messengers revolve,”7 Who styled Himself
“the Primal Point from which have been generated all created
things...the Countenance of God Whose splendor can never be
obscured, the Light of God Whose radiance can never fade,”8 arose
meteor-like over the horizon of Shíráz.

In regard to this city, Bahá’u’lláh has written:

> Sanctified be God! The All-Glorious Providence has decreed for the
> land of Sh[íráz] to be the dawning-place of light and fire. That is,
> before God, the appearance of these two attributes is most prominent
> and most evident in that realm. And this is because the fire of

> other lands.9

Mírzá Habíbu’lláh Afnán
It was in the House of the Báb in Shíráz that Mírzá Habíbu’lláh Afnán
(1875–1951) was born and then reared by none other than Khadíjih
Bagum, the widow of the Báb. The stories that he heard from her were
the bittersweet stories of the Báb and the deeply devoted disciples who
circled around the Báb in Shíráz. Khadíjih Bagum had a particular
affinity towards the young lad’s father, Áqá Mírzá Áqá Núri’d-Dín, who,
at a time when tribulations had most fiercely beset Khadíjih Bagum, was
promised by the Báb to be the family member who would arise for her
protection and support, and who had done just that. This immense love
of Khadíjih Bagum likewise readily embraced Núri’d-Dín’s children, and
Mírzá Habíbu’lláh basked in the brilliance of her attention and affection.

In 1891–92 at the age of 16, Mírzá Habíbu’lláh was fortunate to be
able to accompany his family to the Holy Land, where he spent some
nine months in the immediate proximity of Bahá’u’lláh in the Mansion
of Bahjí. Subsequently, from Egypt he remained in constant
communication for the next decade with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and periodically
visited Him in ‘Akká, where as a trusted Afnán he was privy to some of
the heart-wrenching scenes of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ministry and granted a
glimpse into the most private inner workings of the Bahá’í Faith—he
witnessed the disloyalty of the half-brothers of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, their
corrupt ways, the consequent anguish of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
efforts to conceal their perversion and their violation of laws, and the
means by which this sad news was transmitted to the Bahá’í community.

At the turn of the century, in 1902, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wished for
Núri’d-Dín and his family, including his son, Mírzá Habíbu’lláh, to
return to Shíráz to rebuild the House of the Báb, which had fallen into
disrepair. Shortly before the completion of this reconstruction, Núri’d-
Dín passed away, and it fell to Mírzá Habíbu’lláh to complete the

construction and to become the custodian of that sacred edifice. This
was the hallmark service of his life, as for the next half-century he served
with great distinction as the hereditary custodian of the House of the
Báb in Shíráz. Consequently, he stood uniquely qualified to tell the story
of the Bábí and Bahá’í Movements in Shíráz as well as to recount his
recollections of the days of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the Holy
Land.

Narratives of Mírzá Habíbu’lláh Afnán
Mírzá Habíbu’lláh wrote two lengthy documents. The date of
composition of the first narrative, entitled Táríkh Amrí Fárs va Shíráz, is
not known with any degree of precision, although it has been estimated
to be in the 1920s or possibly in the early- to mid-1930s. The original
version was handwritten by Mírzá Habíbu’lláh, and the final draft was
written by Mírzá Abú’l-Hasan Ansif Nayrízí. This final copy was edited
by the author, whose handwritten remarks are evident along various
margins and lines throughout the manuscript; this is the version used for
translation purposes.

Of this first narrative, unquestionably the most valuable portions
are those on the life of the Báb in Shíráz, a city acclaimed by the young
Prophet as the baladu’l-amn, “the land of refuge.”10 Mírzá Habíbu’lláh did
not wish to write a comprehensive history of the Báb’s life, since he
knew full well that others had already attempted such an undertaking—
men like Nabíl Zarandí, surnamed Nabíl A‘zam, who was well known to
Mírzá Habíbu’lláh. Rather, his objective was to tell stories of the Báb’s
sublime life that were current among the Báb’s immediate family in
Shíráz, particularly reminiscences he had heard from Khadíjih Bagum.11

10 INBMC (Iranian National Bahá’í Manuscript Collection) 91:6–10, no. 3, and
91:13–14, no. 4. In chapter 55 of Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’, the Báb refers to Himself as the
Gate of the land of refuge (Báb-i baladu’l-amn). Verse 35 of the chapter “Pillar” (rukn)
of the same book refers to Shíráz as the baladu’l-amn.
11 Those not fully familiar with the story of the Báb may find it helpful while reading

this history to refer to Nabíl’s history, presented in an edited version in The Dawn-
Breakers, and to Hasan Balyúzí’s biography, The Báb. These volumes describe many
of the persons and incidents mentioned in this narrative, but depict them in a wider

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

The second narrative, entitled Khátirát Hayát, is the account of
Mírzá Habíbu’lláh’s pilgrimages to the Holy Land and his decade-long
stay in Egypt. The exact date of the composition of this autobiography is
unknown, but the author’s sons, Abú’l-Qásim and Hasan Afnán, indicate
that it was first composed shortly after Mírzá Habíbu’lláh’s return to
Iran.12 Based upon the evidence in the narrative and family records, it is
known that these notes were recopied and reorganized in the mid-
1940s.13 Of this narrative, the most important part is the author’s
recollection of being near Bahá’u’lláh from the middle of July 1891 until
shortly after Naw-Rúz 1892, that is, a little more than two months prior
to the passing of Bahá’u’lláh. The remaining portions are singularly
important, as they clarify many aspects of the first decade of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s ministry when the opposition of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s half-brothers was
at its height.14

Mírzá Habíbu’lláh was a well-educated man. He attended the same
school that the Báb had attended and received tuition from one of the
city’s ablest educators. Bahá’u’lláh arranged for him to study with His
own sons in the Mansion of Bahjí. Subsequently, he spent many years
receiving daily instructions from the celebrated Mírzá Abu’l-Fadl
Gulpáygání, one of the most erudite Bahá’ís of his generation. Therefore,
the style of his composition is very learned and represents an important
literary achievement in its own right. It is hoped that in due course the
original Persian of these two narratives will also be published so that
students of history will become better acquainted with his elegant style
of composition.15
context. For an academic treatment of the same subject, see Abbas Amanat,
Resurrection and Renewal.
12 Private communications, summer 1985.
13 For example, Mírzá Habíbu’lláh notes that fifty-five years had elapsed since the

spring of 1892 when he had met Tarazu’llah Samandari in the Holy Land, and
assuming these years are reckoned in accordance with the lunar calendars, this then
places the date of recomposition around 1945–46.

Notes on the Present Translation
What is offered in this monograph represents merely a rendering of the
first 115 pages of Táríkh Amrí Fars va Shiraz, where the story of the Báb
is told.16 In the course of this translation, every effort has been exerted
to stay as close to the original document as possible, to the degree that a
literal rendering has often been preferred to a more stylistic one.
Footnotes have been added to augment information, clarify obscure
points, and provide a more detailed perspective. Occasionally, comments
by the translator have been added to improve the clarity or continuity of
the material. These comments are enclosed in square brackets, thus […].
All comments within parentheses are by the author, Mírzá Habíbu’lláh.
The system of transliteration used in this monograph is consistent with
the method used in other academic publications and varies from the
system used in most Bahá’í publications by: (1) avoiding subdots and
underlines (e.g., Fádil), and (2) dropping the izafih connecting the first
name to the surname (e.g., Husayn-‘Alí Núrí, instead of Husayn-‘Alíy-i-
Núrí). The page numbers of the original manuscript are indicated in
square brackets, such as [p. 10], every five pages.

Since any single Islamic year (denoted AH) typically overlaps with
two Christian years, where only the Islamic year of the event is known,
the equivalent Gregorian date is given as the first of the two years
partially covered by that Islamic year.

Typically, the original text refers to the Central Figures by such
honorific titles as “His Holiness” or “His blessed Person,” and these
honorifics have been omitted for the most part. Nor does the translation
reproduce such expressions commonly used in the Iranian literature of
the Bahá’í Faith as, “May my life be a sacrifice unto His Sacred
Threshold.” Many key individuals are often referred to by titles, such as
His Holiness the Exalted One, a reference to the Báb; or the Blessed

and approved by the Baha’i World Centre for publication. It is scheduled for
publication in 2008.

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

Perfection or the Blessed Beauty, expressions used for Bahá’u’lláh; or
“the exalted wife,” a term used to refer to Khadíjih Bagum, the widow of
the Báb. These titles have been replaced with their more recognizable
names, the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, or Khadíjih Bagum.

By the time Mírzá Habíbu’lláh wrote his narrative, many principal
personalities featured in this history had died, and the original text
therefore often refers to them as “the late” or “the deceased.” These
terms, too, have largely been omitted.

Some details of the events recorded in Mírzá Habíbu’lláh’s
chronicle differ from those found in Nabíl’s Narrative, the standard
history of these events. However, given that the chronicle represents an
oral tradition within the family of the Báb, it has its own importance and
must form part of the analysis of historians. It should be emphasized
that the spoken words attributed to the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, and ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá in these pages cannot be ascribed with scriptural authority or
equated with their authorized Writings. No one took notes at the time
those words were uttered, although it cannot be ruled out that some may
indeed be the very words spoken.

First Portion of Táríkh Amrí Fars va Shiraz
The Beginning of the History
[p. 2:1] The names of the paternal and maternal ancestors of the Báb are
as follows:

The blessed name of the Báb was Áqá Mírzá ‘Alí-Muhammad,17

son of Mír[zá] Muhammad-Ridá, the son of Áqá Mír[zá] Nasru’lláh, the
son of Áqá Mír[zá] Fathu’lláh, the son of Áqá Mír[zá] Ibráhím.18 He was
born into a highly regarded family of Husayní Siyyids19 to whose nobility,
integrity, trustworthiness, piety, devotion, and detachment everyone in
the province of Fárs would testify. Merchants by profession, they were
all considered exemplary in integrity and purity in the entire region of
Fárs. The mother of the Báb was Fátimih Bagum, the daughter of Hájí
Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn, who was the son of Áqá Mírzá ‘Abid,20 the
son of Áqá Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad. This family also ranked among the
renowned and trustworthy merchants of Fárs.

Early Years
His blessed birth took place on the first night of Muharram AH 1235 [20
October 1819], in the house belonging to His mother’s paternal uncle,

17 In the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’, Surih al-Qarabih [kinsmen], verse 14, the Báb reveals:

> Verily, We have named this Remembrance by two Names from the
> divine Self, after two Beloved Ones among Our servants in the
> heavens.

18 The Báb gives a slightly different genealogy in Sahífih Baynu’l-Haramayn (The Treatise

Between the Two Shrines): “Say: My name is Muhammad after the word ‘Alí [i.e., ‘Alí-
Muhammad]. And the name of My father, as hath been revealed in the Book of God,
is Ridá after Muhammad. And the name of My grandfather in the Book of God is
Ibráhím [Abraham], and his father is named Nasru’lláh as has been revealed in the
Qur’án (Fathu’lláh)” (Browne Or. MSS F.7[9]). The final statement is a reference to
Qur’án 61:13: “And another [favor will He bestow], which ye do love—help from
God [Nasru’lláh] or a speedy victory [Fathu’lláh]; so give the glad tidings to the
believers.” The same genealogy is given in the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’, Surih al-Qaribih,
verses 14–15.
19 That is, this family traced its ancestry to Imám Husayn.
20 Fayzí, Hadrat Nuqtih Ula, p. 64, gives his name as Zaynu’l-‘Abidín.

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

Áqá Mírzá ‘Alí.21 The oft- recounted utterances of that exalted lady, the
mother of the Báb, were along these lines:

> From the moment of birth, it was evident that, unlike other
> children, He was not rapacious in drinking milk. Normally,
> He was serene and made no noise. During the twenty-four-
> hour period, He would desire milk only four times. While
> nursing he would be most gentle, and no movement was
> discerned from His mouth. Often I would become anxious
> and ask myself, “Why is this Child not like other children?
> Perhaps He has some illness that prevents His desiring
> milk.” Then I would console myself, saying, “If He really
> had some unknown illness, He would manifest signs of
agitation and restlessness.”

Unlike other children, He did not complain or behave
> in an unseemly manner during the weaning period. I was
> most thankful that now that the Exalted Lord had granted
> me this one Child, He was gentle and agreeable.

Moreover, according to what trustworthy persons have reported, it
was evident from the beginning of His childhood that He had an
extraordinary character that excited the wonder and amazement of all,
whether relatives, friends, or strangers, for He [p. 5] was unlike any other
child.

Schooling

21 The Báb provides the date of His birth in the Sahifih Baynu’l-Haramayn: “Say O
denizens of the Concourse! Hear the command of the Remnant of God from this
Servant, the Exalted, the Wise. And this Servant was born, as hath been concealed in
the Book of God, on the first day of Muharram of the year twelve hundred and thirty-
five.” Also, the same date can be computed precisely from His age given in His
personal diary appended to the Azali publication of the Kitáb Panj Sha’n (the Book of
Five Modes). Other references to His age are to be found in the Persian Bayán 2:1 and
4:11, and the Dala’il Sab‘a (the Seven Proofs).

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

According to Mullá Fathu’lláh Maktab-Dár [the school-master], son of
Mullá Mand-‘Alí, when His blessed age had reached five years old,22 He
was taken to the [quranic school of] Shaykh ‘Abid,23 known as Shaykh
Anám,24 located in Qahviyih Awlíyá,25 one of the mystic convents
occupied by the mystics of Fárs, on the Tayr marketplace,26 near the
house of His maternal grandfather, and His respected maternal uncle.
Mullá Fathu’lláh Maktab-Dár, son of Mullá Mand-‘Alí, was the custodian
of the Masjid Vakíl.27 Like his father, he was one of the early believers [in
the Báb] and, because of the persecutions and harassment, became a
fugitive and forced to travel extensively.28 He related:

> When they brought His Holiness to the maktab [quranic
> school], I worked for Shaykh Anám in the Qahviyih Awlíyá,
> which is one of the mystic convents in the old

22 In Persian, when someone’s age is reported as, say, five years of age, it means they
are in their fifth year of life. In English, during the whole of the fifth year of life, a
child is said to be four years old. In general, whenever age is given in Bahá’í histories
translated from the Persian, it is necessary to subtract one to get the age in the
English manner of reckoning. However, in the present translation, everywhere an
age is provided, the original Persian reckoning is given.
23 His given name was Shaykh Muhammad (d. AH 1263/AD 1847), and he is also

known as Shaykh Zaynu’l-‘Abidín or Shaykh Mu‘allim. The Báb mentioned him in the
Arabic Bayán 6:11, “Say: O Muhammad, My teacher! Do not beat Me ere My years
have gone beyond five.”
24 A variation of the same name, Shaykhuná, is employed in Nabíl A‘zam, The Dawn-

Breakers, p. 75.
25 Named after a certain Sufi saint, Dervish Awlíyá (d. AH 1119/AD 1707), this

convent is occupied by the dervishes and Sufis. Located in the Bazaar Murgh, it is
situated near the house of the Báb’s maternal uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ‘Alí, and over
the years it has decayed so thoroughly that no trace of it is now evident.
26 Known also as the Bazaar Murgh [poultry market] quarter, this is one of the most

prosperous and religiously significant quarters of the city and one of the five Haydarí
wards of Shíráz. For further details, see Fasá’í, Fársnámih Násirí, vol. 2, pp. 27–47.
27 Masjid Vakíl was the largest and most important of Shíráz’s mosques.
28 Mullá Fathu’lláh and his father converted on the day the Báb proclaimed His Call in

the aforementioned mosque. Both were among the martyrs at Shaykh Tabarsí, and
therefore his recollection of the Báb must have been conveyed to the Afnán family at
an early time.

Description of His Condition During Childhood

29 Mírzá Habíbu’lláh adds parenthetically, “And the center of this convent was
inhabited, surrounded by ruins and evidence of old graves and gravestones.”
30 A.Q. Afnán has said that on that occasion, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ‘Alí, the Báb’s maternal

uncle, went to the school (private communication, August 1993).

31 This suggests that the Báb woke before dawn to offer His first morning prayer
and, unlike most others, was not combining the first and the second Muslim
obligatory prayer.
32 A.Q. Afnán suggests that only the Báb and His maternal uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid

‘Alí, were present on that occasion (private communication, August 1993).

“In another instance, a while ago He informed us,

The late Áqá Muhammad Ibráhím Ismá‘íl Beg, who was a well-
known, trusted, and respected merchant, related:

> I was twelve years old at that time, and on that day Siyyid-i
> Báb came and sat between me and Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-

> aloud, and they came to this verse:

From Heaven’s heights the birdsong calls to you

in sorrow that you’re trapped in walls of clay.

He turned quickly to me and said, “That is your
answer.” I replied, “Well done.”38

Similarly, it is related:

37 Nabíl A‘zam, The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 75–76, tells a similar story, though
considerably different in details.

In all events, during those tender years, many such manifestations
of extraordinary and innate qualities were observed in Him and are
testified to by both friends and foes, and are beyond my abilities to
describe.40
39 See Balyúzí, The Báb, p. 35. For similar childhood stories of the Báb, see Nabíl
A‘zam, The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 75–76.
40 The Báb in the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’, Surih al-Sina, verse 5, addressing Himself states,

“And We favored Thee during Thy Childhood with the mighty Cause of God, as it
had been decreed as such in the Mother Book.” In the same Book, Surih al-Ism,

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

His father, Áqá Mír[zá] Muhammad-Ridá, passed away when the
Báb was only nine years old,41 and from then on He was reared in the
bosom of His maternal uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ‘Alí. This uncle had
witnessed such remarkable and astonishing feats by Him with his own
eyes, that when He declared His Cause, without requiring any proof or
evidence, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ‘Alí readily and unhesitatingly accepted His
claim and became a believer. He sacrificed his life and possessions in the
path of the Beloved of the world.

The Testimony of the Khál A‘zam
My paternal grandmother, [Zahrá Bagum], who was a paternal cousin of
the Báb’s mother, related that she had personally heard the uncle [Hájí
Mírzá Siyyid ‘Alí] discussing [the claim of the Báb] with his younger
brother, Hájí Mírzá Hasan-‘Alí, and the latter was resisting the argument
saying, “Brother, what religious principles are these that you have turned
to now? You have departed from our ancestral religion and follow our
Nephew!” The eminent, martyred-uncle responded, “You should know
well that God Most High has fulfilled the proof before me. After what I
saw with my own eyes in His childhood and what I know with complete
confidence about him since His adulthood, there is no room for doubt
for anyone, especially for me.”

He then continued:

> Have you forgotten our journey to Sabz-Púshán42 when He
> was a child aged nine years old? There was a group of us,

verse 34, the Báb proclaims, “Verily, as a child I was aware of the truth of My own
Self, and God is the Almighty, the All-knowing.”
41 In the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’, Surih al-Jihad, verse 39, the Báb states, “O My God, My

Lord! Verily, in accordance with Thy will, My father passed away, and I do not
remember Him. My Master, when he is seated with the heavenly angels, inform him
of My Cause and record him in this Mighty Book.”
42 Mírzá Habíbu’lláh added parenthetically, “Located in the mountains south of Shíráz,

the shrine of Sabz-Púshán is about twelve kilometers from the city. The route to that
place is most difficult, and even strong individuals are exhausted by the journey.
People often visit that spot in the summer.”

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

> and He came along as well. When we arrived, being
> completely exhausted, we performed our ablutions, offered
> our late afternoon and the evening obligatory prayers, [p. 20]
> paid our homage of visitation, ate dinner, and went to bed.
> It was not long after, at midnight, that I awoke and noticed
> that He was not in bed. Deeply perturbed, I was overtaken
> with anxiety that perhaps He had fallen from the mountain.
> Finally, after searching extensively, I heard a voice raised in
> the obligatory prayer and prayers of glorification to the
> Lord, coming from the lower extremities [of the mountain].
> When I followed the melody of that chant, I found the
> Child, standing alone and in private, in consummate rapture
> voicing prayers and supplications to the One Who
> transcends all mention, on the deserted mountainside and at

In short, our grandmother often spoke to us on this theme.

Commerce
When the Báb had reached the age of fifteen, He joined the commercial
office of His uncle, [Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ‘Alí], in Shíráz.43 He remained for
43 A.Q. Afnán suggests that based on extensive family correspondence examined by
him, the Báb began to work in His uncle’s office at the age of ten, and it was at the age
of fifteen—the age of maturity in Islamic law—that He moved to Búshihr (private
communications, August 1992). The same information is provided by the Báb Himself
in the Kitáb Fihrist, “After My childhood had passed, by the will of God, I began the

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

a short while in Shíráz and then moved to the port city of Búshihr. In
that city, His office was in the Mínandí caravansary. Although it was
before the declaration of His Cause, the many signs and evidences of His
sanctity and the wondrous verses that flowed from His blessed pen
would attract the envy and the jealousy of men of learning.44

One day in Egypt during the time when the illustrious Abú’l-Fadl
was occupied with writing the Kitáb-i Fará’íd, we came to talk about the
early years of the Báb prior to His declaration and the period when He
was engaged in trading. Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl related the following to me:

> I myself heard Hájí Siyyid Javád known as Karbalá’í relate
> that

> when His Holiness [the Báb] was active as a merchant
> in Búshihr, because of my friendship and close
> association with His maternal uncles, I used to stay
> with them whenever I visited either Shíráz or Búshihr.
> One day Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad, a maternal
> uncle [of the Báb], came to me with a request, “Give
> some good counsel to my Nephew. Tell Him not to
> write or speak about certain studies that can only
> provoke the jealousy of certain people. These people
> cannot tolerate seeing a young merchant of little
> schooling demonstrate such scientific erudition and
> therefore become envious and resentful.” He was very
> insistent that I should counsel Him [to desist from
> such activities], but in the end I replied with this verse:

> The luster of the fair of face cannot be veiled,
> Shut him in and out of eyelet will he show his
visage.

occupation of commerce as this was decreed by God, and I commenced this from the
age of ten.”
44 Nicolas, Seyyed Ali Mohammad dit le Bab, p. 189, n. 131, on the authority of Hájí

Mírzá Jání of Kashan, whom Nicolas assumed to be the author of the Kitáb-i
Nuqtatu’l-Kaf, suggests that at the age of eighteen the Báb revealed Risálih Fiqihiyyih.

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

> and added: “We are earthbound and He is celestial.

Our counsel is no use to Him.”45

In Búshihr He engaged in commerce for six years46 and associated
with all strata of society, including the ‘ulamá, the merchants, and the
shopkeepers, and dealt with all in such wise that they were very satisfied
and grateful in every respect. In every gathering and assembly, men
praised His splendid qualities.

During one of my journeys to the sacred presence of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, He spoke one day about the time the Báb stayed [in Búshihr] and
of his commercial activities. He stated:

> During His stay in Búshihr, the Báb achieved extraordinary
> things and thoroughly demolished the foundation of
> people’s corrupt practices. The merchants of Búshihr had a
> custom that after a deal had been concluded they would
> renege and barter to receive a considerable discount. Some
> of them came to His Holiness, negotiated purchase of
> indigo dye, and bought a very large quantity. After they had
> sealed the bargain and moved the lots of indigo to their own
> office, they returned to renege and bargain. His Holiness did
> not accept and said, “You made a bargain, [p. 25] signed
> papers, and the transaction has been completed. I will not
> give a discount and will not renegotiate.” They insisted. He
> replied, “What I said is final.” They pleaded, “It is the
> custom of the country.” He responded, “Many of these
> customs are wrong and will soon be abolished.” No matter
> how much they insisted, He would not agree. The
> merchants were obstinate, and at last He said, “[If] the price
> is high, return the merchandise as I will not barter.” They
> insisted, “It is the custom here.” He replied, “I wish to put

45A similar translation appears in Balyúzí, The Báb, pp. 39–40.
46The Báb indicates He was in Búshihr for five years; see Selections from the Writings of the
Báb, pp. 180–81.

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

> an end to this custom.” They insisted, “If a merchant has
> bought commodities and moved them to his warehouse, and
> then returns them, he will forfeit his standing with
> merchants.” “It is your choice,” He told them, “accept the
> terms and refrain from re-negotiation.” Again they insisted,
> “But this is the custom of the realm.” Yet again, He
> reminded them, “I am ending this custom.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá continued relating:

> Eventually, He [the Báb] ordered the merchandise brought
> back to His shop and did not yield to their efforts at
> bargaining. He changed many of their unseemly practices
during the period He was a merchant in Búshihr.

Soon thereafter, one of His maternal uncles arrived at
> Búshihr, and the same merchants who had returned the
> indigo dye came to see the uncle and complained about His
> behavior, saying, “He has ruined our reputation. We had a
> deal on dyes, however, as customary, we wished to
> renegotiate, but He did not comply. He arranged for the
> goods to be brought back from our store. This is a great
> insult to us as merchants. You should counsel Him not to
repeat such offenses.”

The maternal uncle approached the Báb advising
> Him, “Why do You refuse to yield to people’s wishes and
> disrupt the established customs of the realm?” He told him,
> “Even now, if they should wish to bargain after a
> transaction is completed, I would refuse again.”

That was a very blissful day. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá smiled unceasingly and
repeated several times, “Prior to His declaration, the Báb announced that
He would change many of the accepted ways.”

In short, after six years’ residence in Búshihr, [the Báb] wrote
several times to His uncles, “I plan to visit the ‘Atabát.47 One of you

47   The ‘Atabát is a general term referring to the region where Najaf, Karbalá,

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

should come to Búshihr and take over the business so I can commence
my journey to the ‘Atabát.” The uncles procrastinated and did not
comply with His wish. When the time for His departure arrived, He
settled His accounts with everyone, prepared a detailed ledger, sealed the
books, and left them in the office. He then sealed the entrance to the
office and entrusted the key to the custodian of that building with the
instructions that whichever of His maternal uncles should arrive first
from Shíráz to Búshihr should be allowed to enter. Thereupon, He
wrote to Shíráz “Though I wrote you repeatedly asking that one of you
come to Búshihr as I have a journey to the ‘Atabát in mind, you have not
come. Therefore, I have sealed the door of the shop and entrusted the
key to the custodian and have left for the ‘Atabát.”48 So, after six years in
Búshihr, He left for the ‘Atabát.

Once His blessed letter was received in Shíráz, [His eldest
maternal uncle,] Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad became deeply worried
and perturbed, complaining, “What manner of conduct is this? Our good
name in the commercial community will be ruined, and the chain of our
business transactions will be broken! What will happen to our accounts
with the people?” To this, the illustrious uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ‘Alí,
responded, “Rest assured! I know Him, and our Nephew does not do
anything wrong. [I am certain that] He has arranged people’s accounts
before leaving.”

The uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad, set out for Búshihr.49

Upon his arrival, he secured the key from the custodian of the
caravansary, noted the seal on the door of the room, opened the door,
and began a careful examination of the books. He found that the
accounts relating to every person were most satisfactory and accurate.

Kázimayn, and Sámarrá are located. The first of the two cities hold within them the
Shrines of Imám ‘Alí and Imám Husayn, respectively. Kázimayn is famous because
the Shrines of the seventh and the ninth Imáms are located there. Sámarrá is where
the Shrines of the tenth and the eleventh Imáms, ‘Alí an-Naqi and Hasan al-‘Askarí,
are situated.
48 Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl, Táríkh Zuhúr Díyánt Hadrat Báb va Hadrat Bahá’u’lláh, gives the date

of Báb’s departure as 1 Rabí‘u’l-Avval AH 1257 [23 April 1841].
49 A.Q. Afnán suggests that it was the younger uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ‘Alí, who went

on Búshihr. (Private communications, Nov. 1992).

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

Relieved, he wrote to his brothers, “the accounts and record books are in
order” [p. 30] and expressed praise and gratitude for their Nephew.50

In the ‘Atabát
The Báb arrived at the ‘Atabát. His blessed stay in the ‘Atabát is an
extensive story, but it will be related here briefly, as our attention is
focused on events in Fárs.

One day Mullá Husayn, who at that time was engaged in studies in
the ‘Atabát under the tutelage of Siyyid [Kázim Rashtí], saw His Holiness
[the Báb] while He was standing in prayer at the sanctuary of the Shrine
of the Prince of Martyrs.51 He saw a young Siyyid, aged twenty-two,
offering His supplications with an intense humility and rapture that was
not to be observed previously among any of the ‘ulamá, the mystics, or
the pilgrims [to that sacred Shrine]. He was carried away with petitioning
God and performing the rites of pilgrimage. Mullá Husayn was
astounded and attracted by his beauty and perfection. He approached
[the Báb] and greeted Him. However, wrapped in devotions, His
Holiness did not reply. Mullá Husayn moved to the back and waited
there. Having completed the pilgrimage prayers in the inner sanctuary,
[the Báb] went out to the courtyard, and to Mullá Husayn’s utter
astonishment, repeated the pilgrimage prayers there.

Once more, Mullá Husayn approached and greeted Him. Being
occupied with His prayers, [the Báb] did not respond, which further
deepened the Akhúnd’s wonder.52

When [the Báb] had completed the pilgrimage prayers, He moved
outside from the courtyard. The Akhúnd [Mullá Husayn] approached
Him and greeted Him. This time, [the Báb] returned his greeting and

Breakers, pp. 77–80.
51 A reference to Imám Husayn.
52 Mullá Husayn is referred to as ‘Akhúnd’, meaning a lower-level divine who serves

the people, somewhat analogous to a parish priest or a teacher of divinity at a school.
The term has become pejorative in modern times but has been retained in several
places in the present translation in the interest of authenticity. In a few places though it
has been replaced with ‘Mullá Husayn’ to clarify the meaning.

apologized, “Twice you have showed your courtesy, but absorbed and
transported in the rites of pilgrimage, concentrating only on the exalted
Shrine of the Imám—upon Him be peace—I did not respond. For this,
I wish to apologize. Whosoever attains that sacred ground must forget
himself and all worldly matters. As such, I had become oblivious of My
own Self and overcome with other conditions. Once more, I apologize
to you.”53

Hearing such a speech only served to enhance the amazement of
the Akhúnd, as he had never thought that a young merchant could
manifest such extraordinary depth of humility, reverence, piety, and
veneration. It was unusual and contrary to the fashionable neglect of
religion. Therefore, he extensively expressed the depth of his gratitude
and thanks, and asked, “Master, where is Your home, for I wish to make
the customary courtesy call?” [The Báb] told him how to find the house.
[Mullá Husayn] then said, “Siyyid [Kázim Rashtí] holds a service of
prayers and admonition at his own home every Friday morning. Should
You decide to attend, it would greatly honor the assembly, and we would
be profoundly grateful.” [The Báb] responded, “There is no harm in
that,” and promised to attend the session.

The Akhúnd reported with great care the details of what had
transpired to Siyyid [Kázim] who had smiled and recited this verse:

> That which my heart had understood in dreams
> was hidden behind this veil, and is now found.

During the last two or three years, Hájí Siyyid Kázim Rashtí
devoted his sermons and lectures solely to the manifestation of the
Promised Proof. He repeatedly expounded on the signs of His
appearance and the characteristics of the Lord of Command. Many a
time he would tell [his students that the promised Qá’im] must be young,
not instructed by anyone else, and must be a scion of the Baní-Háshim.54

53 For a description of a similar observation by Shaykh Hasan Zunúzí, see Nabíl
A‘zam, The Dawn-Breakers, p. 30.
54 That is, a direct descendant of the Prophet Muhammad.

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

On the morning of the appointed Friday, [the Báb] made his
promised visit to the home of the Siyyid where the latter was occupied
with preaching from the pulpit and the house was filled to capacity with
worshippers. Finding no seat available, His Holiness [the Báb] sat at the
threshold. On seeing His countenance, the late Siyyid said no more,
preferring pure silence. All those present were astonished. After a
quarter of an hour, he resumed an oration regarding the signs of the
manifestation of the Promised One. He said, “Behold, He is manifest as
the sun” [p. 35]. With these words he concluded his arguments and
descended the pulpit.55 It was at this moment that with the utmost
reverence Akhúnd Mullá Husayn approached His Holiness [the Báb] and
led Him to a seat next to the Siyyid.

Were I to detail the sojourn of the Báb in the ‘Atabát and the
events that transpired there and the glad tidings imparted by the late
Siyyid, it would be like a Qur’án commentary or a thick book of history.
But our purpose is to outline the events in Fárs.

Return from the ‘Atabát
After six months of His blessed stay in the ‘Atabát had passed, His
mother, longing to see her only Offspring, earnestly petitioned her
brother, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ‘Alí, to proceed for the ‘Atabát and to bring
His Holiness to Shíráz—a matter that she greatly insisted upon. Deeply
devoted to his sister and Nephew, the illustrious uncle agreed and
proceeded at once to the ‘Atabát.

On meeting His Holiness, he stated, “I have come to accompany
you in Your return to Shíráz.” [The Báb] refused. However much the
uncle insisted, He refused, stating, “I intend to remain in the ‘Atabát for
some time.”

Because his sister was looking forward to His Holiness’s arrival in
Shíráz, the uncle did not defer to this refusal. Through a message
transmitted by Hájí Siyyid Javád Karbalá’í, he appealed to the Siyyid
[Kázim] to convince His Holiness to return to Shíráz.

55 See Nabíl A‘zam, The Dawn-Breakers, p. 27, where Nabíl outlines slightly different
recollections of that day from Shaykh Hasan Zunúzí.

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

One day, the uncle himself went to the home of the Siyyid
[Kázim] and explained the situation as follows: “My Nephew lived in
Búshihr for six years before coming to the ‘Atabát. His mother has no
other child beside Him and deeply longs to see Him and plans to arrange
for His marriage. He has not consented to what I say, in bidding Him
return to Shíráz. Therefore, I beg of you to speak with Him, that He may
accompany me to Shíráz.” At first, the Siyyid replied, “Is it up to us to
interfere? Allow us the benefit of His presence for a while longer.” The
illustrious uncle responded, “As His mother is anticipating His arrival
and her approval is important as well, kindly tell Him to agree to return
to Shíráz.”

Eventually, the Siyyid transmitted the message to His Holiness [the
Báb], saying, “If it pleases You, return to Shíráz.” Because it was the
wish of the Siyyid, His Holiness agreed. In the company of His uncle, He
set out for Shíráz.56

The following is noted in Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, pp. 132–33, on the authority of

\[56\] 
Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, volume 3:

> Because of the insistence of the mother of the Báb and other

Marriage
There He rejoined His mother and relatives. After several months He
expressed the desire to return to the ‘Atabát. Hearing that His Holiness
entertained such considerations caused His mother to grow deeply
anxious, and with great urgency she spoke with her brother, Hájí Mírzá
Siyyid ‘Alí, about His marriage. Having spoken with the illustrious
consort, Khadíjih-Sultán Bagum, daughter of the late Áqá Mírzá ‘Alí and
a paternal cousin of the Báb’s mother, the arrangements for the wedding
ceremony were made. The wedding57 took place on Friday, the
eighteenth of Rajab AH 1258 [25 August 1842] in the presence of an
assemblage of the merchants, the noblemen, and the ‘ulamá of Fárs.58

And since the appointed time for His Manifestation was near, He
did not travel anywhere, but prayers and verses in Arabic and expositions
on [divine] sciences continually flowed from His pen.

> return by myself to Shíráz.” A few days later, the Khál returned to his
> native city and left the Báb in Karbalá. However, it was not long
> thereafter that He, too, returned to Shíráz.

57 As customary on such occasions, the wedding consisted of two separate

celebrations, one for the men and the other for the women. The men gathered in
the house of the Báb’s uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ‘Alí, while the women gathered in
the residence of Khadíjih Bagum’s father, which house was next door. The wedding
was conducted by Shaykh Abú-Turáb, the Imám-Jum‘ih (A.Q. Afnán, private
communications, August 1992).
58 A copy of the Báb’s marriage certificate provides the same date, see Balyúzí, The

Báb page opposite 80, and Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, pp. 158–61. The Báb refers to His
wedding as follows: “O concourse of Light! Hear My call from the point of Fire in this
ocean of snow-white water on this crimson earth. Verily, I am God, besides Whom
there is no other God. On the exalted throne a beloved noble woman, bearing the
same name [Khadíjih] as the beloved of the First Friend [the Prophet Muhammad],
was wedded to this Great Remembrance; and verily, I caused the angels of Heaven
and the denizens of Paradise, on the day of the Covenant, to bear witness, in truth, to
God’s Remembrance” (The Báb, Qayyúmu’l-Asma’, Surih of Qarábat [The Chapter of
Kinship], quoted in Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, pp. 7–8).

Ahmad, the Báb’s Son
After a year, that is in AH 1259 [1843], God granted Him a son who
died at birth. Before his birth, [the Báb] had prophesied, “The child is a
boy named Ahmad, but it is not his destiny to live.” The child was
buried in the Bíbí Dukhtarán cemetery of Shíráz.59 My paternal
grandmother, [Zahrá Bagum], who was the sister of Khadíjih Bagum,
related for me the details surrounding the child’s birth:

> [p. 40] The delivery of the child was very difficult, to the
> point that several times we lost all hope for the mother’s
> recovery. During the final surge of the labor pains, the
> mother of His Holiness went to Him. He asked her, “Has
> she delivered?” to which she responded negatively. [The
> Báb] then took a small mirror that lay by His side, penned a
> prayer and a talisman on the face of the mirror, gave it to
> His mother, [saying that she should] take it to His wife and
> hold it before her face. She took the mirror and held it
> before [Khadíjih Bagum]. As her gaze fell upon the mirror,
> instantly the lifeless child was delivered, and the mother
recovered.60

The Báb’s mother then returned to His presence and

59 Thus named since the tomb of Bíbí Dukhtarán is located there. For further details,
consult Fasa’i, Fársnámih Násirí, vol. 2, p. 1131.
60 The following passage from The Báb, Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’, Surih Qarábih, is addressed

to Khadíjih Bagum (cited in Balyúzí, Khadíjih Bagum, pp. 8–9, edited slightly below): “O
well-beloved! Prize thou highly the grace of the Great Remembrance for it cometh
from God, the Loved One. Thou shalt not be a woman like unto others, if thou
obeyest God in the Cause of Truth, the Most Great Truth. Know thou the great
bounty conferred upon thee by the Ancient of Days, and take pride in being the
consort of the Well-Beloved, Who is loved by God, the Most Great. Sufficient unto
thee is this glory, which cometh unto thee from God, the All-Wise, the All-Praised. Be
patient in all that God hath ordained concerning the Báb and His family. Verily, thy
son, Ahmad, is with Fátimih [the Prophet Muhammad’s daughter], the Sublime, in the
sanctified Paradise.” Also, see Balyúzí, Khadíjih Bagum, p. 9, for another mention by the
Báb of his son Ahmad, in Suratu’l-‘Abd of the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’.

The wife of the Báb recounted for me:

> One night I dreamt that there was a fearsome male lion in

> The beast dragged me around the courtyard two and a half
> times. I woke up, profoundly alarmed and trembling with

Declaration of the Báb
It proceeded thus until finally the declaration of the Báb took place on
the eve of Friday, the fifth day of Jamádíyu’l-Avval AH 1260 [23 May
1844], two hours and eleven minutes into the night.62 There is a
magnificent story of these wonderful events related by the wife of the
Báb as follows:

> The practice of His Holiness was that each day He would
> return home about an hour after the sunset and commence
> devotions, the chanting of the names of God, and writing.
> About three hours into the night He would have the evening
> meal and would retire about four hours past sunset. In the

> washing, would perform His ablutions and then proceed to

61 See Nabíl A‘zam, The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 76–77, for a brief reference to this
incident and a purported prayer by the Báb marking the passing of His son.
62 The exact time and date of the Báb’s declaration is given in the Persian Bayán 2:7.

It was thus that the first woman to believe in Him was the
illustrious wife of the Báb, [Khadíjih Bagum], and among the men of this
family [the Afnán], it was the martyred uncle, [Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ‘Alí,]
and among the ‘ulamá it was Akhúnd Mullá Husayn Bushrú’í, the Bábu’l-
Báb, whose story will be recounted next.

The Evidence Presented to Akhúnd Mullá Husayn in Shíráz and
How He Attained [to the Faith]66
65 See Balyúzí, Khadíjih Bagum, pp. 10–13, for a different rendering. In Kitáb Fihrist,
the Báb states that the first descent of Spirit on Him was on 15th of the third month
of AH 1260 [3 April 1844]. From this it is possible to infer that the event described
by Khadíjih Bagum occurred on that date.
66 The section pertaining to Mullá Husayn correlates closely with the narrative of Siyyid

Husayn Hamadání (see Táríkh-i Jadíd, pp. 35–39), which is purported to be based on

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

After the passing of Siyyid [Kázim Rashtí], who was a harbinger of this
blessed Manifestation, the Akhúnd [Mullá Husayn] was afflicted with
great perturbation and restlessness. Together with a group of fellow-
students, who numbered more than forty, he undertook a period of
meditation. The group included Áqá Mírzá [Siyyid] Muhammad-‘Alí
Barfurúshí,67 Mullá ‘Alí Bastámí, Akhúnd Mullá ‘Abdu’l-Jalíl Khú’í, Mírzá
‘Abdu’l-Hádí, Mírzá Muhammad-Hádí, Áqá Siyyid Hasan Yazdí, Mullá
Hasan Bajistání, Mullá Bashír, Mullá Báqir Turk, and Mullá Ahmad
Abdal—all of them learned men who were expecting the manifestation
of the Promised One. Details related to each one of them are captured in
the historical narratives, and our intention is only to recount the events
of Fárs.

After a period of forty days of ascetic observance in the Masjid
Kufih and Masjid Sahlih, the Akhúnd [Mullá Husayn] established a pact
with his companions that if any one of them should hear the Call of the
Truth, he would inform the others at once. Feeling himself drawn
towards Shíráz, he set out.

Because he had been acquainted with His Holiness [the Báb]
during His time in the ‘Atabát, when he arrived in Shíráz he desired [p.
50] a meeting and inquired where His Holiness lived. He wished to pass
the few days he would remain in Shíráz in His home. [Locating the Báb’s
House], he knocked at the door, and His Holiness Himself came and
opened the door. He warmly greeted and welcomed the Akhúnd, and
expressed great kindness and affection. Together they proceeded to the
upper room that served as the guestroom. [The Báb] said, “All day I

and captured in the history of Hájí Mírzá Jání of Káshán. The present translator has
not been able to determine if a copy of Mírzá Jání’s valuable history was in the
possession of the early Afnán family. However, it is known that Mírzá Jání’s original
text, which is about 80 or pages long, is extant and is in the possession of a non-Bahá’í
in Tihrán. Although he did not allow his precious manuscript to be copied, because of
his longstanding friendship with Fádil Mázandarání he permitted the latter to examine
this document, and he certified its authenticity. See Nabíl A‘zam, The Dawn-Breakers,
pp. 52–66, for Nabíl’s moving, though very different, description of the Báb’s
declaration.
67 Quddús had returned to his native town some months prior to Siyyid Kázim’s

passing; see Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 3, pp. 405–7.

have felt disinclined to go to the caravansary.68 Evidently this was
because of your arrival.”

After they had exchanged the customary inquiries and pleasantries,
tea was served, and the Host enjoyed it with the Akhúnd [Mullá Husayn].
After showing him the courtesies due to a guest, the Host asked about
the teachings and doctrines, the station and character of Shaykh [Ahmad]
and Siyyid [Kázim]. Mullá Husayn replied, “Whatever the topic under
discussion, their whole focus was the Traditions and sayings based on
the glad tidings of the manifestation of the Promised One.” The Báb
then asked, “You, the Shaykhís, have an essential doctrine that, after the
passing of the late Siyyid, there must be someone else who assumes his
title. It is now five months since his death. After him, who is the leader
of the cause?” “As yet,” [Mullá Husayn] replied, “we have recognized no
one. After him, no successor is specified. Rather, we anticipate the
Author of the Cause, Whose advent is expected by all, to appear.” “What
manner of man,” He asked, “must the Author of the Cause be?” The
Akhúnd pondered for a moment and then enumerated a certain number
of the spiritual and physical69 characteristics of the expected Person. “Do
you observe these in Me?” As Mullá Husayn had not observed any signs
of knowledge during his Host’s residence in Karbalá and knew that He
had not studied with the deceased teachers, responded, “I do not see any
of these qualities in you.” His Holiness did not respond to this.

After a while, [Mullá Husayn] observed several books in a small
niche. Examining one of them, he found it to be a commentary on the
Surih Baqara.70 After reading a little, he saw that it was a commentary
like no other. He was astonished and asked who the author might be. “A
mere youthful beginner,” He answered, “who has much other
knowledge and attainments, in addition to this.” Again, he asked who
and where the writer was. “You see Him.” Mullá Husayn did not
apprehend His meaning, “You see Him.” He read another page, where it
was written, “the explanation of the essence of the essence.” Considering
68 Mírzá Habíbu’lláh adds parenthetically: The Báb’s place of business was at the
custom building, known as the caravansary.
69 The original Arabic phrase literally means “theoretical and practical.”
70 See, Lawson, “The Qur’án Commentary of Sayyid ‘Alí Muhammad, the Báb.” For

copies of manuscripts see, MacEoin, The Sources for Early Bábí Doctrine and History.

this an error, he stated, “It should be, ‘the explanation of the essence’”
He answered, “It is, ‘the explanation of the essence of the essence.’ What
can I say! The Author of this commentary writes masterfully and with
utmost authority. Consider the passage attentively.” This time, the
Akhúnd read more closely and realized that the phrase, “exposition of
the essence of the essence,” was correct as it was written. He said, “I am
tired. You read some more, and I will listen.” His Holiness read for a
time, and then with the customary haughtiness of an Akhúnd, Mullá
Husayn said, “It is enough. That was sufficient. Do not trouble Yourself
any further.”

Mullá Husayn enjoyed lunch and then rested for a while. In the
late afternoon, His Holiness had invited several merchants and Shaykhí
‘ulamá to drink tea and meet the Akhúnd. [In the course of the
conversation,] it was agreed that the next morning they would all gather
at Masjid Ilkhání where the Akhúnd would deliver a lecture.

The group gathered, as appointed, in the mosque. When the
Akhúnd [Mullá Husayn] wanted to start his discourse, he found that in
place of eloquent expression and clear explanations, he had become
tongue-tied, to the extent that he lost all power of speech. Filled with
amazement, he thought, “this is so contrary to custom and nature, it
must have some purpose,” and he wondered “who is exercising this
secret control, and what might be his object in rendering me mute and in
such state of ecstasy that, in this gathering, I am like one who has been
transported in spirit?” [p. 55]. Such was his powerlessness, and so strong
the astonishment and emotion which took possession of him, that he
was not able to speak on any topic, and he cancelled the meeting and
returned to his lodgings, deeply bewildered.

The next day when he wished to deliver his lecture, he found
himself even more mute and devoid of ready knowledge than the
previous day. There was nothing he could do but apologize to the
audience.

The same happened on the third day. On this last occasion, he
departed from the mosque in a state of utmost misery and perplexity.
The Exalted One, noting Mullá Husayn’s despondency, told the rest of
their friends to go to their own houses, while he took Mullá Husayn,
with his consent, to His own home.

When they arrived at His Sacred House, after a short rest, the Báb
said, “By what proofs and signs of his station, can you recognize the
Author of the Cause, and by what proof can you pass from distraction
and wandering in the valley of search to recognizing the Beloved and
have complete confidence in the guidance He gives?” Mullá Husayn
answered, “By scientific writings and by the Exalted Point which is the
well-spring and center of all the knowledge of past and future prophets
and saints.” “Do you perceive these qualities in Me?” He inquired,
“What if I were so endowed with such attributes?” Upon hearing this,
Mullá Husayn was deeply perturbed, and said, “That You are devout,
godly, and holy of life, is true; but innate knowledge and infinite wisdom
are the only entry and evidence of this most exalted Station.” At this
comment, His Holiness was silent for while as though in wonder, while
Mullá Husayn thought to himself, “What idea can this devout and
sincere Youth be harboring that He so persistently introduces this topic,
although he has no education? I must at all events ask some questions of
His honored Person which He has never heard discussed and cannot
answer, so that He may be turned aside from His vain imaginings.”

Therefore, he presented to His Holiness a question which
appeared to him very difficult to resolve, and which he had always had in
mind during the lifetime of the late Siyyid [Kázim], but had never found
an opportunity of propounding it in such wise as to have the difficulty
removed in a satisfactory manner. Without hesitation, his Host provided
a full and sufficient answer. Mullá Husayn was filled with amazement.
He asked another difficult question, which his Host again answered
comprehensively and conclusively. Mute with astonishment, [Mullá
Husayn] reflected to himself, “Is not this Youth Who but a few days ago
did not correctly read the Commentary on the Surih Baqara? How is it
that He has now become the source and well-spring of all the sciences of
the past?” All manners of thoughts filled his being.

All of a sudden, he observed His Holiness anew: he was sitting in a
most dignified and majestic attitude, the left hand laid on the left knee
and the right hand over it. He began to utter most wondrous verses
containing answers to whatever question passed through Mullá Husayn’s
mind, until many verses had been revealed from the Fount of Divine

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

Revelation. During this entire period, Mullá Husayn waited anxiously for
Him to conclude, so strong was the fear and awe that possessed him.

At length He ceased, and [Mullá Husayn], in the extremity of
terror, rose up to flee, as some delinquent might flee from a mighty
sovereign. He asked permission to take his leave, but His Holiness
responded, “Remain seated! Where are you going? Anyone who beholds
you in this state would think you had lost your mind.” Constrained by
His bidding, he could do nothing but sit again, while His Holiness
withdrew to the private section of the House.

During His absence, the Akhúnd [Mullá Husayn] was prey to most
anxious thoughts. Care for worldly interests and the possibility of
opposition from divers quarters, the need for caution and prudence, all
passed through his mind. However, he realized that in the presence of
the Lord, he could not be insincere, nor offer excuses and objections. [p.
60] He saw no way out save confession and acceptance. He was greatly
perturbed, agitated, and troubled beyond all measure.

An hour later, contrary to His practice on other days, the Báb
Himself brought in the tea, seated Himself near Akhúnd [Mullá Husayn],
and showered him with most gracious expressions. He poured tea [for
Mullá Husayn] and handed him the cup, but the honored Akhúnd,
remained as one distraught and so amazed that he again asked
permission to depart. “You are still in a state of extreme bewilderment,”
[the Báb] informed him, “though you are not yourself aware of it.
Anyone who saw you in this state, would think you were possessed.”

After an hour, however, when he had regained his composure,
[Mullá Husayn] was permitted to take his leave.71

71The date of the Báb’s Declaration is fixed in the Persian Bayán 6:13 and 2:7, “And
from the moment when the Tree of the Bayán appeared until it disappeared is the
Resurrection of the Apostle of God, as is divinely foretold in the Qur’án; the
beginning of which was when two hours and eleven minutes had passed on the eve
of the fifth of Jamádíyu’l-Avval, AH 1260 [22 May 1844], which is the year of 1270
of the Declaration of the Mission of Muhammad” (translation in Selections from the
Writings of the Báb, p. 107). In a Tablet in honor of Mírzá Qábil of Ábádih, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá specifies this date as Kamál (8th) of Azamat; see Ishráq-Khávarí, Gangínih
Hudúd va Ahkám, p. 426.

On the occasion of the next visit, [Mullá Husayn] was shown a
commentary that the Báb had written on the Hadíth-i Jariyyih.72 He read
it and recalled that the late Siyyid [Kázim] had stated when he was alive
that the Proof Who was to appear would compose a full explanation of
this Tradition. Now Mullá Husayn saw his Promised manifest before
him. Moreover, he remembered that one day, when he was alone with
the late Siyyid [Kázim] in the library, in the course of conversation, he
[Mullá Husayn] had asked why the Surih Yúsuf [Joseph] of the Qur’án is
titled the Ahsanu’l-Qisas [the Best of Stories], to which the late Siyyid had
replied that it was not then the proper occasion for explaining the
reason. This incident remained concealed in his mind.

Now His Holiness said, “Mullá Husayn, do you recall inquiring
once of the late Siyyid, why the Surih Yúsuf is called the Ahsanu’l-Qisas,
and how he replied that the proper occasion for explaining this had not
yet come? The time for this explanation has now arrived.” Then He
showed [Mullá Husayn] a commentary on this Surih revealed from the
Most Exalted Pen. On reading it, the eminent Akhúnd attained the shore
of faith and prostrated himself in gratitude to God.73
72 Ishráq-Khávarí, Kitáb Muhadhirat, p. 14, notes that Jariyyih was a daughter of
Khadíjih, the wife of Muhammad. For a discussion of this Tradition of the
Handmaiden attributed to Imám Ja‘far Sádiq, see Kulayni, al-Usul min al-Kafi, vol. 1, pp.
95–96. See also Rieu, Catalogue of the Persian Manuscripts in the British Museum, vol. 1, p.

\[30\] 73 In the course of the first section of the Báb, Kitáb Panj Sha’n (the Book of Five

Modes), p. 9, revealed on the sixth anniversary of His declaration, the Báb describes
the night of His declaration in the language of prayer:

> In the name of God. There is no God but God. Sanctified art Thou, O
> God, My God. I testify that at an hour such as this, Thou hast bestowed
> honor and exaltation, glory and loftiness upon this night and hast
> sanctified it above all other nights through Thy Manifestation. This is
> the hour of the appearance of the Point of Bayán, Who is the sign of
> Thy dawning, the countenance of Thy morn of eternity, the evidence of
> Thy unity, the manifestation of Thy oneness, the confirmation of Thy
> loftiness, the signifier of Thy holiness, and the very essence of the
> divinity of Thy kingdom. Sanctified and exalted art Thou, that thou hast
> glorified this hour by creating whatsoever is within the Bayán and by

Conversion of Mullá Sádiq Khurásání
Mullá Husayn said, “During our stay at the Masjid Kufih and Masjid
Sahlih prior to dispersing [in search of the Promised Qá’im], my
companions and I established a pact that whichever of us first heard the
Call of Truth would inform the others. One in particular, Akhúnd Mullá
Sádiq [known as] Muqaddas Khurásání, proceeded towards Isfahán and
is now in that city. Please instruct me to go to Isfahán and to inform him
so that he, too, may attain the station of faith.” “There is no harm in
that,” the Báb replied, “however, it must be conditioned upon several
things.” “Whatever is Your command,” [Mullá Husayn] responded, “I
will instantly and faithfully obey.”

The Báb then revealed a detailed commentary on one of the
shorter Surihs of the Qur’án and entrusted it to the honored Akhúnd
Mullá Husayn, instructing him, “Take this commentary with you to
Isfahán. After you have renewed your acquaintance with the Akhúnd
[Mullá Sádiq Muqaddas], first ask if, during his travels, he has heard of,
or met, anyone who advanced a claim to be the Promised One? Should
he respond that he has neither met a claimant nor heard of such a call,
ask if he himself is putting forth a claim. Should he present one, he must
confirm it by means of divine verses, in the way that you have witnessed.
Only if he states that he has no claim of his own are you to present him

> threshold when the first person [i.e., Mullá Husayn] who has tasted the
> sweetness of Thy love in this Ridván attained to Me. He prostrated
> himself before Thy effulgence in this Paradise, and with him were the
> Letters of the Three. At such an hour, Thou didst cause Me to show
> Myself to him. Sanctified and exalted art Thou for enabling him [i.e.,

> will offer in the future, and such gratitude as none before hath offered
> and none will offer in the future, for the first who recognized My
> person, and for the recognition with which he recognized Me.

From this passage it is not clear whether the three travel companions of Mullá Husayn
also attained the presence of the Báb that very night, or on a later occasion.

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

with this commentary, without identifying its Author, as he himself must
discern [the Source of Revelation].”

Mullá Husayn proceeded to Isfahán in accordance with the Báb’s
instructions and upon arrival, was reunited with Mullá Sádiq. “O
honored Akhúnd,” he asked him, “after we separated, did you meet any
claimant or hear any call?” “I have encountered no one, and heard no
call,” he replied. “Do you suspect any qualities in yourself, which could
serve as evidence of some exalted station?” Deeply puzzled, Mullá Sádiq
rejoined, “Have you gone mad? You and I are of no account. The One
who raises a call must possess innate knowledge. Have you lost your
rational faculties, that you ask such a question?”

Upon being certain of Mullá Sádiq’s position, [p. 65] in accordance
with the Báb’s wish, he presented the commentary to him. After reading
a little of it, Mullá Sádiq seized the hem of Mullá Husayn’s garment,
demanding, “Who wrote this commentary? The Author of these words
is certainly the Truth. Where is He, and Who is He?” Refusing to answer
his question directly, [Mullá Husayn] said “I am not permitted to say; you
must discern it for yourself.” In the face of [Mullá Sádiq’s] insistence, he
remained adamant.

Soon the darkness of dusk fell, and supper was served. Afterwards,
the honored Mullá Husayn retired, satisfied in the knowledge that he had
carried out the mission entrusted him in its totality.74

74 Mírzá Habíbu’lláh has added the following marginal note in his own hand: “Áqá
Mírzá ‘Alí-Muhammad, the illustrious son of Mullá Muhammad-Sádiq Muqaddas
related for me the following description which he had heard from his honored father:
‘No matter how I implored Mullá Husayn [to divulge the name of Him Who claimed
to be the promised Manifestation], he refused and would only state that it was
forbidden for him to do so and that I must seek Him independently. Disappointed by
this response, I proceeded to the room set aside for devotions and performed my
ablutions. I spread the prayer mat and began my supplications. I entreated with such
earnestness that the tears pouring from my eyes dampened the prayer mat. In the
midst of such contemplation and in a state of near-unconsciousness, I beheld the
Young Siyyid that I had met in the gathering of late Siyyid [Kázim Rashtí]. He stood
over me saying, ‘What do you desire? If you seek Faith, it stands apparent and
manifest.’ This experience was repeated twice before dawn. After the third occurrence
of this vision, I came to the room where Mullá Husayn was resting. I woke him and
said, ‘Mullá Husayn, I have discovered the identity of the Master of this Cause. It must

The story of Mullá Sádiq and the manner of his recognition is well
loved and is no doubt related thoroughly in narratives of the history of
Isfahán. As such, this servant will not add to the burden of the reader.

In short, after achieving certitude, Mullá Sádiq together with
several others proceeded to Shíráz so that they would attain the blessed
presence [of the Báb]. Upon arrival in Shíráz, however, they learned that
His Holiness had departed on His journey to Mecca.

The honored Akhúnd Mullá Sádiq and his companions began to
propagate the news of the Revelation, particularly in the Masjid Báqir-
Ábád. Ascending the pulpit, they would present proofs to the people.
This matter was reported to the ‘ulamá, who consulted [on the matter].
By order of [the Governor] Husayn Khán, the Ajúdán-Báshí, known as
Sáhib-Ikhtíyár, those illustrious personages were seized, beaten with
sticks, their beards burnt, their noses pierced and a rope passed through
the incision. From dawn to dusk, the executioner paraded them through
the bazaar and received a sum of money from each shopkeeper and
artisan.

At sunset, those oppressed ones, being extremely hungry and
fatigued, and having been severely beaten and injured, were expelled
from the city.75

The Arrival of Quddús
The affirmation of faith of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí Barfurúshí, who
was surnamed Quddús: He was among the ‘ulamá and learned divines
famous for piety and godliness, and because of his inner spirituality and
purity, no sooner had he heard this Call than he set out for Shíráz to
investigate the matter.76

be none other than that same Shirází Siyyid that we met in the ‘Atabát.’ Mullá Husayn
responded affirmatively.”
75 A similar description is provided in Nabíl A‘zam, The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 144–48

relating to the events that befell Quddús, Mullá Sádiq, and Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar
Ardistání subsequent to the Báb’s return from pilgrimage.
76 In his writings, Quddús describes his vision of the Báb some time prior to the

Latter’s declaration that enabled him to recognize the promised Manifestation. He
further states that on the first day of Jamádíyu’l-Avval [18 May 1844], he left his native

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

Upon arrival at that city and meeting the Báb in the street, without
seeking proofs or signs, nor evidence or deductions, he instantly attained
complete certitude. From the moment of that meeting, he ranked among
the foremost disciples, manifesting unsurpassed qualities, displaying all-
embracing virtues. The details related to his glorious life, his magnificent
services, and his martyrdom are described in depth in the history of the
events of Fort Tabarsí and as such will not be repeated in these pages.77

The Báb’s Blessed Journey to Mecca in Sha‘bán 126078
The blessed and heavenly pilgrimage group that included the Báb left for
Mecca—an undertaking that completed the proof for all who dwell on
earth. Among those who were in His blessed presence were the late Hájí
Abú’l-Hasan, father of Áqá Mírzá Báqir Khán Dihqán, whose goodly
qualities are beyond any description; Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí,
surnamed Quddús; and Hájí Mubárak, a slave with a pure nature and
pleasant disposition who had been purchased by the Báb when He was a
merchant in Búshihr.79 They set out from Shíráz. That year a large
contingent of the city’s inhabitants, including many of the ‘ulamá and
merchants, were also travelling to Mecca.80 Shaykh Háshim (a brother of

town for Shíráz. For a detailed discussion of the life and writings of Quddús, see the
present translator’s forthcoming book on this subject, Quddús: Life and Writings.
77 Among the various eyewitness accounts of Shaykh Tabarsí, the most detailed

were recorded by Lutf-‘Alí Mírzá Shirází and Mír Abú-Talib Shahmírzádí. With the
Bahá’í World Centre’s consent, the present translator is completing a translation of
the latter account.
78 August–September 1844. The Báb in one of His sermons, known as Khutbih

Jaddiyyih, gives the date of His departure from Shíráz as 26 Sha‘bán (10 September
1844); see, Ishráq-Khávarí, Kitáb Muhadhirat, pp. 729–31.
79 The Báb provides a brief outline of His hajj journey in the Persian Bayán 4:18; for

translation see Selections from the Writings of the Báb, pp. 89–91. See also the Persian
Bayán 4:16 and 6:17.
80 From Búshihr, the Báb sent the following letter to His wife in Shíráz (Text

quoted in Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, pp. 166–67, the original letter is displayed in the
International Bahá’í Archives in Haifa):
O the best of Protectors! In the Name of God, the Exalted.
My sweet life! May thou be guarded by God!

the Imám-Jum‘ih of Shíráz, Shaykh Abú-Turáb) who was much hated
and very quarrelsome, was also among this group of pilgrims.

That year, pilgrims from all corners of the world where Muslims
live were proceeding towards Mecca, for according to the Islamic
teachings, whenever the 10th day of Dhi’l-Hajjih, which is the observance
of the ‘Id-i Adha [the Festival of Sacrifice], falls on a Friday, that
pilgrimage is called the ‘Greater Pilgrimage,’ and that is the year of the
Manifestation [of the Promised One]. According to a well-known
Tradition, [on such an occasion], the Qá’im will place His back against
the wall in the court of the Masjidu’l-Ahrám and will openly declare His
Cause.

At that time, journey by sea was most difficult and disagreeable, as
steam vessels did not operate in the Persian Gulf. It was necessary to go
by sailing ship, which made the voyage to Jaddih by sea a minimum of
three or four months. [p. 70] One day the late Hájí Abú’l-Hasan [who
had been a travel companion of the Báb] described his pilgrimage
journey to this servant, saying:

It was not because of sadness that I did not write sooner,

Nor was it due to My heart being sorrowed
Nay, My hand wrote thee,

But My tears washed away the words.

> God is My witness that I have been overcome with so much sorrow
> since our separation that it cannot be described. However, since we
> are all seized in the grasp of destiny, such has been decreed for us.
> May the Lord of the world, by the righteousness of the Five Near-
> Ones, ordain My return.
> It is now two days since we arrived in Búshihr. The temperature is
> extremely hot, but the Lord of creation will protect [us]. Apparently,
> our ship will sail this very month. May God watch over Us, out of His

Ahang Rabbani, The Bábís of Nayríz: History and Documents.
82  According to the Abjad system, ghars has a numerical value of
(1000+200+60=)1260, hence signifying the year of the appearance of the Báb.

The news of this event was noised abroad in Shíráz. Prior to the
voyage to Mecca not all of the city’s inhabitants were aware of this Call.
Some had heard it and recognized its truth, while others had not heard
the claim, and yet others were saying, “These words are imputed to Him,
and there is no truth in them.” After the news of Mecca had reached
Shíráz and His exact utterances were written and disseminated, the
whole of the people were now aware and fully informed, and no room
remained for doubt and vacillation for anyone.84

Return from Búshihr
The time was nigh for the arrival of His Holiness in Shíráz.85 Shaykh
Abú-Háshim, [brother of Imám-Jum‘ih,] wrote a most provocative
83 Qur’án 2:285.
84 See Nabíl A‘zam, The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 130–41, for further details on the Báb’s
hajj journey.
85 The Báb gives the following chronology of His travels in a Khutbih [Sermon]

(Ishráq-Khávarí, Kitáb Muhádirát, pp. 729–31):
Left Shíráz           10 September 1844
Arrived Búshihr      19 September 1844
Left the port         2 October 1844
Reached Mecca         12 December 1844
Hajj Completed        24 December 1844
Left Mecca            7 January 1845
Arrived Medina       16 January 1845

account to Shíráz, promoting mischief and raising the cry, “Our religion
is lost!” A great excitement was caused when his letter reached Shíráz. A
contingent of the ‘ulamá, such as Shaykh Husayn Zalim [the tyrant],
known as the Názimu’sh-Shari‘ah; Akhúnd Mullá Muhammad-‘Alí
Mahallátí; Shaykh Mahdí Kajawví; and a score of others went before
Husayn Khán, who was at that time the governor-general of Shíráz.
They complained, “The Siyyid Who publicly claimed [the station of] the
Qá’imiyyat and the Bábiyyat86 in Mecca will shortly arrive [in Shíráz], and
you must join with the adherents of Islam in quenching this fire and
silencing this Call, so it is kept under control.” Husayn Khán gave in to
the flattery of the clerics. When the Báb arrived at Búshihr, Husayn
Khán sent a mounted escort of several men to Búshihr to arrest His
Holiness and to return Him to Shíráz.

Late one afternoon, His Holiness was standing on an elevation by
the village of Dálakí,87 a distance of two days’ journey to Búshihr, when
the troops passed through that location. His Holiness instructed Hájí
Mubárak, “Go quickly and ask the soldiers where they are going and
what their mission is.” In accordance with His command, Hájí Mubárak
approached the soldiers and asked where they were going. The soldiers,
being argumentative, said, “Where we are going and what we are doing is
none of your business, black man!” Hájí Mubárak returned to His
presence and informed Him, “The horsemen refused to say what their
mission is.” The Báb said, “Go and tell them to come to Me.” Hájí
Mubárak went to the soldiers and said, “My Master asked that you
should be so kind as to come, so that we can make your acquaintance.”

A certain Aslán Khán, who was older and wiser than the rest,
came back with Hájí Mubárak and attained His blessed presence. He was
asked, “Where are you going and what mission have you been given?”
The soldier again refused to divulge their orders. The Báb said, “No

reason to conceal it: your mission is to take the Siyyid-i Báb to Shíráz. [p.
80] Do not trouble yourselves. I stand ready. If you went on to Búshihr
according to your orders and passed this village by, you would not
accomplish your mission.” The official looked closely at His
Countenance and noted all the signs that he had been given in Shíráz to
identify Him and realized that this was the Siyyid in person. He returned
to his companions and reported what had transpired, which caused them
all to exclaim with wonder, “If a man is sought by the government or the
people, it is only natural for him to flee the officers sent to take him
under guard from one place to another. How is it then that with the
utmost courage and firmness this Personage has come forward,
informing us that He is undoubtedly the object of our quest? Of a
certainty He must be of the true!”

The valor of the Báb awakened the consciousness of the men.

They attained His blessed presence, and His Holiness showered upon
them His immense kindness and benevolence. He instructed Hájí
Mubárak to serve them the supper he had prepared, as these men had
been traveling and were hungry and tired. Hájí Mubárak served the same
quantity of food that he had prepared for two persons and brought it.
The men saw that there was very little food and that it would not even
suffice one of them, but they sat to dine and ate their fill. This
experience deepened their wonder. In the course of the journey they
witnessed many such miracles.88

With the utmost respect and dignity, the men accompanied His
Holiness to Shíráz and told their friends and acquaintances of what they
had observed and of the grandeur and majesty of the Báb.

Return of the Exalted One from Mecca to Shíráz in AH 1261 [1845]
In all events, after the true ‘ulamá, who were the heralds of the
Manifestation, had raised the news of the Cause throughout the realm
and it had been particularly widely reported in Shíráz, His Holiness

88In a Tablet dated 24 Jamádíy’th-Thání AH 1261/30 June 1845 to His uncle, Hájí
Mírzá Siyyid ‘Alí, the Báb mentions the esteem that the horsemen showed Him
during this journey (A.Q. Afnán, private communications, August 1993).

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

returned from Mecca in AH 1261. When He proclaimed His Cause
publicly in Mecca, the news spread even further than before. This is
reported in all the histories of the Cause and will be recounted briefly
here as well.

In short, His Holiness arrived in Shíráz in the company of the
guards. They proceeded directly to the governor’s office and reported
their arrival. They recounted all that had occurred—how they had met
Him at the first staging-post at Dálakí and what they had seen with their
own eyes along the way—to the Nizamu’d-Dawlih. Husayn Khán
ordered that His Holiness should be detained. This news spread fast.
Some ignorant people with a reputation for knowledge were present and
began to torment and mock [the Báb]. They attributed to Him what was
applicable to themselves. Shaykh Husayn Zálim tormented His Holiness
with his own hand.

When the maternal uncle [of the Báb] and the revered mother of
His Holiness were informed of these events, they were deeply perturbed.
The latter went to her brother, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ‘Alí, and began to
lament and bewail [over the condition of her Son].

The Báb’s maternal uncle departed for the governor’s office. On
meeting Husayn Khán, he said, “It is reported that His Holiness has
returned from the exalted city of Mecca, and His mother and other
members of His family have been awaiting His arrival. Why have you
detained Him? Is He not a descendant of the Prophet of God? Is there
no shame before His illustrious Ancestor?” Noting the forceful manner
in which the uncle defended Him, Husayn Khán replied, “If you will
mediate and serve as a guarantor that He will not go to meet with
anyone, that no one will be admitted to Him, and that He will not write
anything or share His writing with anyone, I will release Him.”

Because the illustrious uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ‘Alí, was respected
by the merchants and associated with reputable people, he responded, “I
associate with men from all strata of society, and His Holiness is my
Nephew [p. 85] and has returned from Mecca. Naturally, the people
want to see Him. How can I give my word, when He has come from
Mecca, to say that He may not see people?” Faced with irrefutable logic,
Husayn Khán responded, “For three days, people may come and go, but
on the fourth day, you are to close the door to all and allow no one to

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

visit your house.” Having given his surety on these terms, the uncle
brought His Holiness home with him.

[Upon the Báb’s arrival home], His mother and His blessed wife,
along with other friends and relatives, attained His honored presence,
and for three days all the believers and friends delighted in this union
and benefited from its immeasurable spiritual bestowal. Divine verses
were sent down like a continuous rain: all were recorded in His own
blessed Hand on large sheets of cashmere paper and bestowed upon the
visitors.

On completion of the three days, all access was denied to the
friends, and no one was permitted to attain the presence [of the Báb].
However, even if the Sun of Reality is covered by a sullen cloud of
formal restrictions, its radiance and effulgence shines ever more
apparent. Consequently, although to all appearances the believers were
denied access [to the Báb], they still continued to submit to Him their
questions and difficulties, and to receive replies, for it is incumbent on
the generous to answer him who asks, especially when the questions
refer to religious matters, and the demands are for guidance and
direction in the path of salvation. The result was that many people,
including people from the surrounding areas, came to inquire into the
matter, submitted their questions, and received full and satisfactory
answers, each according to his own capacity, so that they too were led to
believe.89

Arrival of Vahíd Dárábí
One of those who attained the presence [of the Báb] in Shíráz was the
honored Áqá Siyyid Yahyá Dárábí. His story is wonderful and amazing:
he was the illustrious son of Hájí Siyyid Ja‘far Kashfí, who has been
mentioned in the recollections of Hájí Abú’l-Hasan, in the section
pertaining to Mecca.

[Siyyid Yahyá Dárábí] was eminent among the mujtahids and
students of truth, gifted with supernatural faculties and an exalted

89This paragraph is congruent with the narrative of Siyyid Husayn Hamadání; see
Táríkh-i Jadíd, p. 203.

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

spiritual station, unrivalled in debate and investigation, no less than for
his austerity and piety. At that time he was in Tihrán. The late
Muhammad Sháh Qájár trusted him profoundly, to the extent that he
would not take any action or assign any task contrary to the permission
and the fatwa of Siyyid Yahyá. When the news of this Cause reached the
monarch’s ears, he summoned the honored Áqá Siyyid Yahyá and said,
“According to the information received at our court, a certain Personage
in Fárs has advanced a claim to the stations of Qá’imiyyat and Bábiyyat.
As you enjoy our utmost confidence, you must proceed at once to Fárs,
and fully investigate a matter of such universal purport. Send word to
our court regarding the truth or falsity of these claims, so that we may
know our civil and religious duties. You must depart with all haste, and
write a prompt report on this issue for us.” He provided for his
expenses, ordered that he be provided with a horse, and sent him on his
way to Shíráz.

Upon arrival at Shíráz he met with the honored Hájí Siyyid Javád
Karbalá’í, who was a scholar of divinity and wise in the wisdom of the
eternal. The two had been friends and associates in the ‘Atabát. Through
him, [Siyyid Yahyá] met with several other [Bábí] ‘ulamá and prominent
believers and, having explained the purpose of his investigation,
requested a meeting [with the Báb]. However, the summons was delayed
because of various obstacles. He spent the interval in examining some of
the revealed verses. Finding in them no ground for objection or denial,
he said in confidence to the honored Hájí Siyyid Javád, “These luminous
words and verses bear witness to the truth of the claim and leave no
room for doubt; yet were I permitted to behold some miracle or sign
beyond this, I would gain a fuller certitude and assurance.” [p. 90] That
illustrious person answered, “If we were to ask that Perfect Reality for
wonders and miracles, we would be like those who have seen a thousand
marvels more wonderful than the fabled cleaving of the moon, but are
so befuddled that they continue to seek light from a candle or lantern in
the full blaze of the radiant sun.”

In short, Áqá Siyyid Yahyá prepared a petition, requesting that a
commentary on the blessed Surih of Kawthar be revealed for his
edification. One night, about four hours after sunset, he himself took
this supplication to the Blessed House of the Báb and attained His

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

presence, presenting his request. [The Báb] instructed him to return at
dawn to receive the response to his request.

In the early dawn, as bidden, [Siyyid Yahyá] again attained His
presence and was given the response in the form of an unrivaled
commentary on the Surih of Kawthar extending to nearly five thousand
written verses.90 He returned with it to his own home. Then, astonished
by the number and quality of its luminous verses, on meeting the
honored Siyyid Javád Karbalá’í, he remarked, “I have beheld a marvel a
hundred-thousand-fold beyond what I have [previously] witnessed, for,
with all my learning and scholarship, I spent nine whole days in writing
one single page of questions containing not more than twelve lines. At
four hours into the night, I presented them myself, and at dawn, I
received such a response! I am astonished that these luminous verses, of
such eloquence and clarity of style, should be revealed and written down
during five or six hours of the latter part of the night, which is the time
for His rest and sleeping.”

As soon as Áqá Siyyid Yahyá had studied that most precious
proof, he prostrated himself in adoration, and attained certitude. After a
sojourn of some little while, during which the honor of an interview was
accorded him, he received permission to set out for Yazd, by way of
Bávanát and Marvast [Marv-Dasht], to proclaim the blessed Cause and
to teach the Faith there. The details of the occurrences in Yazd will
certainly be documented in the histories of that city. God willing, his
return from Yazd and the events of Nayríz will be narrated at the proper
place in this book.

The Báb’s Public Announcement at Masjid Vakíl
In all events, the enmity of enemies was now manifest in the utmost
degree, and they exerted many efforts to prevent the friends from
attaining the presence [of the Báb] and meeting with His Person.
However, the devotion of the believers and the grandeur of the Cause
withstood their onslaught, and the friends’ visits to His sacred presence
increased considerably in accordance with the verse, “Verily the devils

90   For comparison, the Qur’án is slightly more than 6,600 verses.

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

inspire their friends.”91 The honored opponents reported the events to
Husayn Khán [who issued an order for the arrest of the Báb], and on the
eve of 21 Ramadán [11 September 1846], over the neighbor’s wall, the
guards entered the House of His Holiness.

‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Khán, the Dárúghih, who was charged with
carrying out this order, arrived with several of his farrashes and noted
that His Holiness was alone in the dwelling. Deeply embarrassed,
‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Khán submitted, “Certain reports reached us that a
crowd had gathered at this location, and therefore we came to
investigate. However, since it is evident that no one is here, we take our
leave.” He then asked for a gratuity, to which [the Báb] responded,
“There is nothing here.” Insisting on receiving a prize, ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd
Khán seized the imported cashmere shawl that the Báb was wearing
around His waist and sliced it in the middle, taking half with him.

The Dárúghih thereupon went before Husayn Khán, telling the
latter that none were in the Báb’s House save He. However, the
mischievous elements, led by the ‘ulamá, continued to instigate sedition,
and as such Husayn Khán, the governor, sent his men to summon His
Holiness with His maternal uncle to the governor’s office. There,
Husayn Khán rebuked the illustrious uncle, roaring, “You guaranteed
that none would be associating [with the Báb], but you have acted
against your own written statement. Consequently, you must be
punished.” He then turned to the farrashes and spoke harshly and
contemptuously with them as well and instructed that sticks92 be
brought. The illustrious uncle, who was a greatly respected Siyyid and [p.
95] more than sixty years of age, was struck with sticks most severely,
and the Báb was struck in the face as well. Afterwards, a sum of money
was extracted from the victims, and [as the uncle was unable to walk] the
farrashes carried him over their shoulders to his house where he
remained injured in bed for a period of time.

His Holiness was subject to brutal treatment and imprisoned in
the house of ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Khán. For a while it passed thus. Once
again, the ‘ulamá assembled and went before Husayn Khán demanding

91   Qur’án 6:121.
92   Most likely it is meant bastinado.

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

that he must follow through and force the Siyyid-i Báb to be summoned
and compelled to recant His claim.

One afternoon all the ‘ulamá gathered in the Government House,
that is, the governor’s office, and consulted on the situation and
unanimously decided that His Holiness must be brought to Masjid Vakíl
where all of the city’s inhabitants, including such ranks as the ‘ulamá, the
merchants, the shopkeepers, and others would be present, and in that
assemblage He must be forced to withdraw His claim.

My brother, Hájí Mírzá Buzurg, and I were present once when the
late Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq Mu‘allim [teacher], who was a most
respected man and had witnessed the event of Masjid Vakíl, related
briefly that episode for the late ‘Andalíb. The details are as such:

> I was about twenty-five years old and had reached the age of
> being able to discern truth from falsehood. It was noised
> throughout the city that, on the request of the ‘ulamá, the
> authorities were inviting all inhabitants of Shíráz from every
> strata to gather in the Masjid Vakíl where the Siyyid-i Báb
> would renounce His claims. I went to the mosque as well
> and exerted particular effort to find a spot near [the pulpit]
> where I could behold Him and clearly hear His utterances
> and speech. From the morning of that day, rank upon rank
> of onlookers arrived at the mosque, and by three o’clock in
> the afternoon the entire courtyard, the cloisters, the roofs,
> and even the minarets of the mosque were thronged with
> people. The governor, the ‘ulamá, the merchants, and other
> dignitaries entered and sat in the cloisters, near the stone
> pulpit. (This is a pulpit carved out of one piece of marble
and has fourteen steps.)

I was sitting near the pulpit when a commotion was
> raised in the courtyard: “He is coming!” He entered through
> the cloister’s entrance accompanied by ten farrashes and
> ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Khán, the Dárúghih, and drew near the
> pulpit. The Báb was wearing a turban and an ‘abá and
> walked with such dignity, might, grandeur, and magnificence
> that it is truly indescribable. Such a multitude of people in

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

> attendance meant nothing to Him, and He heeded them not
in the least.

He said to the ‘ulamá and the governor, “What is your
> purpose in summoning Me to this place?” They responded,
> “The intention is that You should ascend this pulpit and
> repudiate Your false claim so that this fury and excitement
> may subside.” [The Báb] did not respond and ascended the
> pulpit where He stood on the third step. With great
> vehemence, Shaykh Husayn Zálim said, “Ascend to the top
> of the pulpit so everyone can see You and hear Your voice.”
> His Holiness ascended to the top of the pulpit and sat there.
> Suddenly, an absolute silence prevailed and not a whisper
> could be heard from the people, and it seemed as if not a
> soul was in that mosque. Everyone was listening most
attentively.

At first, with utmost majesty and sovereignty, He
> commenced recitation of an exquisite Arabic homily with
> absolute eloquence and clarity that lasted some half an hour.
> The entire concourse of people, high and low, learned and
> illiterate alike were in total rapture and listened with great
> fascination. People’s silence, caused agitation in Shaykh
> Husayn who said to the governor, “Have you summoned
> the Siyyid in the presence of these people to establish the
> validity of His Cause or to recant His false claim? He is
> casting a spell on the assemblage with His enchanting
> speech. Instruct Him to say what He was intended to say.
> What drivel is He uttering?” Husayn Khán, the Sáhib-
> Ikhtíyár, said [to the Báb], “Siyyid, state what they [i.e., the
> ‘ulamá] have told you to affirm, [p. 100] what is this idle
> chatter?” His Holiness remained silent for a moment and
> then uttered, “O People, know this well and be informed. I
> say unto you what My Grandfather, the Messenger of God,
> spoke twelve hundred and sixty years ago, and I do not
> speak what He spoke not. ‘What Muhammad made lawful
> remains lawful unto the Day of Resurrection, and what He
> forbade remains forbidden unto the Day of Resurrection.’

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

> In accordance with this Hadíth-i Marví from the Immaculate
> One, ‘Verily, the Qá’im will usher forth the Day of
Resurrection.’”

Having recited this Tradition, He then descended the
> pulpit. Many of those who had previously harbored enmity
> or malice, once having beheld Him, were guided aright and
repudiated their ways.

Shaykh Husayn Zálim, out of sheer hostility, raised his
> walking-stick to strike His Holiness in the head, when the
> late Mírzá Abú’l-Hasan Khán, the Mushíru’l-Mulk, who was
> a young man in those days, readily brought forward his
> shoulder to ward off the attack, and it was his shoulder that
> sustained the hit. Afterwards, Husyan Khán instructed that
> His Holiness once again be imprisoned in the home of
> ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Khán.

In short, the aforementioned Hájí [Mu‘allim], though not a
believer but an admirer [of the Báb], related this story to the late
‘Andalíb. His purpose was that [the Báb] on that occasion affirmed the
truth of His Cause and completed His proof before the concourse of
people.93

Fatwá Against the Báb
After His Holiness returned from the mosque and was placed under
house-arrest at the home of ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Khán, the entire body of the
‘ulamá assembled and fixed their seal on a fatwá decreeing the death of
His Holiness. Among those present who signed the document was
Shaykh Husayn Zálim, known as the Nazimu’sh-Shari‘ih, who was the
source of all sedition and the prime instigator of mischief. Others were
Shaykh Abú-Háshim, Shaykh Asadu’lláh, Shaykh Mihdí Kujúry, Mullá
Muhammad-‘Alí Mahallátí, and those like them. They wrote whatsoever
they wished and signed that paper.

93   See Balyúzí, The Báb, pp. 96–98, for a slightly different translation.

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

That congregation then proceeded to the home of the late Shaykh
Abú-Turáb,94 the Imám-Jum‘ih, who, despite their insistence and every
effort, had refused to attend their assemblage. Attaining the presence of
the Shaykh, they acquainted him with their purpose and presented the
document, requesting him to fix his seal on the paper as well so that the
matter of the Siyyid be concluded [and the Báb be slain]. Upon perusing
the fatwa and considering its content, the Shaykh, profoundly moved
with indignation, threw the paper to the ground and cried, “Have you
lost your faculties! Never will I sign such a paper, as I have no misgivings
whatsoever regarding the nobility, chastity, integrity, sagacity, piety, and
virtue of this Siyyid! In this Youth, I behold the ultimate manifestation
of Islamic and human attributes, as well as evidence of the highest
expressions of wisdom and rational reasoning. I see two possibilities:
Either He speaks truthfully, or He is, as you allege, a liar. If He speaks
genuinely, then I would be remiss to issue a fatwa against an honest and
trustworthy person. And should He, as you aver, be a liar and a perjurer,
which of us standing here can claim to have spoken only the truth in our
lives? Therefore, arise and leave this place, and do not conceive such
empty imaginings.” No matter how they pleaded, the late Shaykh Abú-
Turáb, may his station be exalted, refused to ratify the document with his
seal, and through this refusal, their efforts came to naught, their purpose
was frustrated, and their wish remained unfulfilled.

Departure for Isfahán
In short, at this time, for the warning and awakening of the neglectful
and the ignorant, the Ocean of Divine Wrath stirred forth, and a
grievous cholera epidemic fell upon Iran and raged with especial fury
over Shíráz. Great multitudes from all ranks, including nobles, peasants,
learned, illiterate, ministers, and subjects made haste to escape from this

94 A son of Shaykh Muhammad Záhid [pious] who had served as the Imám-Jum‘ih
of Shíráz after his father, Shaykh Abú-Turáb ranked as the foremost divine of the
city and was greatly loved and admired by the citizens. He lived for a few years
during the reign of Muhammad Sháh in Tihrán but eventually returned to Shíráz
where he passed away in 1855; see Bámdád, Sharh Hál Rijál Iran, vol. 1, p. 71.

12; pp. 91-127. (Reprinted with slight revisions at: http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com)

evident calamity. The first to retreat was Husayn Khán, the governor,
and then others followed from all ranks of society.

A large number died. It chanced that the two young sons of
‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Khán, the Dárúghih, fell ill of the cholera and came nigh
to death’s door. Their mother, deeply agitated, spoke harshly to her
husband, ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Khán, saying, “Their illness is because of your
evil doings towards this wronged Siyyid [p. 105] Who has been unjustly
imprisoned here. Through such negligence, you will bring ruin upon
yourself and the whole household. Let this innocent Siyyid leave.”
‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Khán besought the Báb, earnestly stating, “Depart for
wherever Your holy inclinations may lead You.” [The Báb] responded,
“Husayn Khán has fled from the city in the face of divine chastisement;
however, when he returns, you will be responsible [for My
whereabouts].” “It is I,” ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Khán pleaded, “who must
remain answerable to Husayn Khán as, because of my misdeeds, my
sons are now near death. After them, I wish not to live any longer in this
world.” He cried bitterly for the fate that had befallen him and
beseeched the intercession of His Holiness, Who prayed and responded
by handing him a sweet pomegranate and stating, “Have your sons eat
from this fruit.” After the lads had partaken of the pomegranate and full
recovery was theirs, ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Khán, having witnessed the
occurrence of this miracle, implored Him, “Do not tarry, even for one
hour, in this dwelling, I will not prevent Your departure in whatever
direction You will. And furthermore, I stand ready to offer whatever
service that Your Holiness may require.”

[The Báb] retired to His house, and there the family and kinsmen
came to visit Him. Later, in the company of Áqá Muhammad-Husayn
Ardistání, who was reckoned among the believers and among His close
companions, [the Báb] proceeded for the city of Isfahán.95 The events

95In the language of prayer, the Báb gives an outline of the events that had befallen
Him:

> Thou art aware, O My God, that since the day Thou didst call Me
> into being out of the water of Thy love till I reached fifteen years of
> age I lived in the land that witnessed My birth [Shíráz]. Then Thou
> didst enable Me to go to the seaport [Búshihr] where for five years I
> was engaged in trading with the goodly gifts of Thy realm and was

occurring in that land are indeed beyond all description and assuredly
have been recorded in the narratives pertaining to that city. For our
purposes, only the following note regarding the incidents of Isfahán
should suffice.

Upon arrival in the city of Isfahán, the late Manuchihr Khán, the
Mu‘tamidu’d-Dawlih,96 exalted be his station, came into the presence [of
the Báb] and immediately became a most ardent admirer. His Holiness
described some of the tyranny and injuries that He had previously
endured at the hand of Husayn Khán, adding, “When We departed from
Shíráz, cholera raged over the province of Fárs, and Husayn Khán
escaped with all deliberate speed from the city. I was made captive at the
home of ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Khán, but because of the epidemic and the fact
that his own sons fell victims to the illness, he released this Wronged-
One and of necessity asked that I leave. In so doing, he remarked, ‘Upon
Husayn Khán’s return, I will personally shoulder the responsibility.’
Surely, after the pandemic of cholera has been eradicated and quiet has
once again become the city’s norm, Husayn Khán will return and will
inquire after Me. As he is a wicked and ill-natured man, upon discovering
that I no longer reside within His grasp, he will injure my kinsmen and
family. My purpose is to ask your Excellency to petition Husayn Khán

that he may not disturb [My family].” As soon as this request was made
by his distinguished Guest, the late Mu‘tamidu’d-Dawlih wrote a detailed
letter to the governor-general of Fárs, with words to the effect that “the
Siyyid-i Báb is a guest in my abode in Isfahán, and I stand as His
protector. Should the government summon Him [to Tihrán for further
inquiry], I will personally deliver Him. You have no cause to harass His
family or inflict disturbance upon them.” This letter was sent to Shíráz
with a special envoy.

When the epidemic subsided to a prescribed degree, the people
who had fled the city returned forthwith, including Husayn Khán who
[as anticipated by the Báb] immediately inquired from ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd
Khán the whereabouts of His Holiness. The latter responded, “As the
epidemic raged uncontrollably throughout the land and my wife and
sons had fallen victim to the illness as well, I could no longer properly
minister His affairs and as such asked Him to retire to His own
dwelling.” Deeply angered by the turn of events, Husayn Khán
instructed ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Khán to proceed at once in company of ten
farrashes and search the home of His Holiness or wherever else He
might be and bring Him forthwith to the government-house.

Persecution of the Báb’s Family
As instructed, they proceeded immediately to the House of His Holiness
and, not finding Him there, proceeded to the home of His illustrious
uncle, [Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ‘Alí,] but were unable to locate the latter at
home either. [p. 110] They then proceeded to the residence of the late
Hájí Mírzá Abú’l-Qásim. The latter was a paternal cousin of the Báb’s
mother and a brother of the honored wife of the Báb, [Khadíjih Bagum,]
and at the time was the renowned standard-bearer of the family. My
maternal grandmother [Zahrá Bagum], who was the sister of the Báb’s
wife, related:

> My late brother, that is, Hájí Mírzá Abú’l-Qásim, was home
> suffering from cholera and resting in bed due to weakness
> caused by the illness, when some time before noon, there
> was a violent knock on our door. The entire household was

> deeply disturbed. Fírúz, our black, house-born servant, went
> to inquire who it was when suddenly and without warning,
> ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Khán, the Dárúghih, in the company of a
> number of farrashes and some other lewd characters entered
> our home and filled the courtyard. A most disturbing uproar
> ensued as they hurriedly searched the house for any trace of
> His Holiness and disappointed [in their inability to locate the
> Báb,] came to the room where my late brother was resting in
> bed due to his illness. The farrashes placed him on their
> shoulders and took him before Husayn Khán, the Sáhib-
Ikhtíyár.

Profoundly infuriated, the latter inquired callously,
> “Where lies the Siyyid-i Báb?” “I have been afflicted with
> cholera,” my brother replied, “and still suffer from the
> illness. As such, I do not know His whereabouts, nor do I
> have any news of Him.” Husayn Khán dealt with him most
> harshly and severely and finally he was granted fifteen days
> to either present His Holiness or to pay a fine of fifteen-
> hundred tumáns.97 Reluctantly, he accepted. Then the
> governor asked for a guarantor, and Hájí Muhammad-Sádiq
> Isfahání, who ranked among the best known and most
> respected of the merchants and who was a very close friend
> of the honored Hájí, stood in this capacity. After a surety
was extracted, the Hájí was dismissed and returned home.

After the lapse of the agreed upon days, farrashes
> were sent to summon the Hájí [Abú’l-Qásim] to the
> governor’s office and to present him before Husayn Khán.
> The latter, once again, spoke most sternly demanding either
> the delivery of His Holiness or the sum of fifteen-hundred
> tumáns. The more the Hájí implored for mercy and the
> more he swore that he was bereft of any news from Him,
> the angrier the governor grew. Finally, [unable to withstand
> the governor’s admonishments,] the Hájí fell to the ground

97Fifteen-hundred tumáns represented an extraordinarily large sum of money for
that time.

seal of Manuchihr Khán presented to Husayn Khán.

Upon considering its content, [Husayn Khán] realized

before allowing the late Hájí to leave.

He further issued a command that hereafter should

would demolish that house.

Husayn Khán rounded up all the believers and

Husayn Khán was an ill-natured, wicked man, and His Holiness
the Exalted One has described his evil doings in the Khutbih-i Qahriyyih
addressed to Hájí Mírzá Aqásí, and the reader may refer to that Tablet.98
From his contemptible, base, and malicious deeds, it can readily be
discerned how truly evil and corrupt a person Husayn Khán was.

The Fate of the Báb’s Writings
In short, my late maternal grandmother would continue relating:

> After the governor’s order was noised in the city, whoever
> had received such Writings [revealed by the Báb] would
> bring them in bundles and deposit the packs in a long
> vestibule in the house of Hájí Mírzá Abú’l-Qásim. One side

98See Fayzí, Hadrat Nuqtih Ulá, pp. 151–53, and Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq,
vol. 3, pp. 85–89. In a Tablet (INBMC, vol. 64, p. 115), the Báb describes the
governor to Muhammad Sháh as “vicious and sinister” who owing to consummate
drunkenness “was never able to pass a sound judgment.”

> of the courtyard was filled with such Writings stacked high,

> in what manner were we to dispose of those Writings, and
> he had made reply, “These are all the Words of God and as

throw the water in the well of the courtyard.”

[p. 115] We placed four large washtubs on the ground
> of the courtyard, and the four of us, that is, the mother [of
> the Báb], Khadíjih Bagum, the wife of Hájí Mírzá Abú’l-
> Qásim,100 and I began to place stacks of these papers in the
> tubs and washed them much like cloths are washed by hand.
> Page by page, the ink was washed away from all the sheets,
> and the water and the papers thrown down the well.101

99 Presumably, a reference to Hájí Mírzá Siyyid-‘Alí.
100 Her name was Sultán Bagum, and she was from Jahrum.
