**Publication history**  
  
_Conquerer of Hearts_ contains excerpts from letters, talks and writings of Hand of the Cause of God Abu'l-Qásim Faizí, prepared for the benefit of the many Bahá'ís who did not have an opportunity to know him. The excerpts from his letters are mostly ones he sent to me, although I have some that other friends shared with me as well. I transcribed from the original tapes his talks to the friends in Hawaii and Australia. The section "My Memories of Mr. Faizi" includes my personal memories, a statement he made at the World Congress in 1963, and then a series of excerpts from his letters to me from 1963 to 1980. In the Introduction there is also a transcription of Mr. Faizi's talk at Foundation Hall in Wilmette in 1974. I also decided to include transcriptions of his talk on "The Hidden Words" and his commentary on the "Kitab-i-Aqdas", both of which were previously published in cassette form by the U.S. Bahá'í Publishing Trust. Also included are previous publications of Mr. Faizi's such as his "Explanation of the Greatest Name (published in the U.S. _Bahá'í News_ 1968 and reprinted by the U.S. Bahá'í Publishing Trust in 1974); "A Flame of Fire" (originally published in two parts in the _American Bahá'í News_ and subsequently by the Bahá'í Publishing Trust in India); "From Adrianople to 'Akka" (originally published by the UK Bahá'í Publishing Trust); "Divine Education" (originally published in _Glory,_ a Bahá'í youth magazine in India); and a talk titled "The Morning of Your Lives" printed in the British _Bahá'í Journal_ April 1975.  
  
Permission from the various prior publishers was given to me, as well as consent by Mr. Faizi's family to include his personal letters to me and others. The National Assemblies of Hawaii and Australia also granted me permission to use the transcription of his talks in those countries.  
  
In 1998, I submitted the manuscript to the U.S. Bahá'í Publishing Trust and then to George Ronald. I received favorable responses from each, but they were not able to publish it at the time. However, George Ronald asked my permission to place it in the Afnan Library in England for future researchers, which of course I consented to. Therefore its "first" publication is this online published compilation in the Bahá'í Library Online.
