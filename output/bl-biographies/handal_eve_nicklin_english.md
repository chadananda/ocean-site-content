> **Abstract:** Eve Nicklin was among the first American Bahá'í pioneers to South America. Armed with an unreserved love for humanity, for five decades she spread the all-embracing teachings of the Bahá’í Faith with unswerving dedication and zeal, settling in twelve cities within six South American countries. A gifted educator, Eve attracted people from all walks of life, from the university professor to the peasant and simple folk, whether a dignitary or a commoner, rich or poor, both the young and the old. Whenever someone was required to settle in the southernmost and freezing tip of the continent or in the very heart of the Andes - Eve was always the first to joyfully accept the call. Her life was characterised by a strong belief that the Bahá'í teachings were the means to achieve world unity, universal peace and the brotherhood of all faiths.

"Your steadfastness, your devotion, your historic services are
assets that I greatly value"

— Shoghi Effendi —
By the righteousness of God, should a man, all alone,
arise in the name of Bahá and put on the armor of
His love, him will the Almighty cause to be victorious,
though the forces of earth and heaven be arrayed
against him.

Bahá'u'lláh 1

It has often happened that one blessed soul has become
the cause of the guidance of a nation.

'Abdu'1-Bahá2

Just one mature soul, with spiritual understanding
and profound knowledge of the Faith, can set a whole
country ablaze — so great is the power of the Cause to
work through a pure and selfless channel.

Shoghi Effendi3

FOREWORD

Forward: The Big Yes

Heroism comes in all shapes and sizes. In Eve Nicklin's case, it
animated a middle-aged, single woman to leave a traditional
religious background for the radical, newborn Bahá'í Faith,
and then to leave the soft green hills of the eastern U.S.A. for­
ever. Settling in the grittier reality of Peru, she answered a call
to service that she couldn't deny and roused an inner great­
ness the world might never have known if she hadn't said yes.

Like a number of other middle-aged, single Bahá'í women,
she became a pioneer. Bahá'ís who go abroad to teach their
Faith aren't missionaries, but pioneers. There are no clergy in
the Baha'i Faith. Pioneers settle in a new place and earn their
living immersed in the everyday life, culture and language of
that adopted home. Eve pioneered in Brazil, Chile, Paraguay,
Uruguay and Venezuela, but Peru was the land of her heart
and Peruvian Bahä'is immortalize her as their spiritual mother.

The call that she answered first, that started her on her jour­
ney, was that of Bahá'u'lláh, the Glory of God, (1817-1892), a
Persian nobleman inspired, Baha'is believe, by the same sacred
energy that lifted Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed and
other founders of universal religions. Because He announced
Himself as the divine revelator for a new day, Bahá'u'lláh en­
dured torture, exile and imprisonment. Undaunted, He prop­
agated His message that religion is one, all races one, women
and men are equal, and earth is one country under one God.
He taught His followers that no matter what calamities befell

humanity, world peace would prevail if they made it the law of
their own lives and brought it into the lives of others.

Before His death He named His son, 'Abdu'1-Bahá (1844-
1921), the Servant of Baha'u'llah, as the example of a perfect
Bahá'í and the only interpreter of His teachings. 'Abdu'1-Bahá
left the Bahä'is in the hands of His grandson, Shoghi Effendi
(1897-1957), the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith. Now the Bahá'í
World Centre, with its gardens and golden-domed shrine,
graces Mount Carmel in Haifa, Israel, and the Universal House
of Justice, elected by the world Bahá'í community, guides the
religion's progress.

It was Eve Nicklin's good fortune to learn of the Bahá'í
Faith through three pioneering teachers who had been forev­
er transformed by meeting 'Abdu'1-Bahá. It was her privilege
to answer calls for pioneers issued by the Guardian, to corre­
spond with him, to receive his guidance and praise. He signed
his letters to her and to all the Baha'is, "Your True Brother". If
Eve, in her peregrinations, felt the need for any other family,
she didn't disclose it.

In this independent spirit she was one with sister pioneers -
Leonora Armstrong, Marcia Steward, Marian Jack, Anna Kunz,
and others. Like them, she followed the path set by one of the
first female Bahä'is, Tahirih, the Iranian poet and activist who,
to proclaim the dawning of the new era, broke her culture's
greatest taboo when she unveiled herself before a gathering
of men in 1848. Eve Nicklin and her peers also broke taboos of
tradition and prejudice in their zeal to live Bahä'u'lläh's proph-
esized Most Great Peace despite tragic, ongoing wars.

In the future, in an age of fulfillment, looking back, people
will see Eve Nicklin's brilliant star shining through the smoke
and dust of her anguished time. Because one of her Peruvian
spiritual children, Boris Handal, has so lovingly preserved her
legacy in She of the Brave Heart, they will understand how, by
saying           yes to a universal love transcending self, she pioneered
peace.

PREFACE

These pages tell the story of a life that transformed so many
individuals and communities with her natural warmth, mod­
esty and thoughtfulness. They review the accomplishments of
Miss Eve Blanche Nicklin, an early American Bahá'í pioneer to
South America.

Born in the mining town of Roanoke, Illinois, in 1895, Eve
came from a profoundly religious family and was a parish dea­
coness in New Castle, Pennsylvania. She became a Bahá'í in
1932, taught by the legendary Mabel and Howard Ives. The
immortal Hand of the Cause of God, Martha Root, also in­
spired Eve, and suggested her to go to South America which
led Eve's settling in six South American countries for nearly
five decades. A courageous woman she went to her posts with
few personal belongings but with a lot of faith.

Eve traveled extensively on teaching and administrative
appointments, taking opportunities to live among indigenous
people as well as paying special attention to the education of
younger generations. Her life was driven by a strong belief
that Bahá'u'lláh's teachings were the means to achieve world
unity, universal peace and the brotherhood of all faiths. Eve
never wavered in promoting these new principles to all whom
she came across.

Even at an advanced age, in fragile health, she remained
an inspiration to all until she died in 1985 in Peru - a country
that she always called home. The beloved Guardian and, later,
the Universal House of Justice, with much love praised her
brilliant services to the Cause of Bahá'u'lláh.

v
Tracking Eve Nicklin's life in so many countries proved to
be a formidable task in terms of interviewing and correspond­
ing with believers and institutions around the world. I am very
grateful to all who one way or another lent me a hand and
made this work possible.

This research would has not been possible without as­
sistance from the Bahá'í World Centre as well as the national
spiritual assemblies of Peru and the United States which made
available historical documents and photographs. I also would
like to thank the local spiritual assemblies of Peoria (Illinois),
Arequipa, Lima and Chiclayo (Peru) for facilitating my research
work for this book. My thanks extend likewise to the National
Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Australia for reviewing and
approving the manuscript.

The spelling of some terms in this book remains as in the
original sources. For instance, the word B a h a 'i sometimes
is spelt as B a h a i or B a h a 'i in some early publications. For the
sake of consistency, the use of the Spanish a c c e n t m a rk s (') has
been deliberately omitted in all the words (e.g. Peru and Perú).

An unfortunate cleaning mishap at the Bahá'í Center of
Lima caused the loss of most of Eve's personal and precious
written records and memorabilia, as well as other primary
sources, that had fed my early research twenty years ago. If
the present writer can claim any credit it is that Eve's literacy
and stories were providentially kept for posterity in the early
Spanish manuscript. Consequently, some of Eve's narrative and
correspondence embedded in this book had to be translated
back into English from my early translation into Spanish. When
this has happened I have indicated it in the notes section at
the end of the book.

This has been an extraordinary journey from which I
have gained invaluable life experiences. W ithout this re­
search work it would have not been possible to meet and
interview some amazing early believers who have already
left this earthly existence. Nor, I would not have been
allowed to hear all those remarkable tales of audacity and
love that were narrated to me by those early believers, often
with tears in their eyes. Separated by the curtain of death I
can still hear their enthusiastic voices while I read again their
narratives. My work also took me to visiting old historical
Baha'i places, libraries, newspaper archives or early believers
who for decades had not contacted their communities. As
any biographical research entails, there were long periods of
tedious work such as transcribing extensive interview tapes
and looking for specific information through thousands of
archive materials at the Peru National Centre, the early seat

of Baha'i administration for the ten South American coun­
tries. Eve Nicklin never kept a diary so collecting data and

> putting together the whole story seemed to be an endless
> and insurmountable task. Yet, my imagination was always
> flying away with the astounding story that, like a wonderful
> tapestry, my writing was unfolding. The support of the insti­
> tutions and the friends from all over the world was precious
> and kept me on my feet as I had to struggle with other daily
> commitments.

There were so many blessings to be thankful for, which I
experienced during my research, such as when I came across
an original Shoghi Effendi's letter kept like a treasure by an
elderly believer who for decades had not seen other Baha'i
friends, a document which had not been sent to the Baha'i
World Centre. I was also given access to many unpublished
letters of the Guardian and read avidly about his vision of

vii
the spiritual destiny of the Latin American people within the
Baha'i World.

In the final analysis, I believe, there is something of Eve
Nicklin in everyone of us, either latent or evident, whenever
we are conveying the Message of Baha'u'llah with happiness,
following unreservedly the calls from our institutions or fos­
tering love in our communities. No doubt, as someone com­
mented, in the future, schools, hospitals, universities and all
types of humanitarian institutions will be named after her.

This book is dedicated to my wife Parvin and my daughter
Camelia who at every stage and over many years encouraged
me to continue and complete this biography. Without their
support this work would had never seen the light of day.

INTRODUCTION

Many spiritual accolades can be credited to Eve Nicklin. Before
arriving in Lima, Peru in 1941 she had already responded to
Shoghi Effendi's call for pioneers in 1937 during the Seven
Year Plan and settled in Brazil. It is due to her efforts that in
1944 the first Lima Assembly was formed — an event that
Shoghi Effendi called "a great victory". She subsequently lived
in Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela but always called
Peru her "adopted country".

Although Eve became the Spiritual Mother of Peru, the
same informal designation can in some ways be applied to her
services in Paraguay where she served at three different times.
Eve came back to Peru at several stages to live in five other
cities in order to successfully form local spiritual assemblies.

In the administrative field, Eve was elected to various local
spiritual assemblies, as well as a member in 1951 of the first
National Spiritual Assembly for ten South American countries
(Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay,
Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela). In 1957 when two regional
national assemblies were created in South America, for the
southern and the northern countries, Eve remained in the
membership of the latter and years later she served as an
Auxiliary Board member under the direct guidance of the
Hands of the Cause of God. Such duties involved not only
Bahá'í administration engagement but also extensive trav­
elling throughout South America to Assembly meetings, re­
gional events and visiting and strengthening the emerging
Bahá'í communities.

Eve Nicklin: She of the Brave Heart

Eve Nicklin lived in a spirit characterized by obedience,
perseverance and wisdom. She responded almost instan­
taneously to teaching appeals, both general and specific,
from the beloved Guardian, the Hands of the Cause and the
Universal House of Justice through the successive unfoldment
of the first Seven Year Plan (1937-1944), the second Seven Year
Plan (1946-1953), the Ten Year Crusade (1953-1963), the Nine
Year (1964-1973), the Five Year Plan (1974-1979) and the Seven
Year Plan (1979-1986).

Eve traveled and served in almost every South American
country with unswerving dedication and zeal. She showed no
hesitation nor vacillation - whether a pioneer was needed at
the southernmost and freezing tip of the continent, or visiting
isolated Bahá'ís in the deep jungle, or someone was required
to settle in the very heart of the Andes — she was the first to
joyfully accept any mission.

On arriving in Peru she was a woman in her late forties, far
away from family and friends, without money or knowledge of
the language, no Bahá'í literature in Spanish and surviving on
a bare income as an English teacher in schools and hospitals.
There were no Bahä'i institutions at hand or other pioneers
to turn to in times of difficulties. She was living amid political
uncertainty, in a new culture and pressured by immigration
regulations hostile to the entry of foreigners, particularly mis­
sionaries. Eve Nicklin's sole source of guidance and encour­
agement came for many years only from her correspondence
with the beloved Guardian and the Inter America Teaching
Committee, both located thousands of miles away.

That is probably why Eve calls herself She o f th e B ra v e H e a r t
in a poem talking about her early struggles. Postal services

Introduction

were long delayed, people still traveled by sea and cablegram
communication was expensive. Despite all those daunting
conditions she persevered and achieved much.

Someone once described her as a "quiet and unglamorous
personality" and yet she had the spiritual acumen to reach all
layers of society having brought into the Faith peoples from
all walks of life, from the university professor to the illiterate
and simple folk, from dignitaries to the commoner, both the
young and the old, whether from a rich or a poor background.
As early as in the 1950s, Eve was among the first in reaching
out indigenous populations particularly with the Guarani and
Quechua ethnics groups in Paraguay and Peru, respectively.
She developed Bahá'í literature in their native languages, orgař-
nized teaching institutes and traveled and pioneered in their
areas. She also became very skilful in delivering the Message
through visual aids in the form of albums depicting a whole
variety of teachable issues.

Trained originally as a Methodist missionary, she became
good at building, developing and drawing communities to­
gether while still reaching the individual soul. Eve had particu­
larly a special rapport with the youth and children with whom
she enjoyed working. In fact, she published professional lit­
erature on child education for the broader community in both
English and Spanish. Coming from a traditional mining family,
Eve became also an excellent miner but rather than coal she
worked with the human soul which Bahá'u'lláh had referred
as a "mine rich in gems of inestimable value".4The Universal
Friendship Club which she formed in Lima embraced the
youth, both Bahá'ís and their friends, and became instrumen­
tal for the enrolment of a large number of new believers in
the early years of the Faith in Peru. Infinite love and patience

Eve Nicklin: She of the Brave Heart

towards her spiritual children and all were among her main
pioneering attributes.

What is it that makes us look at great people like Eve
Nicklin? It has been said that we all sit on the shoulder of gi­
ants. The lives of these great souls are central to understand
the early development of the Faith, and for us, theirs spiritual
heirs, help us to realize where do we situate as Bahá'ís at this
point of history. As a matter of acknowledgment, these souls
devotedly built brick by brick the foundations which we are
now standing upon. Since their arrival we have come a long
way ahead. More importantly, their labor of love permeates
our existence, enriches our lives with insightful meanings and
enlighten us with examples of faith and courage. As spiritual
giants their work took us to greater spiritual heights to see
things that we could not have experienced otherwise.

Shoghi Effendi praised her pioneering attributes at different
times and referred to her work as: "your notable and unforget­
table services"... "your meritorious and indeed historic labours"
..."your truly remarkable efforts and services";"! deeply appreci­
ate your high endeavors and the spirit that so admirably ani­
mates you in the service of our beloved Faith"; "You are certainly
seeing the harvest begin to come in, many seeds of which you
yourself sowed with such devoted care and sacrifice!"; "Your in­
valuable services, rendered with such exemplary devotion and
in such distant fields, evoke my deepfelt admiration"and"... pro­
foundly grateful for your steadfast and noble endeavors" and
was assured "that the Beloved is well pleased with the standard
of your achievements in the service of His Faith".

All world religions have heroes and saints whose memory
is.kept alive and admired. The Bahá'í Faith stands proud and

Introduction

affectionately honors their first pioneers, those who made his­
tory and constructed national communities from the ground,
as spiritual mothers and fathers. Such family-like designation
makes us by default their spiritual children. It also creates
within us the obligation to continue their legacy so that cap­
tivating legends such as Eve Nicklin continue to live forever.

THE MANDATE TO GO SOUTH

Whereas the light of Christianity took fifteen centuries to reach
the South American coasts, itself diminished by the c o n q u is ­
ta d o rs ' violence, the arrival of the Cause of Bahá'u'lláh to the
same shores was characterised by a different pattern. In fact,
it took less than three decades after Bahá'u'lláh's passing in
Palestine (1892) when His Faith had already began to illuminate
the southern hemisphere of the New World. The early years of
the annals of the Bahá'í Faith in South America were also char­
acterized by the loving and solitary apoštoláte of a number of

ladies whose spiritual dimension in this adventure of glory we
can barely weigh now.

They were Martha Root, Leonora Armstrong, May Maxwell
and Eve Nicklin: Martha the "Leading Ambassadress of His
Faith" 5, Leonora Armstrong, the "Spiritual Mother of South
America", Eve Nicklin "the Spiritual Mother of Peru", and May
Maxwell6"the Pioneer Martyr".7

Eve Nicklin: She of the Brave Heart

There were many other early pioneer women including
Marcia Steward Atwater to Chile (1940), Priscilla Rhodes (1938)
and Gwenne Sholtis (1942) to Venezuela, Gayle Woolson to
Costa Rica (1940), Rouhiyyah Jones and Katherine Didier
to Puerto Rico (1940), Elizabeth Cheney to Paraguay (1940),
Eleanor Smith Adler to Bolivia (1940), Margaret Lentz (1938)
to Dominican Republic, and Louise Caswell and Cora Oliver to
Panama (1939).

Shoghi Effendi wrote that the "boldness" of Bahá'í
women praised by 'Abdu'1-Bahá, was "in the course of time
and throughout the length and breadth of the vast and
virgin territories of Latin America, be more convincingly
demonstrated, and win for the beloved Cause victories more
stirring than any it has as yet achieved."7 Such effusion of
religious zeal the New World had never seen before.

The Tablets of the Divine Plan

The scene for such a glorious enterprise was set up in 1919
when the immortal Tablets of the Divine Plan, which were
revealed by'Abdu'1-Bahá to the Bahá'ís of the United States and
Canada, were presented at the American Bahá'í Convention
held in New York City. Many believers took the exhortations
with special fervour and immediately stood up to carry them
out and establish the Faith in distant lands. Two of those special
souls were Martha Root and Leonora Armstrong. In those
Tablets Peru is mentioned twice as one of those republics
where "[selected] important personages, or else they by
themselves, becoming severed from rest and composure of8

The Mandate to Go South

the world, may arise and travel".8 'Abdu'1-Bahá's summons to
go out and pioneer was electrifying and inspiring:

> I desire for you eternal success and prosperity and beg
> perfect confirmation for each one in the divine world.
> My hope for you is that each one may shine forth like
> unto the morning star from the horizon of the world
> and in this Garden of God become a blessed tree,
> producing everlasting fruits and results.9

Map of Latin America

Eve Nicklin: She of the Brave Heart

'Abdu'1-Bahá wrote in a Tablet to the Bahä'is of the United
States and Canada that "His Holiness Christ says: 'Travel ye
to the East and to the West of the world and summon the
people to the Kingdom of God' " (Mark 16:15). He wrote
further exhorting to go to "... Mexico... to be familiar with
the Spanish language ... [as well as to] Guatemala, Honduras,
Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and the seventh
country Belize... Attach great importance to the indigenous
population of America ... Likewise the islands o f ... Cuba, Haiti,
Puerto Rico, Jamaica,... Bahama Islands, even the small Watling
Island ... Haiti and Santo D om ingo... the islands of Bermuda ...
the republics of the continent of South America — Colombia,
Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, [the Guianas], Bolivia, Chile, Argentina,
Uruguay, Paraguay, Venezuela; also the islands to the north,
east and west of South America, such as Falkland Islands, the
Galapagos, Juan Fernandez, Tobago and Trinidad...."10

As soon as the Tablets of the Divine Plan were released
Martha Root traveled around South America visiting its main
cities. At the end of this unique mission she had successively
visited Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru and Panama.The
first seeds of the Faith were planted and the door was opened
for future North American pioneers to advance the work traced
by'Abdu'1-Bahá.

The Mandate to Go South

Martha Root, Hand of the Cause of God

In a tablet addressed to Martha Root, 'Abdu'1-Bahá praises
her efforts and admirable dedication evidenced in that journey.
In that document we find something which could be called a
vision of the establishment of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh in those
regions. The Center of the Covenant, as quoted by Shoghi
Effendi, goes to say:

> That art, in truth, a herald of the Kingdom and a harbinger
> of the Covenant. Thou art truly self-sacrificing. Thou
> showest kindness unto all nations. Thou art sowing a
> seed that shall, in due time, give rise to thousands of
> harvests. Thou art planting a tree that shall eternally put
> forth leaves and blossoms and yield fruits, and whose
> shadow shall day by day grow in magnitude.11

Going South

Seventeen years later at the 1936 American National
Convention a directive from Shoghi Effendi formally instruct­
ed the believers in the United States and Canada to look south
and systematically launch themselves into the spiritual con­
quest of Latin America:

> Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal
> voiced by 'Abdu'1-Bahá in Tablets of the Divine Plan.
> Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National
> Assembly to insure its complete fulfilment. First
> century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity
> entering outerfringes most perilous stage its existence.
> Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious.
> Would to God every State within American Republic
> and every Republic in American continent might ere
> termination of this glorious century embrace the light
> of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis
> of His World Order.12

Garreta Busey recalled the powerful effect that Shoghi
Effendi's message brought upon those attending:

> The Convention was electrified. The American Bahä'is
> were at first dazed and then galvanized into action by
> the sweeping demands of the message. To most of the
> people in the United States, the countries of South
> and Central America ... were unknown, romantic lands
> much more distant than the continent of Europe.13

The message led a series of consultations that ultimately
brought about the formation of the Inter-America Teaching

The Mandate to Go South

Committee and the launching in 1937 of the First Seven Year
Plan by the beloved Guardian. One of the "triple tasks"14 of
the Plan was to create a permanent center in each of the Latin
American republics, "for whose entry into the fellowship of
Bahá'u'lláh the Plan was primarily formulated."15

Shoghi Effendi had written in 1937:

> It should not, for one moment, be forgotten that Central
> and South America embrace no less than twenty
> independent nations, constituting approximately one
> third of the entire number of the world's sovereign
> states, and are destined to play an increasingly
> important part in the shaping of the world's future^
> destiny.16

The progress of the Cause of Bahá'u'lláh until 1944 on Latin
American soil now had had an extraordinary impulse from the
launching of this Seven Year Plan.'Abdu'1-Bahá had entrusted
the American believers with the implementation of theTablets
of the Divine Plan towards the spiritual conquest of the planet
— they had seriously assumed this historical responsibility.
Shoghi Effendi had said that in this establishment of the
Kingdom of God on earth, the North American believers were
the executors of the Divine Plan while the Canadians were
their allies and the Latin American believers their associates.
Shoghi Effendi wrote years later:

> In the far-flung Latin American field, where the first
> fruits of the Divine Plan, operating beyond the confines
> of the North American continent, have already been
> garnered in such abundance, the Latin American
> Bahá'í communities, from the Mexican border to the 1     3

> extremity of Chile, should bestir themselves for the
> collective, the historic and gigantic tasks that await
> them, and which must culminate, ere the expiration
> of the present Plan, in the formation of two national
> spiritual assemblies for Central and South America.17

Such were the victories that by 1940, within twenty-three
years after Abdu'1-Bahá's passing, only two Latin American
republics required pioneers. Shoghi Effendi indicated that
the teaching campaign in Latin America was "one of the most
glorious chapters in the international history of their Faith".18
By 1944 there were already 57 centers and 15 local spiritual
assemblies. These rising communities were lovingly raised by
the resident pioneers and travel teachers coming from North
America.They were maturing rapidly intheBahá'íadministration,
finding a place for themselves in the Bahá'í world under the
direct care of the beloved Guardian and the National Spiritual
Assembly of the United States and Canada with its executive
arm — the Inter America Teaching Committee.

So exceptional had growth become that Shoghi Effendi
felt moved to state some years later that:

> No community since the inception of the hundred-
> year-old faith of Bahá'u'lláh, not even the community of
> the Most Great Name in the North American Continent,
> can boast of an evolution as rapid, a consolidation as
> sound, a multiplication of centers as swift, as those
> that marked the birth and rise of the community of His
> followers in Latin America.19

In 1952 Shoghi Effendi referred to the same impetus:
"Compared with the length of time it took the North American,1

the British and the French communities to grow up and spread,
their [Latin American communities] growth is like lightning".20

Shoghi Effendi had described the Latin believers as "...the
eager, the warmhearted, the spiritually-minded ... this
privileged, this youngest, this dynamic and highly promising
member of the organic Bahá'í World Community."21 He asked
them to remember and reflect on the message that Bahá'u'lláh
had directed to the rulers of the American continent, contained
in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (the Most Holy Book), where the Greatest
Manifestation advises them:

> Hearken ye, O Rulers of America and the Presidents
> of the Republics therein, unto that which the Dove is

Latin Victories

Before the Centenary of the Faith in 1944, which coincided
with the end of the first Seven Year Plan, local spiritual as­
semblies in the City of Mexico and Puebla had already formed
(Mexico) as well as those in Buenos Aires (Argentina), in the
city of Guatemala (Guatemala), Santiago (Chile), Montevideo
(Uruguay), Quito (Ecuador), Bogota (Colombia), Lima (Peru),
Asuncion (Paraguay), Tegucigalpa (Honduras), San Salvador
(El Salvador), San Jose and Punta Arenas (Costa Rica), Havana
(Cuba), and Port-au-Prince (Haiti). The Centenary celebration
took place with great solemnity and had much publicity in the
auditorium of theTemple of Wilmette on May 24,1944, and was
in no doubt homage to the valiant American pioneers who ad­
ventured in those virgin territories with some laying their bones
in their soil like Eve Nicklin. Justly, Shoghi Effendi wrote to the
1944 Centenary Convention:

> The magnificent victories achieved in the teaching
> field and the sphere of administrative activity by the
> American Bahá'í community crowned with glory
> the historic services rendered by the followers of
> Bahá'u'lláh throughout the West during the last fifty

> Second Century on consolidation of the nobly-won
> victories through reinforcement of newly formed
> Assemblies, multiplication of groups and increase in
> number of Assemblies as well as corresponding effort
> through Latin America.23

What follows is the story of one of those great souls. Miss
Eve Blanche Nicklin, an American Baha'i heroine, and how she
conquered Peru — the land of the Incas.

"IN THE HANDS OF GOD"

A two-hour drive from the Bahá'í House of Worship at Wilmette,
Illinois, the village of Roanoke still stands tranquil as the place
where Eve Nicklin was born. It is located in a region known as
the Great Prairie where herds of buffalos once roamed freely
through the vast and fertile grasslands.

The first white settlers arrived in the region by the 1830s
to occupy the land once inhabited by the Sac, Fox and
Pottawantomi tribes. The relationship between Native and
European Americans was said to be friendly since the begin­
ning. Roanoke itself was formally founded in 1875 and the
region had already attracted large number of pioneers look­
ing for agricultural land or work as miners. Roanoke at that
time was inhabited by less than 1,000 people.They came from
many States in the Union as well as from the old continent
countries such as England, Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland
and Ireland who belonged to various Christian denominations
that co-existed together in peace.

At the heart of Woodford County, central Illinois, Roanoke
was the place selected by William and Mercy James Nicklin
to settle with their five children from England in the summer
of 1880. William Nicklin himself, by then 33 years old, was a
coalminer and that might have been the reason why he chose
this booming coal-mining region for the family residence.
Working in the Roanoke coal shafts was hazardous, with poor
ventilation, and even children were employed in the industry.
For instance, four miners lost their lives and many others were
wounded in a tragic accident that shook the whole village on
June 20,1906.

The Nicklin Clan

William's immediate ancestor had been a saddlebag preacher
back in England. Saddlebag ministers were pastors that
used to travel on horseback within specific geographical
jurisdictions to serve rural villages and isolated and
unorganised communities. William (1847-1933) was born in
the town of Tipton, Staffordshire and married Mercy James

(1852-1898), born in Dudley, Worcestershire. The wedding
took place on May 20,1872.

Nobody knows the exact reason why the Nicklins moved
to America but one might recall the heavy pollution belched
by factories' chimneys as well as the overcrowded living con­
ditions that made Tripton, by then an intensive coal-mining
city, be known as the                          "thequintessence of the
Dudley, a few miles away from Tipton, had similar industrial
conditions having been declared 'the most unhealthy place
in the country'. Probably due to the lack of public drinking

"In the Hands of God"

water and sewage the average age of death was 16 years and
7 months in 1852.24

Such deplorable urban environments typical from the
Victorian Era might have inspired them to cross the Atlantic
and fulfill - like many others - the legendary American dream.
Better work opportunities and higher wages made immigra­
tion peak in the second half of the nineteenth century and so
there was competition among liners that were delivering pas­
sengers in about ten days, depending on the seacraft speed
and therefore the fare. There were no immigration offices and
New York was the typical arrival port. From there, immigrants
could take trains to various states or by waterways.

From William's and Mercy's union nine children came into
the world: Mary (1873), Isaac (1875), Sophia (1878), Arthur
(1878), Eliza (1880), William (1883), Alice (1884), Lily (1893) and
finally Eve Blanche (1895). Arthur, William and Lily died very
young. The sadness at the loss of the last baby might have been
relieved when two years later on January 25,1895, a promising
child was born to them. She was Eve Blanche James Nicklin.

After two years shadows again rose over the family fortunes
when Mother Nicklin passed away. Her last words, which Eve
always felt to be a prophetic omen, were: "I leave this baby in
the hands of God." She was consequently raised by her father
and older sisters. Eve very often would acknowledge a sense of
permanent awareness of divine guidance in her life and would
say that she had always "been raised by God and always talked
to God."

Eve Nicklin as a child

The 1880 United States census reveals that the Nicklins
were temporarily living in the small village of Braceville in the
Grundy County of Illinois, taking board at the home of William
and Annie Redford. Little we know of Eve's childhood except
that other members of the Nicklin clan also emigrated from
England and likewise settled in Roanoke. It must have been
certainly a happy environment surrounded by her siblings
and many cousins, uncles and aunties. We also know that in
1906 tragedy again struck the family when her maternal auntie
Elizabeth was murdered by her husband. The local newspaper
reported that: "She was a faithful wife and loving mother and
was respected by all who knew her. She was a member of the
M. E. [Methodist Episcopal] church for a number of years and
lived a faithful Christian life."25Young Eve attended the funeral,
an event that might have made a strong impression on her
tender mind. One wonders whether that incident along with

"In the Hands of God"

her mother's early passing, affected the way she looked at life
and made her live looking for higher spiritual insights, or as a
friend of hers referred to many years ago, Eve's inner "ability to
see what was invisible to the eye physically." By then a number
of the Nicklin family members had married and settled outside
Roanoke.

We do not have much information about Eve's growing
up into maturity in Roanoke. However, it is easy to guess that
there were limited opportunities in a small township in the
Illinois countryside for young women apart from working at
home. The economy mostly rotated about the functioning of
the Roanoke Coal Mining Company that at one point of time
employed 300 men. Corn and grain crops dominated the
agricultural production in the countryside which was being
mechanised through coal-fuelled engines. Life usually revolved
around church events with ten different denominations, mostly
Protestants, living at the same time. Services accompanied by
preaching and singing were at the core of religious services
including the traditional Sunday school. There were a range of
schools in the area which had been established mostly through
community initiative to promote the education of children and
young people. The township was linked by steam trains served

by Santa Fe Railways which carried both passengers and coal
and helped to reduce economic and cultural isolation.

Two history-making events can be identified within Eve's
period of growth into womanhood. The Great War (1914-1918)
saw some Roanoke citizens die in action overseas, a conflict
that had shaken the core of American life killing 116,709
American servicemen and leaving 205,690 others wounded.
Life in a small town of 1,000 people particularly during that
bloody period and the subsequent years must have been

dreary and lackluster.'Abdu'1-Bahá Himself had predicted the
breakout of the Great War two years before in 1912.

In 1912'Abdu'l-Bahá had blessed the region when He vis­
ited Northern Illinois four times in 1912 particularly in the city
of Chicago. On May 1st of the same year'Abdu'1-Bahá laid down
the cornerstone of the Baha'i House of Worship on the shores
of Lake Michigan just 117 miles (190 kilometers) from where
Eve was living. Referring to the spiritual promise of the region,
'Abdu'1-Bahá stated in one of the Tablets of the Divine Plan re­
vealed on February 8,1917:

> Continually my ear and eye are turned toward the
> Central States; perchance a melody from some blessed
> souls may reach my ears -- souls who are the dawning-
> places of the love of God, the stars of the. horizon of
> sanctification and holiness-souls who will illumine this
> dark universe and quicken to life this dead wofld. The
joy of'Abdu'l-Baha depends upon this! I hope that you

may become confirmed therein.. ,26

The decline in Roanoke's coal mining industry in the mid­
twenties impacted seriously on the local economy and many
people emigrated. In 1925 Eve and her almost octogenarian
father moved to the city of Delavan, Wisconsin, to live in the
home of her sister Eliza, fifteen years her senior.

For a while Eve went to work as a clerk for the company
Holstein Guernsey. She quickly made friends with her col­
leagues and with the family formed a walking club for enjoy­
ment. They would go early in the morning to the countryside,
afterward making a fire and preparing breakfast.2

"In the Hands of God

Dolores Swatsley, Eliza's daughter born in 1918, created a
strong bond with Eve that kept them in touch throughout all
her long pioneering years in South America.25

Roanoke Labor Day Celebration in 1911

FROM DEACONESS TO PIONEER

It was probably the religious background at home that led Eve
to enrol at the National School for Deaconesses and Methodist
Missionaries in Kansas City in the fall of 1925, when she was
thirty years old. The purpose of the institution was to provide
training in missionary service to country areas and also abroad.
The minimum requirement of registration was to have complet­
ed high school. Among the courses that formed the curriculum
were: Hebrew history, social sciences, recreation, industrial arts,
home economics, history of the church, the Bible, missions,
New Testament themes, history of education and civilization,
child psychology and storytelling.

Eve stood out with her special artistic talents. May F. Brown,
her best classmate, has said: "Eve used to paint, draw, and write
prose, fiction and poetry. She had the soul of an artist. Her body
was fragile and her appearance was misleading for both her
body as spirit were strong. Eve was quick to see what was invis­
ible to the eye physically. She also had a keen sense of humour.2  7

I was in her class in the year before, and soon we became friends.
She was a conscientious student". In another facet of her literary
life, she wrote a half-hour play entitled "The Christ of Youth". Its
purpose was to highlight a life consecrated to serve others. To
May she wrote the poem "Speaking psychologically":

> It has been said
> If we hate
> All of hatred from
> Past eons
> Becomes our legacy;
> And love
> It attracts Love
> Then
> All the great friendships
> Through the ages
> Belong to me.
> Because
> I have a sympathetic friend
And she will be mine

For all eternity27

Eve stayed in the school until the autumn of 1928 when
she finally completed her studies having her consecration on
October 12,1928. In a letter written to a close friend forty-four
years later, Eve tells us about the providential way through
which she decided to serve as a deaconess in the city of New
Castle. It is there where Eve was going to take one of the most
wonderful steps of her life. According to Eve:2

> woman from the Personnel Department cameto Kansas
> City ... She asked me if I had any place in particular
> where I wanted to be sent to work. I said no, and she
> said she wanted to locate the best graduates, and
> sent me to New Castle, Pennsylvania, just where later I
> found Bahá'u'lláh through Martha Root and the Ives!28

Eve Nicklin as a young woman in the United States

Eve the Deaconess

1930 saw the Great Depression in full swing following the
famous BlackTuesday stockmarket crash. In the same year Eve
Nicklin began working as a deaconess at the Methodist Church
in Croton Avenue, New Castle, Pennsylvania. That was one of
the four Methodist churches in that city. The names of two of
the three other churches were the First Methodist Church and
Epworth Methodist Church.29

Deaconesses were meant to assist in the work of the
church serving children, the youth and the elderly. Eve lived
in a diaconate with three other deaconesses from the other
churches. Every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon Eve con­
ducted children's classes. She also taught crafts, sewing and
English to immigrants and of course, religion. Prayer meetings
were on Wednesdays from seven to eight in the evening while
on Sunday morning the church service and Sunday school
took place. There was another service on Sunday night as well
as the regular youth gathering.

Because of her job Eve had to wear the deaconess dress
which she hated. It consisted of a wide ruched white collar
and a black bonnet with white ribbons. Dr. Eugenia Pritchard,
to whom we owe a valuable work on Eve's pre-Bahá'í days indi­
cated that Eve did not like the bonnet and had to arm herself
with great courage to wear the black hat. Also, Eve did not like
her role belonging to the mourner's women's bench. When
the faithful came to the altar of the church, these women had
to come and pray for other peoples'sins, Eve had to kneel with
them and pray. It was very difficult for her to do that role.29

From Deaconess to Pioneer

It is in those days when Eve began her great friendship
with Amelia Buxton, who had started working as a volunteer
in the same church. At some stage Eve lived far away, on the
south side of town and had to take two trams to get to the
diaconate. On Sundays she was invited to Amelia's home, just
one and a half blocks away from the church, as Eve had to
be there both in the morning and the afternoon. Even when
Eve was invited to other places still she used to go to Amelia's
home for a siesta.

Amelia tells us about the curiosity permeating those days:

> We were four (Eve, Leona, Nolan and Sara...) and I who
> met frequently. I do not know why, but you could n o t,
> imagine such a well-integrated group. Sara was a very
> quiet person and never had strong personal opinions,
> and Leona was similar but had no views but was rather
> chatty and not into much thinking (a really sweet
> person and I still miss her): she never could appreciate
> the Bahá'í Faith, nor did she try. One evening they were
> with me for lunch because of Leona's birthday. We all
> lived near except Eve ... When we were having lunch
> Eve always guided the conversation sooner or later to
the subject of religion. We were talking and during the

> course of the conversation Eve said:'Now, Leona, what
> is your idea of heaven, what do you think heaven look
> like?' Well, Leone, became very serious, thought for a
> minute and said, 'Well, I do not know. I guess it is just
> a place where we will all sit down together and talk'.
> She had no more than what came out of her mouth,
> and the beloved Eve lifted her arms upward and said,
'Oh, I do not expect that, it would be hell for me'. Well,3

> it shocked us all three because she was so serious ...

Often we talked about i t ...30

Becoming a Bahá'í

It was then that they both began searching for other religious
and esoteric movements such as the Rosicrucians, astrology,
etc. It was also when Ruth Wright, Eve's friend from a New
Age Group Club (presumably a Bahá'í group) and herself not
a Bahá'í, invited her to a talk at the city public library. The
talk was given by Howard Colby Ives and his wife Mabel —
renowned Bahá'í teachers confirmed by Abdu'1-Bahá. Eve
informed Amelia of the talk and both went in Amelia's car.
The presentation was about the Progressive Revelation. It
was God who was opening this big door in their lives.

In an interview conducted by Mario Leon in 1975, Eve told
him that "[0]ne day some friends invited me to a talk about
the Bahá'í Faith. The talk was given by a lady named Martha
Root." Mario asked her: "Did you enter the Bahá'í Faith through
Martha Root?" Eve replied: "Yes, she was my spiritual mother.
Later I met Mabel and Howard Colby Ives. They were my dear
teachers who were ordered to deepen my knowledge of the
Faith."31

In a letter to Amelia, forty years later, Eve w rote:"... It was
also her (Martha Root) whom I asked how to become a Bahá'í.
A year later, in another letter she said:"... It was then that I met
Bahá'u'lláh through Martha Root and the Ives."32 This might
have happened the year that Martha Root spent touring vari­
ous American cities including Chicago and Madison (where
Eve's family resided) and traveled throughout the state of

From Deaconess to Pioneer

Pennsylvania. It is not possible to ascertain exactly whether
Martha Root was in New Castle.

Leonora Armstrong, Spiritual Mother of
South America, arriving to Bahia in 1921

That city was Martha Root's home town and she might
have returned in 1931 and met Eve and Amelia. However,
many years later, Amelia did not remember Martha Root.
Putting aside historical issues, Amelia tells us:

> She [Eve] was very weak. She was very thin and became
> tired quickly. So when we heard about that talk, I
> said,'Well, Eve, I'll drive'. Howard Colby Ives had three
> names ... He was there, but he had had an operation

> 'I remember the time when you took me to Ives'farm
> and I think that perhaps I would not be teaching the
> Faith here in Peru and South America had it not been

Dr. Pritchard wrote about the same days:

> Afterwards, every Sunday the Ives -held meetings at
> their farm-house which they rented in August, although
> Howard Colby Ives was recovering ... Eve and Amelia
> enjoyed these meetings and were attracted to them
> like a magnet. It was there in that beautiful farmhouse
> located on a hill facing the mountains that the Holy Spirit

and scented by the fragrance of flowers that Eve turned

her being towards God, drank from the cup of love of
God and devoted her services to Bahá'u'lláh. The drop

> had returned to the ocean and the small sprout had
> blossomed into a beautiful flower.34

Even until in 1971, Eve reminded her colleague Beulah
McGruderofthe past days: "...and I remember you Beulahrand
I clearing my head with these new Teachings and not knowing
how to deliver these Teachings and half-scared of letting you
know that I was already Bahá'í and so on and trying to keep
my mouth closed."35

Eventually Eve embraced the Cause of Bahá'u'lláh and left
the Methodist Church. In a letter to Amelia in 1965 she writes

about the effect that the separation had on their coreligion­
ists: "We were shocked anytime someone left the herd." Her
enrolment took place on February 2, 1932 in New Castle —
according to a card she filled in 1936 for the BaháT archives.
Her recorded address is 129 South Street, Delavan, Wisconsin.
Such must have been a difficult moment in Eve's life coping
with her father's death in 1933 as well as making her full tran­
sition into the Bahá'í Faith.

Mabel and Howard Colby Ives

"I think," Amelia Buxton wrote, "she left the church soon
after. She wrote articles to make some money because she had
only what she earned. She could have stayed in the church
simply because she could not find anything else searching for
a job. About belonging to the Church in her heart, I do not
think she belonged to that church after the first night she
heard the talk about progressive revelation by Mabel Ives.
That gave me so much food for thought."363 5

The most "difficult" part of the journey, that is, the full rec­
ognition of Bahá'u'lláh as a new Manifestation of God, was
achieved. In a way she had put the cart before the horses,

because while studying the Baha'i Faith she was consider­
ing herself a Bahá'í at times. Jesus Christ had been lovingly

> enthroned for over thirty years in her life and conciliating
> her traditional belief system with Bahá'u'lláh's teaching must
> have been difficult. Yet, her new Faith encotiraged her to
> love Jesus Christ as much as she did before. Eve had found
> that Bahá'u'lláh was actually the return of Jesus Christ and in
> broader terms the Promised One of all religions. Like Peter,
> Andrew, James and John (Mathew 4:18-22) she did not need
> elaborated theological evidences because truth is simple and
> the proof itself was already in her heart. While at the begin­
> ning her feet might have been in two camps, gradually she
> sailed away on her own mystical journey to see God's creation
> with new vistas. She experienced new things, discovered new
> meanings and understood new realities to the stage when
> suddenly the point of no return had been crossed. The fear of
> losing her social or religious identity turned into courage, hap­
> piness and awe. She was a Bahá'í for good.

In 1933 and 1934 Eve worked as director of the Methodist
orphanage "Ruth M. Smith" in Cheffield, Pennsylvania which
had been established in 1922. In 1935 she requested leave
of absence for the purpose of going to a "school" in Chicago
and in the following year the Church gave Eve "an honorary
discharge". Bahďí News reported in the same year that 1935
"an attempt was made to found a Sunday School in the House
of Worship for children whose parents were attending the
regular afternoon meeting ... This Sunday School was under
the direction of Mrs. Howard Ives, assisted by Miss Eve Nicklin,
Mrs. Inez B. Ford and Mrs. Philip Marangella."37This all shows3  6

that Eve had made the transition well having her heart filled
with joy and peace.

Beulah McGruder eventually accepted the Faith through
Eve. She was the deaconess of the First Methodist Church and
president of her class at the School of Missionaries in Kansas
City. Both had lived together in the diaconate. Years later she
became a Bahá'í pioneer to Colon, Panama. We also know that
she spoke to her colleagues with courage about the Faith and
that two of her teachers in the School of Kansas accepted this
Glorious Cause.

In October 1935 Eve wrote to Shoghi Effendi of her rela­
tionship with the Methodist Church receiving the following ^
communication from his secretary dated November 17,1935.

Dear Bahá'í Friend,

The Guardian has deeply enjoyed reading your
> letter of October sixth and feels greatly appreciative
> of your immediate whole-hearted response to his
> instructions regarding non-membership by the
> believers in religious organizations and groups other
> than those instituted by the Cause. He particularly
> values the self-sacrifices you have undergone for the
> sake of upholding this vital principle the importance
> of which will be increasingly unveiled to all the friends.
> He feels certain that Bahá'u'lláh will fully repay you for
> all the material losses you have incurred as a result
> of your dissociation from the Methodist Episcopal
> Church. For you have, indeed, set a beautiful example
of courage, loyalty and devotion which every sincere

upholder of the Cause cannot fail to admire. It is hoped3 7

that through it those among the believers who are
as yet not sufficiently convinced of the necessity of
dissociating themselves from their churches will be
so deeply distressed as to sever official connection
with them, and thus become whole-hearted and
unqualified in their allegiance and loyalty to the Cause
of Bahá'u'lláh.

Assuring you again of Shoghi Effendi's abiding
appreciation of your services, and with his prayers and
best wishes for you, and all the friends in your center,

Yours in His Service,

H. Rabbani

With the renewed assurance of my loving prayers
for your spiritual advancement and for the success of
your self-sacrificing efforts in the service of our glorious
Cause,

Your true brother,

Shoghi38

EveNicklin in 1935

It was Martha Root who asked her if she wanted to be a
pioneer in the First Seven Year Plan which was launched in
1937 by the beloved Guardian. It was also she who helped
Eve to commence her first teaching experience in the inter­
national field that same year in Brazil.This was happening at a
time when Eve was a five-year-old Bahá'í. But this is the topic
for the next chapter.

TO THE CONQUEST OF PERU

During 'Abdu'1-Bahá's life Martha Root visited Lima at some
point in her South American tour. Although short the one-day
stopover in October 1919 was nevertheless the first step pav­
ing the way for the coming of future teachers and pioneers.

Martha Root in Lima

Martha Root's description of her short time in Lima is found in
the October 1920 edition of the Star o f the West.

> Lima, in Peru, the seat of the old Inca civilization, was
> the most important city visited after leaving Valparaiso.
> Its population is 250,000. Dr. Vargas [a friend from
> her Argentina visit] had given to Miss Root letters of
> introduction to nineteen cities and towns and four
> were to his friends in Lima, which is his native city —
> one was to a newspaper owner, one to a senator, and

> two to physicians. As Lima is a half-hour from the port
> Callao, and the ship only stopped three hours in the
> early morning, it was a problem how to get there, find
> these men, and get back on time. On the electric tram
> Miss Martha Root met two young men from the ship
> who spoke English and Spanish. They took her to the
> leading hotel to inquire from the manager how to reach
> these people. He was an old man and wonderfully kind.
> He told Miss Root to sit down and write her message to
> each man and he would take them with her letters of
> introduction, Bahai booklets and magazine clippings
> to each man. He assured her the newspaper owner
> would use an article and volunteered to translate it
> into Spanish. It was all done so easily and quickly, and
> the two young men from the ship, getting interested,
mailed to their sisters in Australia and New Zealand,

> Bahai booklets from that hotel. After Callao no more
> letters of introduction could be used as the ship was
> not allowed to stop at any more ports owing to fever
> conditions.39

Those activities had earned 'Abdu'1-Bahá's love Who later
wrote to her:

> Praise be to God the Call of the Kingdom has been
> received in South America and the seeds of Guidance
> have been sown in those cities and regions. Certainly
> the heat of the Sun of Reality, the rain of the Eternal
> Bounty and breeze of the Love of God will make them
> germinate: have confidence.40

It is noteworthy that in the same year when Martha Root
visited Lima, Kenzo Torrikai (1882-1965), a Japanese citizen4

To the Conquest of Peru

who became a Bahá'í in the United States, was also living in
Peru for some months. Later Kenzo Torrikai went to live in
Japan.41

Leonora Armstrong and Bahia

Leonora Armstrong was another soul who perfectly under­
stood the need expressed by'Abdu'1-Bahá for the promotion
of the Cause in the southern lands. She had written to Martha
Root for guidance. A prompt reply told her to travel to
Argentina inspiring Leonora to begin to take Spanish classes.
In the meantime, Martha had received a letter from friends
made on her trip to Brazil requesting a Bahá'í teacher. As a ,
result, Martha recommended Leonora to go to Brazil.

Leonora's relatives and friends were her first tests as she
began making plans. They warned of the dangers in carrying
out her intentions. She was doubting and thinking of going to
Canada when May Maxwell, the mother of Rúhíyyih Khánum,
lying sick in bed, told her in vibrant tone: "Leonora, what are
you waiting for? Go!"42

Leonora obeyed and established herself forever in Brazil.

She arrived in February 1921 and died there on October 17,
1980, thus gaining enduring glory for her pioneering services,
and serving in her last years as a member of the Continental
Board of Counsellors for the Protection and Propagation of the
Faith in South America. Leonora Armstrong settled in Bahia
following 'Abdu'1-Bahá's advice in the Tablets of the Divine
Plan: "Likewise the city of Bahia, situated on the eastern shore
of Brazil. Because it is some time that it has become known by
this name, its efficacy will be most potent."43

So the tree planted by Martha Root continued to grow and
bear those abundant fruits predicted by'Abdu'1-Bahá. As seen
early, Eve Nicklin was one of those spiritual fruits who had also
received advice from Martha to go to South America, and so
she did.

Eve's "Debut" in Brazil

In an interview conducted by Mario Leon (ML), Eve Nicklin
(EN) talked of how she was conducted by Martha to render
her now historical services throughout South America decade
after decade.

ML: Eve, Could you tell us something of Martha Root?

EN: She was a wonderful Bahá'i teacher. A great pioneer.

> Not without reason, the beloved Guardian called
> her the “star-pioneer". She traveled the world teach­
> ing the Faith to kings, princes, personalities through­
> out the world. You have to study the life of Martha
> in-depth.

ML: How did you decide to become a pioneer?

EN: One day she told me that the beloved Guardian had

> launched a plan. The plan was called the "Seven Year
> World Crusade". He was asking the American Bahá'ís to
> leave to South America as pioneers. She asked me if I
> could go.

ML: So... what did you answer?4

To the Conquest of Peru

EN: I told her that I would think about it. She told me that

> I should to write to the Inter America Committee if I
> decided. So I did .44

The committee's response took Eve to Brazil to support
Leonora's work. Martha Root helped her with a hundred dol­
lars and a ticket on a steam ship. Eve eventually returned the
money. On February 28, 1937, Martha Root gave her a scroll
with the Greatest Name, which is still preserved in the Bahá'í
National Archives in Lima, Peru. According to Amelia Buxton:

> I had visited Eve in New Castle on February 28, 1937.
> She gave me a bookfrom which she wanted me to copy
> a few things to it. I single-spaced typed this material „
> and also made carbon copies for her which I delivered
> after a week. Then on May 2 3 1went to see her because
> I knew soon she would travel to Brazil. I returned the
> next night to visit her again. She said she was going to
> be in the park the next morning and asked me to come
> and see her there. I did it because I had a bathing suit
> and a light jacket for her as gifts which I gave her. She
> left the port of New York on June 5 for Brazil. I knew she
> was going to return in six months so that I came back
> in December and I learned that I had a card from her.
> She wrote on Christmas on the boat coming to New
York and sent it to me from New York. Meanwhile, I

had received a card from her sister saying that she was
going to go home on the first day of the year or so,

because her visa had been cancelled.45

The dictatorship in Brazil did not recognize her passport
and therefore she had to leave the country. However, Eve to
her satisfaction had already assisted Leonora in her work,

especially in the school for orphans and poor children in Bahia
that she had initiated and hoped that Eve would lead.

Such a humanitarian work was praised by Shoghi Effendi
as a way to reach the local population. There were about sev­
enteen children between four and eleven years of age.They all
lived in a big rented house with a big garden where children
could play with occasional outings to the beach. The daughter
of a Bahá'í couple was the caretaker and also acted as the foster
mother. Eventually, Eve took over her position and lived in the
school with the children. Bahá'í prayers and principles were
also taught to the kids. In addition, Leonora hired a teacher
for them as well as a seamstress. This lady used to mend the
children's clothes and teach them some sewing practical skills.
In her book in Portuguese about Leonora Armstrong, Gabriel
Marques describes how Leonora had to stretch her meagre
financial resources to support the school as food and other
necessities were provided. Dental and medical care was out­
sourced from local professional who offered their services for
free at Leonora's request.

Unfortunately Eve's poor knowledge of Portuguese did
not help her much which made her feel a bit frustrated.
Later she moved to a pension of an English lady who found
some students for her to teach English. This apparently
made her happier as Eve was able to simultaneously con­
nect directly to the wider population and teach them the
Baha'i Faith. Her poem "Christmas in Brazil" w ritten dur­
ing her "first tropical Christmas" reflects some homesick
feelings:

> What? there are not socks
Hanging in a row;4

To the Conquest of Peru

%

> There is no Santa Claus,
> Neither winter snow nor sleighs?
> There are no Christmas trees
> Real and alive,
> To circle them around and
> Sing, and to freeze the toes,
> No Christmas!
> Oh! But there are shoes
> Waiting in line
> For Santa Claus,
> To hide there
> Their gifts,
> And royal palms,
> And seas and skies
> Blue and warm
> And friends'hearts
> Wishing you, "Merry Christmas".

According to Eve, she had had her "debut" and already
"carried pioneering blood". She was impatient and eager to
continue in that wonderful field of service especially in South
America. The National Assembly of United States and Canada
reported in the          íNews that "Miss Nicklin proved that a

> ď
> h
> a
> B
believer with professional training can establish himself finan­
cially in another country..."46 Upon her return she pioneered to
West Virginia at Wayside Farm in Parkersburg. We find her serv­
ing on the Regional Teaching Committee for Ohio, Indiana and
Western Pennsylvania. Above all the Brazilian difficulties, the
spirit of Eve had yielded one of its first fruits. According to Doris
McKay:

> Eve Nicklin returned in September. She had been
with us for a few days in the spring and, while she4

> was away from the orphan asylum, her supervisor had
> opened some of her Baha'i mail. Eve was in trouble
> because her job was with the Methodist Church and
> the woman who had opened the mail was not very
> warm about it. She had called in Eve's two assistants,
> Wreatha [Cranston] (a Baha'i) and Betty (about to
> become a Baha'i). Eve eventually lost her job with the
> Church, the job for which she had been trained. Now
> she was living in Rochester working as a housekeeper.
> She told us how she had been saving money from her
> paltry wages; how she had been preparing to offer
> herself as a pioneer to Peru. As she described her
> intentions, Willard and I exchanged a glance which
> needed no words. We gave Eve one of the two hairs
> of Baha'u'llah that Martha Root had given Willard
after his southern tour with Louis Gregory. Eve was

> leaving Jamestown to consult with members of the
> National Assembly about pioneering. But this Eve, of
the daring black beret and bright red earrings had left

her lipstick at home. She fretted, "I'm sure they won't
take me w ithout my lipstick." I made a concoction from

> cinnamon candy which worked as a poor substitute.
> Eve was accepted and became the second pioneer
> to leave from Jamestown for South America (John
> Stearns47, ... was the first.) I saw Eve several years ago
> in the movie, Green Light Expedition. Hand of the
> Cause, Ruhiyyih Khanum, had called her the "Mother
> of Peru".48

We also know from Eve that she wrote to the National
Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States and
Canada informing them about her pioneering experience.

Eve was told to think of another country. Years passed until
she received a communication asking if she would like
to go to Peru. She responded positively and immediately
went to the library to find out everything about Peru.
Its history particularly fascinated her. The month before
her departure the beloved Guardian sent the following
cablegram:

> Assure [Eve] Nicklin prayers [for] success [in]
> Peru. Convey [Elizabeth] Cheney loving concern,
> fervent prayers [for her] recovery [and my] deepest
> adm iration.49

That was how she embarked to Peru, a country totally^
strange to her, without knowledge of its language, people
or culture. That was however the country which she would
later call "my adopted country." Edna True from the National
Spiritual Assembly of the United States and Canada arranged
her ticket and told her"Well, you've had your'curtain lifted on'.
That was Bahia." Nevertheless, travelling overseas again must
have been another painful separation from her family as Eve
loved them as much as they loved her.

After Martha Root's visit, Lima received some Bahál travel
teachers from North America such as Mrs Loulie Mathews,
who was accompanied by her husband and travelled to Latin
America in 1935 at Shoghi Effendi's suggestion. Other visitors
included Elizabeth [Isabel] Stebbins Dodge (1935-38) and her
mother Joel (May) Stebbins (1937), as well as Stuart W. French
and his wife Nellie S. French (1936).50 Martha Root had passed
away in September 1939 in Hawaii.

Lima in the 1940s

Dodges'Teaching in Lima

As indicated earlier, Isabel Dodge had been living in Peru for a
period of time at the Morococha mines, in the central Andes.
She and her husband, a mining engineer, had left Peru three
years before Eve came. Isabel's recollections of her teaching
work were as follows:

> The first Bahá'í meeting in Peru was conducted in July
> 1937 at the home of Mrs. Garcia Rosell in Lima. Francis
> Benedict, an American Bahá'í, had met Mrs. Garcia
> Rosell. I was told during a trip to the United States in
> 1936 that she had favourably responded to Bahá'u'lláh's
> message. Her address was also given to me.51

I went to Peru in July 1935 with my husband, a
> mining geologist, who worked at the Cerro de Pasco
> Copper Corporation. We lived at a mining camp in5 0

Morococha, Peru, 14,000 feet high in the Ancles and
about 100 miles from Lima, the capital of Peru. During
my first year in Peru, I wrote to Miss Leonora Holesapple
(Armstrong) that lived in Bahia, Brazil. She had made
a Spanish translation of "Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era"
by Dr. Eslemmont and sent me a number of paperback
issues for use in the teaching work. They arrived by
land mail after a journey of several months through the
Pichis route [Amazon basin] by mule. Many volumes
were stained with water spots.

In February 1937, Ms. Nellie French stopped in Lima
for a day on a trip around South America. Ms. French
and I visited the National Library and presented a copy
of "Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era". We also visited some
of the offices of newspapers in Lima but could not get
any publicity for the Faith.

When my mother, May Stebbins (Mrs. Joel), came to
Peru for a visit during the summer of 1937, we visited
Mrs. Garcia Rosell to ask if she could arrange some sort
of meeting for us to introduce the Bahá'í Faith. She
said she would be very happy to do so because she
knew a number of liberal thinkers in Lima ... Also, her
son, a dentist, knew English and could help translate
for us. Accordingly, the meeting was conducted in
the Rosell's apartment with nearly twenty people in
attendance. My mother gave a talk on the Faith which
was translated into Spanish by Dr. Garcia Rosell. Then I
spoke in Spanish on the construction of the Temple in
Wilmette and its symbolism of the unity of all religions.
The audience was receptive and we distributed copies
of "Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era" to those who wanted.
At that time we did not have brochures in Spanish.5  1

About a month later a smaller meeting was held
at the [Garda] Rosell's home with mostly new people.
In early October 1938, my husband Theodore Dodge,
a non-Bahá'í at that time, gave a talk on the Bahá'í
principles at the Garcia Rosell's home to a number of
seekers, many of them Theosophists. The Message
was also given to other individuals when we had the
opportunity to do so during our three-year stay in Peru.

It was difficult to do some follow up work after
these meetings because my husband and I did not live
in Lima and could only "come down" from the mining
camp on holidays. My mother and I spent two months
in Lima in a pension house during the summer of 1937.
My husband gave his talk in October 1938 just before
boarding his boat back to the United States at the end
of his contract.52

Isabel's teaching activities reports appeared on the
December 1937 and July 1938 editions of Baha'i News and
were instrumental in educating American believers as to how
Latin people reacted to the Bahá'í principles. Those isolated
pieces of information coming from overseas certainly were
read by Eve and made her cognisant of the local receptivity.
Dodge's addressees in the meetings consisted of "men and
women, engineers, business men, naval, and military officers,
and their wives, and also a number of young men and girls."

Mrs. Garcia Rosell published the Universal magazine in
Lima and managed to invite a selected group of "liberal think­
ing" people. For Mrs. Garcia Rosell "these doctrines were the
highest, the most elevated in the world". According to Isabel
Dodge, Mrs. Garcia Rosell "would put notices in the papers
and send out invitations so that as many people as possible
could hear mother [May Stebbins] speak".

Peruvians also "thought it [the Baha'i Faith] a magnificent
plan for the world" whose principles "were very good, very
important". Dodge reported that the Peruvians were very inter­
ested in the principle of independent investigation of truth
because as an attendant paraphrased her "we must 'know
with our own understanding and not by the understanding of
any in the world'" The Dodges "had been somewhat anxious
about offending anyone" due to religious sensitivities, "but no
one criticized or attempted to argue with us on any point" but
were warned that "there were many fanatical and conserva­
tive people here."

The talks focused on topics such as "The Temple", "The
Oneness of Mankind", "Security for a Failing World" and
"Science and Religion". "There seemed to be a considerable

amount of interest aroused as people began to discuss our
answers, more questions ..."and"we passed around pictures
of'Abdu'1-Bahá and the Temple" whose construction attracted
special attention and many questions. They were also curious
about the Bahá'í stance on the immortality of the soul and
reincarnation as well as the definition of religion. A profes­
sor of economics became interested on the Bahá'í principles
in that field. The group was spiritually hungry, loved the new
teachings and asked for more.

A study group was proposed to study all the chapters of
'Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era' a plan that Mrs. Garcia Rosell
promised to carry on after the Dodges left. Dodges'activities
were significant because, although small in scope, the Bahá'í
teachings were for the first time formally introduced to local
people at a discussion based environment. Moreover, such
activities were run by friends of the Faith accompanied of liter­
ature and advertised through public notices. As Isabel Dodge

> put it:"We were delighted that our audience had been entirely
> Peruvians and if it were not for the Rosells we would have met
> only Americans and English in Lima."53' 54

Upon her arrival, about three years later, Eve tried repeat­
edly to make contact with Mrs. Garcia Rosell but only man­
aged to meet with her on one occasion. The meeting was
not very productive because Mrs. Garcia Rosell did not speak
English and Eve did not understand Spanish. However, the
Dodges'experience had assured Eve that souls were receptive
and waiting, eager to listen about the Message of Bahá'u'lláh.

A MAJOR VICTORY

The sea trip to Peru took fifteen days. At the port of Callao, the
gate of Lima — the"City of Viceroys", the'Three Times Crowned
Royal Villa", the "Pearl of the Pacific" and the most important
center of Spanish Christianization in the Americas — making
history, Eve Nicklin arrived on Friday October 3,1941, with the
mandate to conquer spiritually a whole country.

Settling in Lima

Eve came with fifty dollars, her clothes, few Bahá'í books in
English and no understanding of Spanish at all. With that
money she could pay forty-five days of boarding. The board­
ing was previously arranged by Gertrude Hanks, the director
of the Lima Methodist College, an old acquaintance of North
America as well as a personal friend. She sent someone to
receive Eve at the port and also helped her to get established,
the first concern of every pioneer. After a few weeks Gertrude

had secured a job for Eve. No matter what Eve's new religious
affiliation was, the friendship was genuine and continued.
Someone said that Methodists are among the best of the ecu­
menical community but certainly God was already working.

Eve Nicklin (date unknown)

Having begun her settlement. Eve continued her simple
plan of adjusting to a new life and culture, making contacts
and learning the new language. However, she had not arrived
at the best time in Lima's civil and religious life. It was actually
a time of transition and crisis in Lima's society. We could say
that history was creating the right conditions for Eve's arrival:
the day before an armistice was signed to end the military
conflict which had been stirring on the northern border. The
storm of the Second World War was also shaking the peoples
of the world spreading belligerent unrest everywhere.

As war ironically prompts feelings for peace, national­
ism induces those for universalism. Lima was experiencing a

A Major Victory

thirst for knowledge about other countries. News of the war
circulated like an informal geography lesson. Many enrolled
in English classes, particularly young people, wishing one
day to taste fortune in the great Republic of the North — the
United States of America. That was the period of the begin­
ning of commercial aviation, the atom and the radio airing
new ideas such as world peace, religious tolerance, unity
of nations, freedom and democracy. Those were years of
change.

A new Constitution had clearly instituted freedom of wor­
ship eight years ago after a long struggle initiated by refor­
mative elements. Despite such a milestone, some conserva­
tive groups were still advocating against anything that could
mean the development of alternative religious movements
and the entry of foreign missionaries.55 Eve seemed to have
perceived the prevailing atmosphere and developed an indi­
rect method of teaching to reach people.

We have Eve's first report to the Inter-America Teaching
Committee dated two days after her arrival and from her new
accommodation at 513 Maximo Abril Street in Lima.

Dear Miss True, Mrs. French:

This is Sunday morning and I thought that it would
> be a good idea to get caught up on letters. We arrived
> in Lima on the third. I guess we made up some time by
> not staying so long at different ports. We were in a part
> of a hurricane that swept through the Caribbean seas.
> We were tossed about a bit — even out of our chairs
> onto the floor. I didn't realize we were in a hurricane
> because they didn't tell us. We just thought it was a

bad storm. Some were frightened, however, and sea­
sick. I was neither. (Maybe I was too "dumb" to know the
danger). Some of us gathered into one cabin during
the storm, and braced ourselves against whatever we
could. Religion naturally was brought up, so it gave me
an opportunity to talk about the Faith. One woman
was so frightened during the storm that she swore off
drinking, and she actually did, too. That is while we
were aboard the ship.

We didn't have much of a stop at Panama, but a
letter was waiting from Mrs. Oliver, and I got in touch
with her at Washington Hotel, and we did have a visit
short and sweet.

Miss [Gertrude] Hanks was out of town so she sent
another teacher to meet me and take me through
customs. They are so strict here as this teacher said.
They were too, with some, but you know they hardly
looked at mine, and didn't care at all about the books.
They looked at one group of University Book Shelf that
I brought with me. They were interested in silk dresses
and furs, and the like. One lady that was with me had a
terrible time about her things.They even held one suit
case.

This lady that had such a time at custom is a Mrs.

Gray. She was so sweet - travelled all over the world,
and had seen and met Abdul-Baha and his wife. Can
you imagine that? She is a Catholic woman, and very
broad in her thinking but still she is a Catholic. She is
a great friend, too, of the Bahais. She has nothing but
the greatest admiration for Abdul-Baha. And I guess,

A Major Victory

has defended the Faith many times when people have
criticised it. Well, she and I came to the same Pension
— one that Miss Hanks had recommended — and
were together that first night and next day which
was yesterday. She is a great friend of the American
consul's wife, Mrs. Boyce, she called her up, and Mrs.
Boyce came after us with her car. Took Mrs. Gray back
to customs to get her bag [sic], (at this moment a call
came and invitation to a union church, so I will go.)

There were about 40 in church, and after dinner I
met quite a few people. One young man who teaches
in the Boy's School here in Lima and stays here at this
Pension walked back with me, and we got onto the
subject of why I was here, and I told him about the
Faith. He had heard of it, but knew very little about it.

To go on with my story — Mrs. Boyce took us to
immigration office and got my Passport checked-
finger prints taken, and picture and number etc. They
took quite a few soles away from me, too, and I think I
have to pay twenty more before I get my little booklet
that serves as a pass. I think I have to pay 10 soles
every month to keep it up to date. It was nice having
Mrs. Boyce along. It made things easier having the
American Consul's wife with me. She invited Mrs. Gray
and I to her house for lunch and we had a lovely time.
(Not so bad for the first day in Lima was it? I think it
was all because Mrs. Gray had seen and heard Abdul-
Baha a long time ago that it all turned out this way.
You see on board ship [sic] when she found out I was
a Bahai she had confidence in me, and it was through

her I met the American Consul's wife and was helped

> through Immigration. Mrs. Boyce gave me several
> names of connections at the University. They give a
> summer course there for about fifty soles. (Six and one
> half soles to $1). It might pay me in contacts to take a

> doesn't start until our summer. In fact it is given then
> for our benefit. People from States coming down. I can
> go and sit on any lecture, I understand, now. I won't
> know much as to what they are saying yet, but it will
> get me accustomed to sound of language, and also
> CONTACTS. I don't think there will be any objections
> to my teaching, but of course that will take time to get
> pupils. I have been sounding people out about it, and
> telling them I'd like to help pay my expenses while I'm
> studying here.

... I saw the President of Peru this morning coming

> churches. He rides about quite unprotected.

Lima is a lovely city, and so very beautiful.....56

Beginning to Work

Eve's first job as an English teacher for children of members
of the Lima Country Club was obtained by Gertrude Hanks.
Children's mothers have approached Gertrude looking for
a suitable teacher. This was Eve's first encounter with the
warmth and spontaneity of the Lima population. She was
happy because her mornings were busy and because the edu­
cation of children and young people was her professional job
which she deeply liked.

A M ajor Victory

The loneliness of being without her family and friends along
with her difficulties in communicating in the local language
were gradually overcome as she became familiar with Lima's
culture, a city with over 600,000 inhabitants. She would walk on
the streets and into contacts' homes while saying Báb's prayer
for difficulties. Eve tells us about her first months in Lima:

> It was not until the 1942 summer when the opportunity
> came to teach English at a school, and then to teach
> the same course at one of the nurses larger hospitals
> in Lima.

Schools and hospitals do not offer much
> opportunity to talk about the Bahá'í Faith, but students
> have asked me for my religion and I have made a simple
> statement. Once I gave a few words o f'Abdu'1-Bahá as
> a memorization task — those words with a universal
> message:'Light is good in whatsoever lamp it is burning!
> A rose is beautiful in whatsoever garden it may bloom!
> A star has the same radiance if it shines from the East
> or from the West.'57 As we talk about these words and
> their meanings, the girls seemed to grasp their inner
> meaning and expressed their desire to learn.

I had already met my colleagues as well as the
> mothers and fathers of my kindergarten group. At
> each time one is aware of using the art of directing a
> conversation in a way that people ask about the Faith.
> To an educator one has the opportunity to talk about
> the Bahá'u'lláh's principles of universal education, to
> an artist about the beauty of the Universal House of
> Worship, unity of mankind to those who feel tormented
> by racial prejudice, and to the refugee the hope that
justice be manifested over the earth ....

As soon as my winter classes ended, I was asked
> to teach English at the Peruvian North American
> Cultural Institute. The members are composed of a
> strong section of working people such as mail workers,
> employees, salesmen, clerks and businessmen. In one
> of the advanced courses we have been discussing
> plans for a reorganized world and reading excerpts
> from major magazines including our own World Order.
> We are following our discussions through different
> class sessions. The general consensus of opinion is that
> we must work for a lasting peace.

When a travel teacher, Philip Sprague, came to
> Lima on 23rd October 1942, we had a meeting at
> the Hotel Bolivar and 19 friends were present. Later,
> those especially interested came by invitation. At the
> table there were Americans with Peruvian names and

> more teas. This intimate and natural waý of giving the
> Message seems to draw the attention of the South
> Americans.58

In a letter to Mrs. French dated October 31, 1942, Eve
reported:

> Well, at last I feel there is a little Bahá'í light shining
> through the dark clouds of Lima. I do feel that Philip's
> [Sprague] visit was timed just right. It was really
> because of this last move that I made that I met a

Eve had been living in 119 Grimaldo del Solar Street in
the suburb of Miraflores. Her previous addresses were: 785
Conquistadores Street, San Isidro, in the autumn of 1942; and

951-5 Arequipa Avenue in Miraflores (November-December
1941). In those years, Miraflores was a suburb six miles (about
ten km) away from downtown Lima.

Eve at her home on 785 Conquistadores Street — Lima

Eve and Philip wrote to the Guardian and in response a let­
ter dated February 22,1943, was received:

Dear Bahá'í Sister,

Your letter of Oct. 24th has just been received,
> together with that of Philip, and the Guardian has
> instructed me to answer you on his behalf.

He was very happy to hear that you are now well
established in Peru, and he hopes that ere long you
will be able to confirm some of the Peruvians in the
Faith, and thus start an active and devout nucleus of
the Cause of God there.

You may be sure the Guardian will offer his ardent
and loving prayers on your behalf in the Holy Shrines,
that sincere and devout souls may be led to you and to
accept the Divine Message.

He will be pleased to hear from you and of your
work there and those whom you contact.

With Baha'i love

R. Rabbani

Dear and valued co-worker

I deeply appreciate your high endeavours and the
spirit that so admirably animates you in the service of
our beloved Faith. You are often in my thoughts and
prayers as you labour in that far-off land. Persevere in
your glorious task, and rest assured that the Beloved
will abundantly reward you for your meritorious
services.

Your true and grateful brother,

Shoghi50

Before leaving the United States, Eve was told about Alberto
Lobaton Meza a Peruvian who became a Bahá'í in 1941 in New
York. She managed to locate him later in 1945 in Lima as seen in
the next chapter. Eve realized that the only way forward was to
make contacts and friends in order to form a permanent center
of believers in the capital Lima according to the Guardian's First
Seven Year Plan. Eve, however, prayed fervently, not only for a
group but for the formation of a Local Spiritual Assembly.

1943 was a propitious year because several travel teach­
ers came to Lima to help Eve: Ettamew Lawrence on April
19,1943, and Flora Hottes on December 7,1942. Flora came
from La Paz, Bolivia, where she resided as a pioneer. Her pur­
pose in coming to Lima was taking a vacation and helping
Eve. Flora stayed until the following month. On December

10, Mary Barton also came to Lima. Eve indicated that Marcia
Steward Atwater, an American Bahá'í later the Spiritual Mother
of Chile, arrived in Lima and that the four ladies spent their
"Bahá'í Christmas"together. Flora Hottes again returns to Lima

in December 1943 for a month.

The First BaháT Center

In the spring of 1943, Eve moved from Miraflores to a classier
apartment at La Colmena Avenue 323 — apartment 405. The
move proved to be strategic as Raffo Building was located at
downtown Lima. In subsequent years the vast majority of early
Peruvian believers were confirmed in this apartment to which
Eve Nicklin gave a lot of warmth and informality. She called it
the"first Bahá'í Center"of Peru and it became the realization of
one of her dreams: having an independent place for firesides
and adorned with carpets and Peruvian handicrafts.

Raffo Building, first Lima Bahá'í Center

Flora Hottes wanted to be dose to Eve's apartment and
began looking for boarding. Eve recalled having known of
a pension house around the neighbourhood but trying to
remember the whereabouts was difficult. She said: "Well,
let's turn around this street and see whether there is a pen­
sion nearby." Flora and Eve did so, and guided by Bahá'u'lláh,
they found one at the first house they asked. The pension was
located at 815 Chancay Street. Alfredo Barreda opened the
door and told Eve that there was a vacant room. Flora Hottes
went to live there for that month. Other travel teachers also
stayed there. Over the years it was nicknamed as the "Bahá'í
pension". Alfredo worked for the government and his wife
Isabel looked after the pension.

The first Bahá'í in Peru was Maria Isabel Tirado Barreda who
enrolled on February 7, 1944, and then her husband Alfredo
Barreda on March 2,1944. Obviously Eve would have felt very
happy and blessed with these early believers that added hope
to the formation of the first Spiritual Assembly of Lima in the
next month.

Those must have been the days when Eve was well-inte­
grated into Lima's society, having an abundance of friends
and contacts. In a letter to her friend Amelia, Eve speaks of her
settlement:

> Life is more interesting. I now have here a fellow
> American who has an apartment a few blocks from
> me and we have lunch together many times. The
> government invited her to teach in the North American
> Peruvian Institute wherel teach too. Well,thereisanother
> teacher, an English woman married to a Peruvian who
> I like more. We became great friends. I was invited to a
> Peruvian party on Saturday. It was the birthday of my
> Peruvian friend Victoria ... I danced with her boyfriend
> but alas, when I was young I used to lose myself dancing
> and now it is difficult to keep the rhythm. I like it so
> much! When we danced at the Institute students want
> to dance with me. There are [the Peruvians] excellent
> dancers. I'm hoping that soon two Bahá'ís come to help
> me. There are lots of seeds sown, but it's a bit difficult
to make them sprout in the South American countries.

1944 is the centennial anniversary. A great time at the
> [Wilmette] Temple this year.Today is a holiday and I with
> my two friends are going to do some things for the Boy
> Scouts...61

Undoubtedly, she was having a great time in Lima! And by
then Eve had already won the affection of her students as they
accompanied her walking on her way home. She then would
invite them in for tea. As Eve assisted them with their English
learning the coming of Bahá'u'liáh was always brought up,
first carefully but later very openly. Her amiable character and

charisma was a magnet of attraction for all souls especially
for young people. It was in the cosy atmosphere of the Raffo
Building apartment where conditions were prepared for the
establishment of the first Spiritual Assembly of Lima in April

1944.

Ray Betts and Reginald Reindorp

A few days before Christmas John Stearns from Quito arrived
in Lima. He was the first American pioneer in Ecuador arriving
there in May of 1940. Because he was very ill with cancer and
required special medical treatment John remained in Lima.
He was interned at the Institute of Radiotherapy. Despite suf­
fering from crippling pain, John began to help Eve and also
to do business. John also established a close friendship with
Raymond (Ray) Betts and Reginald Reindorp, both Americans.
The first was the manager of the Cream Rica restaurant chain
in Lima who knew and appreciated very much the Faith thanks
to the intervention of Eve and Flora Hottes. He had lived for
twelve years in Peru and was married to a Peruvian wife, Irma.

However, for some reason Ray was undecided about taking
the big step to become a Bahál John and Ray became busi­

ness partners.

According to Eve: "It seemed to me that Ray wanted to
hear the views of a man. Then, when John Stearns arrived and
was hospitalized to undergo a treatment of radiotherapy, we
try to put in contact with each other. John recovered and soon
the two friends went to a weekend in the Baňos de Churin in
lea where Ray was confirmed in the Faith. On his return he
became Bahá'í ,.."62 Ray's enrolment in the Cause is registered

on April 20,1944. His wife Irma declared in 1946 in the United
States.

Reginald (Carl/Carlos) Reindorp (1907-1992) was the
director of Languages for an important North America -
Peruvian educational program which required him to con­
stantly travel throughout the country. He had an excellent
command of Spanish. On April 9, 1944, he delivered a live
talk at Radio Nacional on the Panamerican Day. Reginald
talked about "Prospects for the Pan American Solidarity"
elaborating about the history of Panamericanjsm and the
theme of continental unity mentioning the four freedoms
and their im portance.63 The talk closed with a long quote
on "The Destiny of America" by Shoghi Effendi and a quota­
tion from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh pointing them out as
the drive from which these ideals originated. Many friends
of the Bahá'ís coincidentally listened the talk which was also
published in the leading newspaper of Lima. The same night
Reginald joined the Faith. Virginia Orbinson relates an inter­
esting anecdote in a letter to the Inter-America Teaching
Committee dated 12 July 1944:

> I hope to go to another town here where Carlos
> [Reginald Reindorp] met a 'BaháT on one of his trips.
> He is a Peruvian living in Chiclayo, who has a shop
> in a big market. He says his brother is a Bahá'í and
> has something to do with the Temple. If you know
> anything let me know. I am going to try to find him
> again, as Carlos did not have time to get his name and
> address. As he was taking pictures in the Plaza, this
> man came up to him and said that he was a Bahá'í and
> asked Carlos if he were also one! Well, this is pioneering
> in South America - anything might happen.64

Reginald (Carl/Carlos) Reindorp

Virginia Orbinson, an American Bahá'í travel teacher on
tour in various South American counties, arrived from Bolivia
to Lima in January 1944 to assist Eve in the formation of the
first Spiritual Assembly. She was asked by the Inter America
Teaching Committee to stay for at least three months but she
remained seven months which proved to be very valuable.
This is Virginia's impression of Eve's teaching work few weeks
later:

> First I want to pay a deeply felt tribute to Eve Nicklin.
> No attempt could I make to state accurately and
> adequately her qualities, so will say only that she is
> solid, courageous, dogged in her determination to
> serve in spite of all the obstacles and difficulties she has
> had. She has a quiet and unglamorous personality and
> has had few advantages in her life, but she has made
> most extraordinary use of what she has in her favour.
> I can see very clearly now, and so can she, fortunately,
> why the way has been slow here, and the reason

> for it. The first foundation of loyal and affectionate
> friendships that she has made here with solid people
> of excellent reputation — mostly educators, and
> some families of children she has taught, plus her
> association with various well-known institutions, and
> most recently with the Peruvian-American Institute for
> Cultural Affairs, which also gives her much prestige, has
> somehow planted a seed of spiritual dynamite which is
> now set off, and is taking mighty effect (that is, in our
> small w ay!)... I can see all the steps and each one has
> been normal and right — even if slow.65

Eve recalled those days having Virginia as her associate:

> We worked together very well [with Virginia]. By that
> time I had obtained a teaching job at the first Summer
> School for teachers of English in Peru — teaching
> American literature. This enabled me to contact with
> 100 or more Peruvian teachers. Since the subject was
> about taught literature and library work, it was easy
> to introduce Virginia as guest speaker to my classes.
> Her experience as a research librarian for Paramount
> Pictures, Hollywood, gave her a good standing. She
> spoke about the research library ending with a Bahá'í
> note in her talk. I invited all who wished to come to my
> apartment to listen more, insinuating that there were
> other things interesting to hear.This was the beginning
> of a very busy time. Several activities took place such
> as talks, teas, and teaching, almost every afternoon.
Virginia and I spent "the best moments of our lives"

because the great opportunity to give the Bahá'í Faith
to Peru. These teachers were not only from Lima but

also from provinces.66

"I invited over a hundred of my contacts", is another Eve's
recollection," One night I was preparing tea repeating the
Greatest Name as she [Virginia] was giving an excellent talk".67

Virginia Orbinson relates:

> The first Bahá'í Youth Day to be held in Peru took place
> in the historic and beautiful city of Lima, on Sunday
> evening [March 12,1944], at the home of Sra. Isabel de
> Barreda and Sr. Alfredo Barreda (the first two believers
> to sign in Peru ... On this day, so near to the end of
> the first Bahá'í century, more than twenty-five young
> people gathered to hear — some for the first time — a
> short talk about the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh as the basis for
> the new world culture.

Eve Nicklin, the courageous and faithful Bahá'í
> pioneer, who has so steadfastly and selflessly built
> up the knowledge of the Faith in Lima, was of course
> present. Due to her laying of the foundation, this fine
> young people's gathering was made possible.

Seňorita Mercedes Barreda made a short
> introduction to Virginia Orbinson's talk, which
> was followed by refreshments, some singing and
> considerable discussion of the Faith, although so
> few had ever heard of it. The guests consisted of
> some young members from one hundred persons
> attending a teachers' course at the Instituto Peruano-
> Norteamericano, friends and pupils of Eve's. Sons and
> daughters of others, and friends and relatives of the
> Barredas. They are all young people of capacity and
> unusual alertness. Many wish to attend a meeting of

> Youth on the following Thursday, and out of this, we
> hope to start a regular Youth Group...68

We also know that Eve went to Arequipa and Cusco in late
March for a few days for a short vacation.

Virginia's visit can be considered as the final impulse
to achieve the formation of the Spiritual Assembly of Lima
on the first day of Ridván 1944 and therefore the begin­
ning of the Administrative Order of Bahá'u'lláh on Peruvian
soil.

On April 14, a week before the Ridván period, a
number of contacts joined the Faith: Luz Saenz, an English
teacher at the North American Peruvian Institute, Ricardo
Calderon Palma, a young man working at the New York Bank
and Eve's student, Manuel Ortiz and Georgina Bouverie,
another English teacher. On the first day of Ridván the new
Spiritual Assembly of Lima was then constituted as fol­
lows: Isabel Barreda, Raymond Betts (Coordinator), Georgina
Bouverie, Ricardo Calderon (Treasurer), Manuel Ortiz,
Reginald Reindorp (Secretary), Luz Saenz, John Stearns and
Eve Nicklin.

The pioneer was very happy, so much that she quickly
wrote to Shoghi Effendi.The victory and the trophy was hers.
Her reward was certainly his response:

Haifa May 29th 1944.

Dear Bahá'í sister:

Your welcome letter of April 23rd reached the
> Guardian; and the news you convey in it of the spread
> of the beloved Faith brought him great joy. The
> formation of an assembly in Peru was indeed a great
> victory, and added to the chain of Central and South
> American Bahá'í another precious link.

He is so happy over the work accomplished by the
valiant pioneers — and so proud of the record of the
American believers achievements: an assembly in every
province and state of N. America and a center in every
Latin Republic — and so many spiritual assemblies!

He will especially pray for you in the Shrines, and
he is deeply appreciative of all you have done for the
Cause these last few years in Peru.

With warm Bahá'í love,

R. Rabbani

Dear and valued co-worker:

Your steadfastness, your devotion, your historic
services are assets that I greatly value. I will fervently
pray that the Beloved may bless your efforts, guide
your steps, cheer your heart and fulfil your dearest
wish in His service.

Persevere in your high endeavours and rest assured
and be happy.

Your true and grateful brother.

To the Universal Friendship Club
July 28,1945

What follows after the election of the first Spiritual Assembly
of Lima was a period of intensive growth.The Assembly's first
meeting took place on April 25,1944, and its first Nineteen
Day Feast celebration three days later. They also received
a cable from Shoghi Effendi congratulating them for the
formation of their spiritual assembly marking the birth of
the Administrative Order in Peru. The beloved Guardian
sent a cable for Lima on May 27, 1944, congratulating the
new Assembly via Virginia Orbinson: "Assure Assembly lov­
ing appreciation greetings praying brilliant victories"71 And
in a letter w ritten on his behalf to Virginia dated’July 28,
1944, he wrote: "The news of the formation of the Spiritual
Assembly there (Lima) greatly rejoiced his heart, as you
already know. It is practically impossible for those who take
part in these first stirrings of the World Order of Bahá'u'lláh
in new lands to properly estimate their value and place in
history"72

In Lima the historical occasion of the Centenary of the
Faith, opened the doors to a successful public activity in the
home of the Barredas. The believers met and invited their
friends to share such an auspicious milestone in a spirit of
joy. Forty people were present and that was the first public
talk in Peru. The meeting was held on May 22 at 6:30 pm. The

program textually read:

A week before the celebration day, Alejandro Franco, an
enthusiastic young man working for the Navy, entered the
Faith. Because Manuel Ortiz eventually withdrew his name
from the Assembly, Alejandro took his place raising himself
to serve the Faith with great eagerness. He was the one sug­
gesting holding firesides in the Raffo building under the name

"Nights of Universal Friendship". By June 1944, the Assembly
had formed the Youth Committee appointing Alejandro as its
director. The idea was a great success and encouraged by the
participation, the firesides turned into a small club. Initially it
was given the name of "Little Friendship Club" to be changed
later on for the "Universal Friendship Club". A constant flow
of contacts mainly interested in learning English came to
the firesides where current affairs such as an international
language, universal brotherhood, abolition of prejudices, a
world government, and so on were discussed. The first talks
were on the inventions in the last one hundred years and the
roots of this new impulse in the world. The intention of the
club was to attract young contacts to the meetings without
presenting the Faith directly to them. They had sports and
theatre activities as well as picnics with noticeable success.
The firesides were on Wednesday nights while Saturday eve­
nings were reserved for Bahá'í meetings. According to Eve,
in that year of 1944, nearly six young people from this club
became Bahä'is.

John Stearns, on the other hand, recovered from his treat­
ment, having been several times hospitalized and subjected
to intense radiotherapy to deal with his throat cancer. He had
settled in Miraflores where he held Baha'is classes on Sunday
evenings. Also, between June and July, Ray Betts left for the
United States for several months on businesses, leaving his
wife Irma, in a house twenty minutes away from downtown
Lima. By that time Irma was studying the Faith. She and Eve
took care of John Stearns.

The First Peruvian Delegate

The All-America Centennial Convention (May 17-24, 1944)
held during the Centenary celebrations at Wilmette was called
by the Guardian and was going to congregate United States
delegates and representatives from each of the twenty Latin
American countries. Isabel Barreda was chosen five months
before by the Lima Bahá'í community to represent Peru but
she later declined due to the difficulties of the travel and her
inability to speak English. The Local Assembly of Lima then
chose Luz Saenz but she did not travel either due to miscom-
munications.73 There were representatives from Guatemala,
Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua,
Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Panama and Chile.

Because many Latin American delegates could not attend
the May celebrations in Wilmette, the National Spiritual
Assembly of the United States called for a special conference
during July, 9-15,1944. Isabel de Barreda and Raymond Betts
from Peru attended the conference as well as representatives
from Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, El Salvador, Chile, Dominican
Republic, Honduras and Paraguay.The conference engaged on

an intense consultation among the delegates and the mem­
bers of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States
towards the further development of the teaching work in
Central and South American lands. Isabel de Barreda reported
back to the community:

> Being a Bahá'í means to be a brother for all as it was
> demonstrated by the love showed to the delegates
> upon their arrival in Chicago and in the Temple. There
> were dinners and they heard the voice of 'Abdu'l-
> Bahá by the radio and saw a film where 'Abdu'l-
> Bahá was always surrounded by children. There
> was also a meeting with the National Assembly to
> discuss delegates' issues. There are thoughts about
> establishing a center in Panama and another one in
> Buenos Aires for the extension of the Bahá'í Faith. Each
> delegate received a photography of 'Abdu'1-Bahá as
> a gift. At their departure, they were farewelled with
> much love and affection. All the Bahá'ís there sent
> their loving regards. The Temple is very beautiful with
> many decorations. It was very touching to see the
> cornerstone74 in a niche where people go to pray.

The purpose of the Convention was to become
> familiar with the problems that we must confront
> in South America as well as for the delegates from
> different countries to get to know each other. The
> purpose was also that the delegates breathe that
> atmosphere and learn how to run Bahá'í matters. The
> National Assembly of the United States was satisfied
> with the information that Mrs. Barreda brought and is
> going to study all the problems and send information
> to the several communities by mail. Each delegate read
their report and noticed that all had their problems.

The minutes of the meeting dated August 1,1944, closed:
"Then a prayer for John Stearns was read who has gone to hos­
pital for an operation. Ms Nicklin also read another prayer and
the prayer for the Guardian..."76 The Prayer for the Guardian
was always said in the Assembly meetings in those years. It
reads

> That the Beloved may bestow upon our Guardian,
> Shoghi Effendi, all the strength and vigour that will
> enable him to pursue over a long and unbroken period
> of strenuous labour, the speedy triumph of the Cause
> of Bahá'u'lláh.

This prayer was the believers' adaptation of what Shoghi
Effendi wrote in 1923: "I cherish the hope that, from now on,
the Beloved may bestow upon me all the strength and vigor
that will enable me to pursue over a long and unbroken period
of strenuous labour the supreme task of achieving, in collabo­
ration with the friends in every land, the speedy triumph of
the Cause of Bahá'u'lláh.This is the prayer I earnestly request
all my fellow-brethren and sisters in the Faith to offer on my
behalf."77

A Bahá'í Community in the Making

And as the number of believers increased, Eve was feeling
more confirmed in her pioneering services. "The simple fact
to hear the name of Bahá'u'lláh in people's lips was a reason
for much joy and happiness", commented Eve Nicklin, "And
later, when people exhibited the photo of 'Abdu'1-Bahá or the
Greatest Name, the emotion was indescribable.... I used to say
'Thanks to Thee Bahá'u'lláh, the Faith is established in Peru'".78

Passing of John Steams

It was July 1944 when John Stearns's condition deteriorated.
At the beginning of August he was operated on but his health
kept getting worse until his passing on November 7,1944, at
4:45 pm at the age of 37 years. The burial was a simple cer­
emony in the Callao British cemetery on the following day at
4:30 pm with his friends present.

The Guardian sent a cable to the Bahá'í world mourning
the loss of this valuable pioneer:

> RADIANT SELFLESS SERVICES DEAR JOHN STEARNS
> WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN COUNTRY INDEED BLESSED
> WHERE PIONEER NOT ONLY TAUGHT BUT REMAINED
> DIED STILL GLORIFYING HIS FAITH.79

In a cable dated November 19,1944, Shoghi Effendi said:

> SHARE GRIEF AT PASSING OF DEVOTED, FAITHFUL
> PIONEER [JOHN STEARNS] HIS SERVICES HAVE BEEN
> UNFORGETTABLE AND HIGHLY MERITORIOUS. ADVISE
> THE CONSTRUCTION OF A MEMORIAL. ASSURE FRIENDS
> IN LIMA [Peru] MY DEEPEST, LOVING SYMPATHY.80

The Assembly of North America sent the following cable:

> HEARTFELT SYMPATHY GRIEVOUS LOSS HEROIC
> SELF   SACRIFRICING    BAHAI PIONEER  JOHN
> STEARNS HIS DEATH LIGHTS ONE MORE SPIRITUAL
> BEACON ILLUMINATING PATH UNITY AMERICAS IN
> BAHA'U'LLAH'S REVELATION 81

On August 14,1945, Eve Nicklin received the following let­
ter from the beloved Guardian in response to her report on
John Stearns:

Dear Bahá'í Sister:

Your letter of Nov. 9th, 1944, reached Haifa some
> time ago, but due to pressure of work the Guardian has
> not been able this winter and spring to attend to his
> mail promptly, otherwise he would have written you
> before. He feels sure you will understand the delay was
> not caused by any other reason!

He was very sorry to hear of the death of John
> Stearns; he was a fine believer, and it is a pity he should
> have passed away so young — but his reward is assured
> and his name will be forever preserved in the roll call of
> the early Bahá'í pioneers to South America.

The news of the progress of the Cause in Peru
> greatly pleased him, and he hopes that on the modest
> but sound foundation that has been laid there a
> flourishing and exemplary community will arise and
> reward you and the other dear friends for your devoted
> and unsparing labours.

You may be sure he will certainly pray for you and
for the success of the fine work you are doing there.

Please convey his loving greetings to all the dear
Bahá'ís there.

With warm Bahá'í love,

•R. Rabbani

May the Beloved bless your efforts in the service

Your true brother,

Shoghi82

John Stearn, Spiritual Father of Ecuador

We also read that Eve writes to Rodella Stearns, John's
mother, in truly moving terms which reveals the stress of
those months:

j

I think I understood John very well, especially when
he came this way for the first time and I was his only
friend. I realized certain tim idity and reserve that he
maintained. He came one year ago to this time. One
day I went to the post office and found a letter from
John asking me to visit him in the hospital. I had
the opportunity to meet with him at your home in
Jamestown. You were absent in that time, but Fred
(Kings) and Audrey and the McKays were there.

John came to Lima with great hopes to get well
very soon. He had had treatments in the beginning
with X-rays and thought that would be everything. I
guess that he got tired in Ecuador. Well, things did not
happen as fast as John had hoped. Then the time came
when doctors said to John that eleven radium needles
had to be put in his tongue. The treatments had not
had the reaction that they should have. He would
humorously call the needles his"phonograph needles"
— but they were no joke, because he had to have them
for three days. I never saw somebody so patient and
without complaining like John. X-rays burned their
neck and throat to the extent that at times he could
not eat or speak. I knew shortly after that he was near
to dying at that time.

I was going to see him every day and used to bring
things to him - Coca Cola, milkshakes, custards, but I
guess he did not like them due to his burned throat.
The treatment took weeks in the hospital. That was
the time when I called a friend Mr. Betts, so that he
could come and see John (at the beginning of 1944).

I thought that John needed a man. They became very
close friends and were together in businesses.

It was certainly a miracle that he left the hospital
(July 19,1944). We asked the Guardian for his prayers
and he said that he was praying fervently but never had
he assured to us that he would be better. In fact, we felt
that there was a reason why John became better that
first time, because it was through John that Mr. Betts
became a confirmed believer. John was very happy
with him. We knew from him that John was in pain but
that he strived to hide it.

It was not then a surprise when he said one day to
me that he was going to return to the hospital for a
control, as he called it. I knew then that he was very
serious. He had cancer in his neck (beginnings of
August of 1944) and they operated... By this time Mr.
Betts had gone to the United States. His wife, Irma and
a friend Cora Wilson and I myself were in the hospital
while John was being operated on. He was on the table
from nine until four. As you know, they cut muscles
from his neck. They should have never operated on
him completely. The cut muscles caused his neck to
incline to the side. He was very impatient with himself
and the hospital became tired of him. You could not
reproach him. So we transferred him to the American
hospital. He liked its atmosphere but still he thought
that they were not doing anything for him. You will see
he never resigned his hopes, which is typical of people
with cancer, and that he never admitted what he had.
He referred it to me as a tumour.

Irma Betts felt so much pain for him that he had to
take him to her house. We tried to suggest to him to
return home to the United States before it was too late.
The situation was very complicated. He did not admit
defeat. He seemed to wish to live so much.

John could rise and walk to the small patio in Irma's
house and sit under the sun. Visiting him became very
difficult because he could not speak much and we did
not know when our presence was irritating to him. So
we had to take him back to the hospital as the pain was
increasingly stronger and Irma could not take care of
him anymore.

We managed to get a doctor who would come to
give him injections. We knew that it would be difficult
because he hated hospitals. They gave him a strong
injection to force him to enter the hospital. He did not
allow me to help him to come down the stairs. Always
he wished to do things by himself. And I always let him
do what he wished. If he wished that I read, I did it or
not; talk or not — and I guess he appreciated this.

John called to me so that I can help him to enter the
taxi. We knew that the reaction would begin as soon
as the injection had effect, but he entered the hospital
and seemed comfortable and jovial.

He did not live much longer and he was delirious
until the last moment. Irma, Cora and I were with him
when he died and he passed away very peacefully.
So we were very thankful because we thought that
possibly he would choke.

The Guardian wrote that he wished to assure to the
friends in Lima of his deep and loving sympathy and
advised the construction of a monument.

Your daughter spoke about wishing to place a
gravestone. How would you wish to do it? Would it
be convenient if Bahá'ís erect a monument with your
advice? Also, would you mind having the GREATEST
NAME engraved and some words of the Bahá'í
Teachings? There is no great haste. Ray Betts and I will
ask for prices and other details.

I am certain that the reason for which John never
wrote to you anymore was because he did not want
to worry you - actually, he said that to me. I guess that
his experiences in South America somehow soothed
him. When some people in the beginning become
Bahä'is, they cannot see why the entire world does not
see the same thing. As the time goes by, they get to
understand more, perhaps.

Tell all the Bahá'ís in Jamestown that I send them
my love. If Doris and Willard return there please give
them my love.

Ray and Irma were so good with John - they were
like family. Ray feels so thankful to John for the part
he played in convincing him about the Faith. Irma is
not a Bahál She would like to believe, but one thing or
another interposes on the way.

With love to you and prayers for your peace,

Ray Betts had returned from the United States but had
to be hospitalized immediately due to bad health and there­
fore could not attend the funeral. In May 1945 the Betts
returned to the United States and bought a farm in East
Bern in New York. The July 1980 issue of The American Baha'i
reported his death as being on November 19, 1979, in East
Berne, New York. Irma Betts passed away on April 9, 2006, in
East Berne being 91 years of age. The May 1981 Baha'i News
issue also carries the news of Ray Betts' passing in the article
"Rabbani" by Stephen Waite about the Rabbani School at
Gwalior, India:

> ... Ray Betts, a 71-year-old pioneer from the U.S.
> and Belize who had years of experience in tropical
> agriculture. Mr. Betts spent nearly a year at the Rabbani
> School improving the soil and fruit trees, introducing
> composting and the use of natural fertilizers and
> mulching. With great humour, he persevered through
> the trials of inspection by curious villagers, and being
> hard of hearing, which made learning a new language
> quite difficult. Mr. Betts recently passed on to the Abhá
> Kingdom.84

Four months later, Virginia Orbinson left Peru en route to
Bolivia having made magnificent work. She returned to Lima
in October on her way to Ecuador for ten days. Virginia eventu­
ally settled in Spain and became its Spiritual Mother.

At the death of John Stearns, DemetrioTaboada of Callao
was elected as his replacement in the Assembly. Demetrio had
enlisted in the Cause on November 4, three days before his
election to the Assembly and had been attending the meetings
at Eve's apartment becoming soon an enthusiastic supporter.

He was Alfredo Barreda's friend and bank colleague. Alfredo
took him to Eve's meetings. Demetrio related that in order to
be accepted as a new Bahá'í the candidate would have to read
certain books such as Baha'u'llah and the New Era and the Will
and Testament of Abdu'1-Bahá. At a meeting with the Spiritual
Assembly questions were asked regarding the books, after
which he had to request their acceptance as a new member.

We also know that by November, the Assembly librarian
informs that copies of "The Wisdom of 'Abdu'1-Bahá" have
been sent to the libraries of the Military School of Chorrillos
and the National Pedagogical Institute. According to Eve,
1945 "was a time to attract new members, learning respon­
sibilities through team work, deepening themselves in our
Faith."85 That was the year in which the community grew up
to 23 believers and received the visit of several Bahá'ís. Jorge
Sarco Manrique from Guayaquil, Ecuador, came on February
26; Gwenne Dorothy Sholtis on July 8 for one week; Elizabeth
Cheney, a pioneer to Paraguay, on October 18; and Virginia
Orbinson on April 7 and again on October 25. Similarly, Haig

Kevorkian arrived from Argentina on November 15 for one
week en route to his pioneering post in Ecuador, and Emeric

Salas and his wife in December.

Mrs. Braddock and 'Abdďl-Bahá

In the previous chapter we saw how, on her journey to Lima in
October of 1941, Eve met a lady by the name of Mrs. Gray who
had known 'Abdu'1-Bahá in the Holy Land. Eve experienced
a similar anecdote when she'encountered another lady who
had also known the Master. Mrs. Braddock was visiting a house
in Lima when suddenly she read the name o f'Abdu'1-Bahá in

a book. Being very surprised, she pronounced His name so
loudly that her host was prompted to ask Mrs. Braddock what
was happening. Mrs. Braddock then tells her host that she had
known 'Abdu'1-Bahá and asked her where she had obtained
the book. That is how she learns of Eve Nicklin and decides
with her daughter to meet her. Eve related later:

> A book lay open on the small table beside her chair. Mrs.
> Braddock glanced down at it. Suddenly, a name was
> alive on the printed page.'"Abdu'1-Bahá!" She spoke the
> name aloud. Her hostess looked up from her knitting.
> "What did you say, my dear?""The name in this book!"
> she said,"'Abdďl-Bahá — I knew Him. Where did you get
> this book?""A woman lent it to me," Mrs. Braddock and
> her daughter found their way to the Bahá'í Center. She
> told us of her life as a young Armenian woman, living in
> Egypt, of her visits with 'Abdu'1-Bahá and His family in
> Haifa, Palestine. "Although I was just a child, I remember
> Him too," said the daughter. "I remember Him too," said
> the daughter. "I remember sitting at His feet with the
> other children." She added, "And He gave me a ring-
> stone that I treasured very much." We showed them
the Baha'i World books. How eagerly Mrs. Braddock

searched through them for pictures of familiar faces!
There was an especial face that she wanted to find —

Lua Getsinger."Lua was a guest in our house," she said,
"and it was there that she died." "We all loved her very

> much," she added softly. We told her that Lua had been
> named The Mother Teacher of The West.86

Mrs. Braddock invited us unto her home to meet her
> husband, an Englishman.They showed us their albums
> of photographs. One picture was of 'Abdďl-Bahá

> walking along a path, His cloak billowing in the wind.
> Mrs. Braddock seemed surprised when we informed her
> that the Faith which 'Abdu'1-Bahá had advanced, was
> becoming recognized around the world. She had not
> thought much about religion through the years, but
> she had often remembered the way of life exemplified
> by 'Abdu'l-Bahá. His selfless life of service had said
> louder than words that He was a Bahá'í; she could not
> speak His name without betraying her emotion. To us,
> who had not known'Abdu'1-Bahá personally, yet loved
> him with an overwhelming love, Mrs. Braddock had
> brought another glimpse of His Matchless example of
> Bahá'í living. We in turn, shared with the Braddocks, His
> writings.87

Eve and the Children

In 1945 Eve published in Lima a children's book entitled
Read Me a Story in both English and Spanish. The printing
of the book was possible through Irene Silva de Santolalla's
assistance.

Irene (1904-1992) was a prominent educationalist and
feminist. A member of Lima's upper class and intelligen­
tsia, Irene became in 1956 the first woman to be elected to
the Peruvian Senate and had been named the Woman of the
Americas also in 1956. An author and a sought-after lecturer
in Peru and overseas, she wrote many books and articles on
family education and child development. Her name is men­
tioned in a letter from Shoghi Effendi quoted in the next
chapter.

Irene Silva de Santolalla

Dr. Aguilar had introduced Irene to Eve and soon they
became good friends. Although a very close admirer of the
Teachings, Irene never became a Bahá'í. She prologued the
book by describing Eve Nicklin as "a specialist in story-telling
and children books. She is well acquainted with child psy­
chology issues due to her vast experience working daily with
them. She has been a pre-school supervisor and consultant
for youth summer schools, both for boys and girls, in the state
of Pennsylvania of the United States of North America."88

Eve wrote:

> Irene is a well-known writer of books on parent
> education. We were having tea together; our talk
> centered on the topic of education. I brought out stories
> that had been prepared for pre-school children, and let
> her read them, commenting that Bahá'ís believe that
> character-training is of paramount importance, that
> accordingly the aim of these stories was to influence
> the child to keep his word, to be on time, and to be
thoughtful of all creatures. Then I quoted from The

Wisdom of'Abdu'l-Bah&Z'For unless the moral character
of a nation is educated, as well as the brain, and talents,
civilization has no basis." Irene was thoughtful. "My
people here in Peru need this type of training,"she said,
"May I translate these stories into Spanish? I'll help you
have them printed too," she added. After much labor
the task was finished. It is dedicated to an organization
that Irene had founded, "The Crusade of Education for
the Future Mothers of Peru,"and also to that generation
of children that will makeanewand betterworld.lnthe
prologue of the little book, one may read Irene's own
words,"... thinking people everywhere are realizing the
importance of child-training as a firm basis for a better
hum anity89

Book cover of "Read Me a Story" by Eve Nicklin

Eve's talents in education constituted the foundation of
future children's classes in Peru which started at her apartment
classes. According to one of the first believer's testimony:

> I already had the idea that if the Faith spread roots
> in the children we would have not to worry as much,
> because each of those children was going to be a pillar,
> because each child would begin to live with their faith!
> .... In one of the meetings, as we were exchanging

> said it in English. So we decided to carry out the plan.
> As of a Sunday, we invited the children for tea. Then
> we decided to do it every Sunday; and so Sundays
were like madness [because of the children]. Then we

decided that parents send their children to a matinee
function. And so children began to arrive and lots of

> games were played... that Eve Nicklin knew, because

> there was a cake shop that until now exists. I went and
> got cakes (the bakery trusted us).... Later we made the
> collection and we paid — that was not the collection
> of the Nineteen Days.90

Consolidating the Community

According to Eve, 1946 was a year full of promises of increased
Bahá'í activity:

> In January members of the community began giving
> their own talks. Up to now we have had our regular
> classes of Saturdays led by me only, but the great
> day came when Dr. Aguilar [a new Bahá'í] announced
> that he was now ready to lead one of the meetings.
> His topic was'Divine Economy'... and he did it so well
> that we are hoping to have him speaking more often.
> Manuel Vera (our capable translator) took the next
> talks on'Evolution of the Thought'. The way he answers
> questions shows that he is obtaining a deep knowledge
> of the Faith. Mary Angulo (Beckett) and Albert Lobaton
> are the next speakers. The deepening classes are on
> Thursdays. People come on Mondays for a study circle
> and on Wednesdays for the Club evenings.91

In August of 1946 the Bahá'ís of Lima initiated the pro­
ceedings for the official recognition of the Bahá'í Faith at the
Religious Affairs Department. After intense activities they
formally received the news that no registration was needed
because in Peru there is freedom of religion. However any pub­
licity should have first the Governor's permission. In any case,
we found that on December 30, 1947, the "Bahá'í Assembly
(NUR)" is formed and incorporated on the Public Records on
February 12,1948, as a cultural association. These steps were
explored by the Local Assembly as the Lima Bahá'ís began
considering expanding the Faith to other cities such as Cusco,
Huancayo and Callao. In October 1946 Eve visited Trujillo to

see possibilities of moving to this northern city, but appar­
ently nothing eventuated.

One of Eve's strengths was her professional training with
children and youth. She had a way to establish a quick rap­
port with young people as well as a repertoire of activities to

work with them. That is how the early years of the Peruvian
Bahá'í community were energized through the active partici­
pation of the youth. A particular approach she developed was
making pictorial albums to illustrate Bahá'í concepts to her
contacts. It might have been a reaction to her poor Spanish
speaking skills or that she found visual means more effective
to teach people. In any case, Eve developed the skill of creat­
ing very appealing albums on a broad range of topics, quoting
Bahá'í writings along with paper clips she cut from magazines
and newspapers.

Eve always found an interesting way to deliver Bahá'í
concepts to the youth. For example the celebration of the
Declaration of the Báb on May 23, 1947, was portrayed in a
small drama where telegrams were prepared beforehand. At
the night of the anniversary, Bahá'ís and their friends each
received a message taken from "The Wisdom of 'Abdu'1-Bahá".
This was meant to symbolize the Declaration of the Báb, the
birth of'Abdu'1-Bahá and the delivering of the first telegraphic
message.

Another opportunity arose when theyouth of the Universal
Friendship Club asked Eve to celebrate Christmas at the Bahá'í
Cénter. Eve, in her wisdom, did not refuse their request but
let them prepare tea and have a small celebration. The Bahá'í
youth were in charge of the program. At a signal, the electric
light was turned off and a great white candle was lit while all
the guests gathered around forming a circle.

*   According to Eve,

> The brightness of the central light reflected on the
> faces of the young people as they were told a history of

> the coming to Earth of a progression of great prophets
> and messengers of the Light, such as Moses, Christ,
> Muhammad, the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh. When the history
> finalized, four young people, representing the East, the
> West, the North and the South, brought their candles
> forward and lit them from the central light; then
> they ignited the smaller candles held by each guest,
> symbolizing the diffusion of the light of the truth of the
> w orld... Tied to each small candle there was a message
> of Light from the Pens of the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh and
> 'Abdu'1-Bahá. A special guest was the Bahá'í instructor
> Gwenne Sholtis. She led the young people to sing the
> Song of Love of Nina Benedict Mattson.92

We also find that:"... they [Peruvians] used the method of
discussions at round tables in their public meetings of every
week.The Peruvians enjoyed taking part in the talks and visual
aids were used. Mario Rodriguez, with a special talent for the
art, painted announcements and graphical letters for this pur­
pose. Graphic talks were given to explain the Teachings more
comprehensively."93

Eve's Universal Friendship Club kept growing and yielded
the Lima Bahá'í youth group as its finest fruit. Through his let­
ters to Eve, Shoghi Effendi also educated them —at a time
when there was no Bahá'í literature in Spanish — as it seems
in this letter from his secretary on November 17,1947:

> There are so many movements in the world at present
> akin to various Bahá'í principles, indeed we can almost
> say thatthe principles of Bahá'u'lláh have been adopted
> by thinking people all over the planet. But what they
> do not realize, and what the Bahá'ís must therefore

teach them, is that these principles, however perfect,
will never be able to create a new society, unless and
until they are animated by the spirit which alone
changes the hearts and characters of men, and that
spirit is recognition of their Divine origin in the teacher
sent from God; in other words, Bahá'u'lláh. When they
recognize this, their hearts will change and a change
of heart is what people need, not merely a change of
intellectual outlook.94

MOTHER OF PERU

Before leaving the United States, Eve was told that there
were three Peruvian Bahá'ís, namely, Octavio lllescas, Pacora
Blue Mountain (Salomon Pacora Estrada) and Alberto
Lobaton who had accepted the Faith in that country. These
early believers were already shining in the field of teaching
particularly in regard to Latin American populations. More
importantly, those stories reveal the bridge that despite
of the distance God was building between the more estab­
lished North American Bahá'í community and the nascent
South American ones.

With Eve's arrival new believers came into the Faith who
soon became engaged in the service to the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh.
Watching them to grow into fine believers brought much
happiness to her heart. It was another confirmation that her
services were accepted and blessed. For these new converts,
Eve became the epitome of their new espoused Faith from

whom guidance and inspiration were drawn. Like a mother
carefully looking after the development of her children, Eve
demonstrated great patience and forbearance. That was at a
time when there was no Bahá'í literature in Spanish and no
strong local administrative structures to rely upon. Money was
also short but Eve offered the little she had to provide an envi­
ronment where these new believers felt comfortable enough
to meet and learn to live as a community. She superbly
succeeded because it was done with immense and pure
love.

Octavio lllescas

Octavio lllescas and his wife, Inga lllescas, were enlisted
in the Bahá'í Faith on January 29, 1940. At that time he was
residing in Beverly Hills, a prosperous community adja­
cent to Los Angeles, and was therefore a member of that
locality. Octavio had emigrated from Peru as a single man
in 1910.

The lllescas became members of the Bahá'í community of

4       <r

Los Angeles on January 21, 1941, when they moved to that
city. They apparently remained in that community until 1946.
On July 21,1946, they transferred from the Los Angeles com­
munity to the city of Clovis. Clovis is a small city to the north
of San Francisco in the north of California. They were both the
only Bahá'ís in that locality.

Octavio might have moved to Fresno in that year because
his wife died of cancer in a hospital in that city on November 1,
1946\. He was still apparently in contact with the Bahá'ís of Los
Angeles at that time because the Local Assembly and Bahä'is
sent flowers for her funeral.95 By 1947 we find that Octavio
lllescas was serving as a special consultant for South America
at the Inter-America Teaching Committee. Eve and Octavio
never met.

We know that Inga was a member of the 1943 Inter-
America Committee along with her husband. We also know
that Octavio was the coordinator of the Inter-AmericaTeaching
Committee in 1945. In the "Bahá'í World" we read that Octavio
lllescas along with Dorothy Baker were teaching in Mexico and
after her return, he remained "several weeks with the believers
in Mexico City, further encouraging and strengthening them
with his loving sympathy, wisdom and clear understanding of
the Bahá'í Faith."96Octavio also went travel teaching to Havana.
Octavio lllescas is known to be the first Peruvian Bahá'í.

According to the September 1940 Baha'i/Vews:"Mr. Illescas
who is a native of Peru and a graduate of the University of
Minnesota and therefore well qualified to offer the most
valuable advice to those contemplating service in this glori­
ous field."97 At the Centenary he gave a talk indicating that
"The religious heritage, the known fervor and devotion of the
masses, in the Latin American nations will be the fertile soil
on which the seeds of the Bahá'í Faith, a religion of action, a
religion in which service to humanity is worship of God — will
grow and bear rich fruits."98

Alberto Lobaton

The story of Alberto Lobaton and Pacora Blue Mountain goes
back to New York, the City of the Covenant. It is equally inter­
esting and helps us see the Hand of God mysteriously raising
from North America the pillars of the Faith in Peru. Let's listen
to Alberto Lobaton's oral version:

> We [Alberto Lobaton and Pacora Blue Mountain] gave
> an Inca music concert in New York. And that pleased
> much the secretary of the Spiritual Assembly Bahá'í of
> New York who was present there at that time. Then she
> invited us to participate in a literary-musical evening
> function that was being organized by the Spiritual
> Assembly Bahá'í of New York; and we attended. Pacora
> Blue Mountain ... that played the piano very well,
> was a great pianist, and I played the quena. And the
> secretary of the Spiritual Assembly Bahá'í of New York
> liked [the presentation] very much because she was
> of Persian origin and she said to me that there was a

Mother of Peru

> great similarity between the Peruvian and the Persian
> music. Then we were there [at the Bahá'ís meetings]
> and we became familiar with the ideas, the doctrines,
> the ideals of the Baha'i Faith, about what the Bahá'í
> Faith advocates. We agreed immediately. Then, just
> a short time later, we had already signed our cards
> as members of the Spiritual Assembly Bahá'í of New
> York. First me and then Blue Mountain. His enlisting
> was almost immediately because this Mr. Saffá Kinney,
> 99 that was the coordinator of the Spiritual Assembly,
> was a man of a great culture and a great gentleman.
> Immediately he won our affection. We got along with
> him very well. And it did not take much when we were
already performing in the meetings of the Bahá'í Faith

in New York.100

Alberto, or "Albert", worked in the School of Tourist Guides
of Lima where he met Julia Mendoza, a Bahá'í. Since his arrival,
Alberto was looking for the Lima believers till Julia mentioned
Eve Nicklin to him. Simultaneously, Eve had been looking for
Alberto based on the information provided to her by the Inter
America Teaching Committee before her travelling to Peru.
However, she had been looking for him by Alberto's mater­
nal surname, that is, Meza. Alberto's membership to the Lima
community is dated August 1945. Since then Alberto became
Eve's right arm as her translator in Bahá'í classes and public
talks.

Meche Sanchez and Alberto Lobaton in the late 1990s

The Second Seven Year Plan initiated in 1946 — after a
two-year "truce" — contemplated among its four objectives
the formation of three new national spiritual assemblies, one
in Canada, another one in Central America and the third one
in South America. 101 In November of 1946 the first Bahä'i
South American Congress took place in Buenos Aires. There
were four consecutive congresses which culminated with
the election of the first National Spiritual Assembly of South
America for ten countries in 1951.102 Alberto Lobaton was the
official Peruvian delegate but Roque Jimenez also attended.
According to Alberto's reminiscences, the Congress was very
moving and a series of public talks were held on various prem­
ises with a diverse public. He traveled by land up to Puno on
the border with Bolivia, crossed the Titicaca Lake by boat and
took the train to La Paz, capital of Bolivia. In La Paz, Alberto
stayed with the Cuellar Family and from there he went by train
to Buenos Aires arriving after four days.

Mother of Peru

A gifted public speaker, Alberto was blessed with two let­
ters of Shoghi Effendi in 1946 and 1947. The second letter
dated February 18,1947, reads:

Dear Bahá'í Brother:

Your letter dated Oct. 14th was received by our
> beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer
> it on his behalf.

News of the wonderful success of the Buenos Aires
> Conference has already reached him, and he feels that
> it truly marks a turning point in the development of
> the work in South America. It also has demonstrated
> that the believers of Latin America are going to be able
> to not only elect their two national assemblies, when
> the time comes, but will be capable of managing the
> affairs of the Cause in these republics of the New World
> with dignity, efficiency and success.

The news you gave him of the teaching work being
> carried on by your Assembly in Callao 103 gave him great
> satisfaction. This work is of the utmost importance, and
> he assures he will pray that it may be very successful, and
> that a flourishing Bahá'í Community may soon exist there.

Your donation to, and love for, our glorious Cause
> touches him deeply and he will pray that your services
> may be richly blessed by Bahá'u'lláh.

With warm Bahá'í love,

R. Rabbani

Assuring you of my deep and abiding appreciation
> of your meritorious and historic services to our beloved
> Faith, and of my fervent prayers for your successful and
> the speedy realization of every hope you cherish for its
> extension and promotion,

Your true and grateful brother,

Pacora Blue Mountain

According to Eve, Alberto "knew of the Cause from one of
those famous Sunday meetings that took place in the house
of the Kinneys in New York" and that Pacora Blue Mountain
(1899-1969) took him there.

The Hand of the Cause of God 'Amatu'1-Bahá Rúhíyyih
Khánum once stated: "The Beloved Guardian considered Mr.
Pacora Blue Mountain to be the first known Bahá'í of Inca
descent, and for this reason has a photograph of Mr. Pacora
Blue Mountain placed in the Mansion of Bahji where it may
still be seen".105 From 1941 to his death on Christmas 1961,
Pacora Blue Mountain brilliantly served the Faith as a pioneer
in Ecuador. As seen earlier, his confirmation in the Faith took
place in the home of Safá Kinney. On August 9, 1941, Safá
Kinney wrote to the beloved Guardian:

Pacora Blue Mountain, an ... Inca Indian, has been
> most important in the spread of the Cause in both
> Mexico and South America. He is a faithful attendant to
> my meetings and absorbs deeply all I have had to say.
> ... I have been giving out the strongest kind of spiritual
> food, dealing with actualities and truth — indeed, he
> says it was just that which made him a Bahá'í106

The Guardian through his secretary responded to Safá
Kinney two months later:

The Guardian was most happy to learn that you
> have been able to confirm souls from South American
> countries, such as Mr. Blue Mountain and Mr.Torres. He
> will pray for their dedication to the wonderful work of
> spreading their new-found belief in Bahá'u'lláh amidst
> their countrymen who so greatly need these glorious
> Teachings. He was particularly happy than Mr. Blue
> Mountain, an Inca descendant, should have embraced
> the Cause, thus bringing nearer the realization of the
> Master's command to confirm the Indians"107

And on March 28,1942,

> He [Shoghi Effendi] was very happy to hear of the
> successful teaching work which Mr. Blue Mountain is
> carrying on. The conversion of the original inhabitants
> of North America and South America to the Faith is a
> cause for great rejoicing, and will no doubt bring rich
> blessings in its wake.108

In "Heroes of God" Helen Hornsby describes what hap­
pened to Pacora Blue Mountain after his enrolment into the
Faith:

> After becoming a Bahá'í, he spent most of his time in
> small towns teaching the Faith. He would return home
> on weekends and give concerts for crippled children
> and at other hospitals. He married an Ecuadorian
> young woman and after that he always wanted to
> pioneer to her country.

In March 1961 he came to Ecuador as a pioneer and
> at Ridván he was elected to be a member of the local
> Assembly of Guayaquil. He was so well liked by the
> Bahá'í s and appreciated that the local Assembly made
> an official request to the National Assembly that he
> be allowed to remain with them in that city. However,
> Pacora enjoyed working in the more primitive areas
> of the country and devoted time to the community of
> Naranjapata where he kept a room for Bahá'í meetings.
> During the year, he was privileged to attend the first
> major Indian Teaching Congress in Ecuador at San
> Pablo near Otavalo.

While in Guayaquil, he gave many piano concerts
> interspersed with the Bahá'í writings and also radio
> programs on "Ondas del Pacifico" (The Waves of the
> Pacific). He received many letters from the Guardian,
> Shoghi Effendi, to whom he was extremely devoted
> and he composed a chant for the Guardian entitled "Ya
> Shoghi Effendi Val-e-Amrollah." Ruhíyyíh Khánum said
> that the Guardian loved him so much.109

On January 13,1970, the Universal House of Justice wrote
to the National Spiritual Assembly of Ecuador: "His long and
devoted services to the Faith in Latin America and in Ecuador ’
will be long remembered". Before passing away, Pacora Blue
Mountain, donated his property in Sullana, Piura, his native
town, to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Peru
to be used as a Bahá'í center. He visited Lima once in the 1960s.

Dr. Guillermo Aguilar

Returning to the Lima of 1945, two other outstanding enrol­
ments were Manuel Vera and Guillermo Aguilar. Manuel was a
young man who rapidly understood the teachings of the Faith.
He acquired a deep Bahá'í knowledge becoming Eve's capable
and enthusiastic translator at the Universal Friendship Club.
Eventually he traveled to the United States and settled there.

Dr. Aguilar was a prominent new enrolment who joined
the ranks of the early Peruvian Bahá'í community. He was born
in the Peruvian highlands and held a doctorate in economics
from Sorbonne University being a professor at the University
of San Marcos. From the very first moment of his Bahá'í life,

Dr. Aguilar was conscious of the step that he had taken when
accepting Bahá'u'lláh. He was a gifted public speaker. He had
recalled the events that led to his encounter with the Cause
of God.

> I wentto improve my command of the English language
> in the North American Peruvian Institute where I met
> Eve Nicklin. I had requested [the Institute] to have
> a native English teacher to acquire the accent. And
> they directed me to Miss Eve Nicklin. In the following
> months I tried to learn as much as I could from her and

> so different from which I had acquired until that date,
> that I liked them and I began to frequent her company
> so that she continues speaking to me of the Bahá'í
> Faith".110

At that time, Dr. Aguilar along with his wife belonged to
a prominent political party. He might have felt concerned
whether belonging to a political party was compatible with
the teachings of the Faith. She consulted with Eve and both
turned to Shoghi Effendi for guidance. As a result the follow­
ing letter dated November 17,1945, was received.

Cause of God Mr. Hasan Balyuzi, Lima, 1961

Dear Bahá'í Sister:

The Guardian was very happy to receive your letter
of Aug. 17th, together with that of the Bahá'í youth, and
to see how well the Cause is progressing there.

Regarding your reference to Dr. Aguilar, who seems
to be a very enlightened and sincere man, the Guardian
feels that you might point out to him that if he, as a
Bahá'í, should insist on the right to support a certain
political party whose platform he considers highly
meritorious, he cannot very well deny the same degree
of freedom to other believers; which would mean that
within the ranks of a Faith whose primary objective is
to unite all men as one great family under God, there

would be Bahá'ís opposed to each other, and because
of the very nature of politics, in violent disagreement
with each other. Where then would lie the example of
harmony and unity for which the world is seeking?

The Guardian will pray that Dr. Aguilar may feel
moved to sacrifice his political associations in order to
fully support the Divine system which is the remedy for
all the ills of all the people in the world. He will also pray
that your friend Irene Silva de Santolalla will feel moved
to courageously espouse the Faith which she so admires.

Your long and patient service in Peru has yielded
a fruitful harvest, and the Guardian is very pleased
over the reports you have given him. He feels you are
the best to decide whether you should at present go
home for a rest or not, as you can better judge if your
temporary absence will seriously affect the work there
or not. Meantime you may be sure he will pray for your
continuous success, guidance, and health.

With warm Bahá'í love,

R. Rabbani

P.S.: He thinks it would be an excellent idea to
translate some of the teachings into the native Indian
languages.

With the assurance of my lively and abiding
appreciation of your truly remarkable efforts and
services, and of my continued and fervent prayers for
the extension of your valued activities, and the full

> realization of your dearest hopes in the service of our
> beloved Faith,

Your true and grateful brother,

Shoghi Effendi's words brought reassurance to
Dr. Aguilar's heart and consequently he resigned from his
political affiliations while Eve put aside a possible trip to the
United States. He became an active believer and for many
years he served on the Spiritual Assembly of Lima and the
National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Peru. He was
also elected in 1952 to the National Spiritual Assembly for
ten South American countries along with Eve Nicklin. In
addition, Dr. Aguilar acted as the Peruvian representative to
the United Nations in Lima. The January 1953 issue of Bohďí
News reports that: "In Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Mr. Guillermo
Aguilar, former chairman of the Lima, Peru, local Assembly
has been directing the establishment of a technological
school for Haiti on behalf of the United Nations. He has been
very active in Baha'i work in the Port-au-Prince Community,
and has spoken on the United Nations."112 Dr. Aguilar died
in 1988 aged 86 years old in Lima after a long service to the
Cause of Bahá'u'lláh.

Mercedes (Meche) Sanchez113

Meche (1912-1999) joined the Faith in Lima, Peru, on
Christmas 1946 through Eve's club. As seen earlier, Eve Nicklin
had established the Universal Friendship Club at her place
to attract people to the Faith. The club consisted of firesides
where topics like unity and brotherhood were discussed

along with social activities such as picnics, games, sports and
other outdoor activities. Most early Peruvian Bahä'is häd been
students of English and were confirmed through the love that
Eve instilled in those gatherings.

A successful dressmaker for Lima's upper class society,
Meche had decided to take English lessons so that she could
undertake a correspondence course to improve her dress
design expertise. She then approached a German, teacher
of English, who after considering Meche's work schedule too
complex for arranging lessons, referred her to Eve Nicklin.
Meche was warned, however, that Eve Nicklin had a "strange
religion". In Meche's words:

> When I met her [Eve Nicklin], she was forming it [the
> Universal Friendship Club] and her Local Assembly
> was elected two years earlier. I got invited to that club.
> She said: "Well, I hope to see you here on Wednesday,
> we have a club." Well, I was not a Bahá'í and I had
> difficulty understanding new ideas. I saw the pictures
> and just asked, "Who is the man on this table?" which
> was 'Abdu'1-Bahá. There was a young interpreter,
> Manuel Vera, who explained it to me ... Then I went
> on Wednesday and there was an American, Gwenne
> Sholtis, who was en route to Bolivia being a pioneer
> there, and then she played a game, where we were all
> sitting on the carpet on the floor. We were all young and
> the questions and answers were all in English. It was
> very simple and nice which I seemed to like. Eve then
> asked me to read from her worn out book Bahďďlláh
> and the New Era a passage about equal rights for men
> and women. I read it and she told me, "Ah, you read
> very well Meche. Do you not want to come on Saturday

to talk about this point?""W hat happens on Saturday?"
I said. [Eve replied]: "The youths meet and we all read
from that book. You w ill read and Manuel Vera w ill give
the explanations tha t I am going to give in English
because he is the translator." All this was in English.

"Perfect"! said.

I went and told a close friend w ho I known since
we were children. His name was Demetrio Molero and
he worked w ith me. I said, "Demetrio, you know, I have
been invited by a lady Eve Nicklin. She is nice and gives
classes on Saturday. I w ill read this paragraph from this
book and then we will comment, but you know, I am a
bit scared because I do not know what it is, whether it
is political because it [the book] speaks of rights of men
and women and I have also heard about a universal

> currency." And he told me:"But Meche, why do you get
> involved w ith those things? You do not know.""Well," I
> told him, "but we must also have new experiences in
our lives. And that's why I invite you because you are

> my friend. I will invite my brother Enrique and a few of
> his university friends and some other people. It would
> not be that they will throw tomatoes at me [laughing].

"Well," he said, "let's go together".

Saturday came and I had already read and prepared
> myself on that book. I went with my brother, my
> brother-in-law and some friends of my brother. When I
> finished reading the book I gave my opinion, because
> I was always concerned with achieving justice, social
> justice, but not through religion but by other means.
Then Eve Nicklin explained and gave me an account of

what the Bahá'í Faith is.

I was astonished when Demetrio raised his hand
> and said:"What do I have to do to join this movement?"
> "Well, you have to read such and such book" replied
> Eve. On Monday, when he came to my house I told
> him: "But Demetrio, what have you done? Belonging
> to this movement? If here it says that this movement
> is religion" "Yes Meche, [he replied] because I have
> always been a free thinker ... my mind is completely
> different".

So, for almost a year I was bothering the Bahä'is,
> sometimes mocking at them within myself because I
> thought, "These four people, what do they think? Jesus
> Christ is the Son of God ... and how can they say that
> Bahä'u'lläh is the return of Christ". And then I went
> through my internal strife, my spoken confessions
> with Father Fordin, who had been my spiritual guide
> since I took communion at the age of seven years.
> And I explained to him that they [the Bahä'is] forbid
> nothing to me. He, a very intelligent man, said: "We
> have to be careful because they may be the false
> prophets who will come ... But anyway, if they do not
> forbid you anything, keep investigating" And so, after
a year in December, I said "I want to belong to this

Faith".114

By that time the Lima Bahä'i community had no more than
thirty members. The following year Meche was elected to the
Local Spiritual Assembly and also chosen by the community to
represent Peru at the Second South American Bahä'i Congress
to be held in January 1948 in Santiago, Chile. Meche and Eve
embarked on a small ship that stopped at every port en route,
taking fifteen days to reach their destination. The only people

on the ship were the captain, his wife and a few women to
whom the Faith was delivered. They also taught the Faith at
each port along the way.

> Baha'i Congress in Chile, 1948. Eve is sitting at the
> right extreme — Meche is sitting third from the left

This congress which was followed by a summer school
had a great impression on Meche and on the other native
believers. There, these few early South American believers,
armed with a very basic knowledge of the Faith and scattered
through the vast subcontinent, realized that they were part
of a major brotherhood linking them, despite the tyranny of
distance. There were delegates from Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia,
Peru, Uruguay and Chile. Their inspiration and guidance came
from the beloved Guardian Shoghi Effendi who through per­
sonal correspondence from Haifa was lovingly guiding them
step by step. The delegates also realized that they were all
learning, asking simple questions, focusing on teaching

methods to expand their Faith. As a result, a public talk was
held and an article on the Faith appeared in El Mercurio.
The beloved Guardian also sent a special message for the
event.

Meche's participation in the Santiago Congress enhanced
her capabilities and enthusiasm to serve the Cause of God at
the local, national and international level. Being a successful
business women, she offered a rented flat where she used
to rent evening gowns, to serve as the Lima Bahá'í center for
many years. It is in this venue where CEBSA, the Bahá'íTeaching
Committee for South America, after transferring its seat from
Santiago to Lima, began an intensive publishing program pro­
ducing Bahá'ř literature in Spanish such as Boha'u'llah and the
New Era, with the assistance of an old mimeograph and the
local youth. Her house was also a place where both interna­
tional and national visitors were generously accommodated.

In 1951 Meche was elected to the first Regional National
Spiritual Assembly for ten South American countries (Peru,
Ecuador, Chile, Bolivia, Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay,
Colombia and Argentina). Such a body was later re-arranged
into two regional national assemblies each with five coun­
tries under their jurisdictions where Meche also served
with great devotion, frequently travelling overseas for insti­
tutional meetings and other events. She made innumer­
able teaching trips to the interior of the country and served
as homefront pioneer to help establish the Local Spiritual
Assemblies required by the goals of the Ten Year Crusade.
In 1961 the National Spiritual Assembly of Peru was formed
and two years later Meche had the privilege of being pres­
ent at the first election of the Universal House of Justice in

1963\. Some few years later, Meche was appointed a member
of the Auxiliary Board to the Hands of the Cause, continuing
her teaching trips to the interior of the country and encour­
aging the friends in summer schools and other events. It is
fair to say that to a certain extent Meche had inherited much
of Eve Nicklin's spiritual attributes of patience, understanding
and consecration.

The 1997 National Convention of Peru paid a beautiful
homage to Meche when she, for health reasons, was released
from her almost forty-year long services as Auxiliary Board
member. At the closing of the event, someone asked that all
those who served as Assistants to Meche should stand up. It
was emotionally overwhelming to see that almost all atten­
dants, including all attending Auxiliary Board and National
Spiritual Assembly members, instantaneously rose to their
feet. There were dozens of friends that during decades and

under various circumstances had served under her lov­
ing guidance and care, and now were paying tribute to her
work whose loving education was later affectionately known
as "Meche's School". At her death the Universal House of
Justice wrote to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís

of Peru:

> We are grieved to learn of the passing of the much
> loved, staunch maidservant of Bahá'u'lláh Mercedes
> Sánchez. Her many decades of selfless, consecrated
> service in the teaching and administrative spheres are
> exemplary. Present and future generations of Peruvian
> believers will warmly remember her kindness, her
> love, and her nurturing spirit. You are urged to hold
> memorial meetings in major centres of your country.

> Be assured of our ardent prayers in the Holy Shrines
> for the progress of her radiant soul in the worlds to
> come. Kindly extend our heartfelt condolences to her
> fam ily.115

The Becketts and Callao

David Beckett, a British subject, was a young man who
worked as an officer at the British Consulate in Lima. Juanita
Cordoba, a friend of the Baha'is had invited him to participate
in the meetings of the Universal Friendship Club. At the Club
meetings, David met Mary Angulo who eventually became
his wife. David was the son of a Protestant missionary and
was raised under a strong Biblical education. But David had

been attracted to the Faith through Eve's intervention and so
he embraced it in 1946. Their parents, living in England, were
surprised when he wrote them asking for their consent to
marry Mary, a permission that eventually was granted.

The wedding took place on October 31, 1946, being the
first Bahá'í marriage in Peru and also in South America. Eve
created a fictitious dialogue to illustrate certain moments of
the Bahá'í history of Peru. In the dialogue, Henrifer Morales
Macedo and Rosemary Beckett, two Bahá'í children from
the Lima community, talk together about the details of the
ceremony.

> Rosemary says: "The wedding took place in the Bahá'í
> Center which was the house of the resident pioneer
> (Eve Nicklin). The room facing the East was chosen to
> solemnize the marriage which had been decorated
> with beautiful flowers and the Greatest Name. Among
> the attendees were: Eve Nicklin, resident pioneer,
> Manuel Vera, vice-chair of the Assembly and Mario
> Rodriguez who read the Table of Marriage of'Abdu'l-
> Bahá. My mother had a precious memory in her hands,
> hair from Bahá'u'lláh's sacred head that had been
> placed in a frame in the form of book. The relics were a
> gift originally from Bahíyyih Khánum to Martha Root".

"And the guests?" Henrifer asked.

"There were Bahá'ís, their friends and relatives
> as well as David's fellow workers from the British
> Consulate. There were about sixty people altogether.
> I remember my father saying how interested was the
> Consul trying to read the Greatest Name. It seems that

> he had served in Persia and had met some Bahä'is in
> his work, but he did not know much of the Faith until
> attending the wedding"

"The marriage of your father and your mother, was
> the union of the old and the new world, isn't?" Henrifer
> commented.

"Yes, my mother is Peruvian and my father is
English"

I remember part of the letter that the Guardian
> sent to them through Rúhíyyih Khánum: "He [Shoghi
> Effendi] hopes that you, representing the old and the
> new world, will render many valuable services for the
> Cause."116

About that date, Eve writes to the Guardian enclosing a
photo of the new couple, and although the answer arrives
late due to the pressure of his work, the communication
brings more blessings again. The beloved Guardian wrote
to her;

> Assuring you of my loving and continued prayers for
> your success and for the extension of your meritorious,
> your historic and deeply appreciated activities.117-

It was in 1946 when the Lima friends decided to open
Callao, the main Peruvian city port as a goal. David Beckett's
father was the representative of the Biblical Society in Peru
and that branch had a small office in Callao. When Mr. Beckett
senior left the country for England he had rented the premises

to the Bahá'ís. Eve tells us that there were boxes of Bibles which
were covered and used for sitting with some cushions. The ini­
tial furniture was a table and a writing desk. The Bahá'í Center
of Callao began operating on October 3,1946, with a capacity
of thirty and seven people. By December of 1946 there were
five believers in Callao.

For the 1946 Gregorian New Year the Bahá'ís of Callao
had a youth celebration with fifty guests followed by a talk.
Eve tells that in January the Club of the Universal Friendship
in Callao was formed and that the president "is studying the
Faith". For the two first sessions of the Club there were sixteen
members. The work in Callao also continued enthusiastically
in 1947. Mr. DemetrioTaboada opened his home to the Faith
and at the celebration of the birth of the Báb there were about
sixty people.

Because the Bahá'í Center contract expired in Callao, with
much difficulty Eve and the friends found another place but
could only be used two nights each week, on Tuesdays and
Thursdays. English classes were delivered as well as conver­
sations about the Faith including education issues. The locale
became operative on July 7, 1947, on 169 Domingo Nieto
Street. The Boha'/News issue of May 1947 reports that:

> Eve Nicklin and the Assembly of Lima, Peru, are working
> against time in Callao. They have a foundation of 5
> members and have built up a large class of students.
> Eve reported that 100 attended their last public
> meeting. They are trying out the plan of visiting the
> various lodges, especially the workmen's lodges, and
> offering a speaker on any cultural topic which may be

> selected by the lodge. This topic is then presented from
> the Bahá'í point of view without being a direct Bahá'í
> talk. At the close, the members are invited to come to
> the Bahá'í Center to hear the real stuff.118

In October 1949 the Becketts move to Callao along with Eve
in order to hasten efforts to achieve the formation of the Local
Spiritual Assembly of Callao. They lived on 865 Grau Street. By
that time, Callao had already five believers and getting near to
the goal. According to the March 1951 Baha'i News: "A novel
means of attracting new contacts is being tried out in Callao,
goal city of Peru. A roof garden connected with the apart­
ments of Miss Eve Nicklin and Mr. and Mrs. David Beckett, has
been arranged as a shuffleboard court and a game of darts
also set up. Here friends are welcomed for a social hour each
Sunday afternoon. Bahá'í meetings are also held in this roof
garden."119

Several months earlier, Mr. Luis King offered his home to
work as a Bahá'í Center, on 459 Cockrane Street, which actu­
ally helped greatly in the consolidation of the community
along with the other Bahá'í Center that the Beckett couple
had opened in their home. Also, by July 1949, Bahá'í slides
began to be shown in tw o Callao cinemas. In November 1949
the friends began broadcasting Bahá'í programs at Radio
Victoria based on the "Celestial Song" by Howard Colby Ives,
as well as promoting the Bahá'í meetings in both centers. We
also know that the Regional Teaching Conference for Peru
was hosted in the Callao Bahá'í Center on September 7,1950
with Eve talking about the twin Covenants of Bahá'u'lláh and
'Abdu'1-Bahá.

The BaháT Community of Callao (Peru) in 1951

At Ridván in 1951 the Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of
Callao was finally formed being comprised of: Luis King, Eve
Nicklin, Etelvina Marquez, Rosendo Marquez, Esteban Ramos,
Mary Beckett, David Beckett, Alejandro Garro and Moraima
Casas. By that time, there were already eleven believers. Callao
became the second spiritual assembly of Peru — an event that
made the Guardian very happy. In a letter written on his behalf
dated October 31,1951, Shoghi Effendi's secretary stated:

> He [Shoghi Effendi] was delighted to hear the work in
> Peru is going ahead and that the Callao Assembly is so
> firm and fine.

You are certainly seeing the harvest begin to come
> in, many seeds of which you yourself sowed with such
> devoted care and sacrifice! Truly you and the other
> pioneers have been richly rewarded and blessed.120

Such success in such a short period of time was certainly
related to Eve's personal attributes which are the subject of
the next chapter. At that stage, we see Eve developing herself
as an effective pioneer, being asked to perform similar ser­
vices in other lands such as Punta Arenas en Chile.

PIONEERING VIRTUES

Notable among Eve's personal attributes was her ability to
relate to people. This was particularly evidenced in how the
early Peruvian Baha'i community was taken care of. As a loving
mother Eve showed by deeds how much she cared about her
spiritual children. It was obvious for her that building a com­
munity of believers required establishing as well as deepen­
ing bonds of friendship among its members. This was evident
in her work in Lima and in Punta Arenas, Chile, her next pio­
neering destination.

The Gift of Nurturing

Meche Sanchez recalled this loving facet of Eve's personality:

> She had a very special way of working. She demonstrated
> a great ability and patience. She had a very special way
> of attracting young people. First-of-all, as she lived in

La Colmena [Lima's downtown], the tram going to the
beach resorts of Callao and La Punta passed in front
of her house. Throughout the summer, she invited us
on Sundays to bring a lunch box and be at her home
at nine o'clock or ten. We used to go to Callao and our
preferred bathing spot was La Punta. She was a good
swimmer. Then, we used to play first, talk and then went
for a swim. At lunchtime she always chose a lonely place
for lunch. It is where she began with a book"Bahá'u'lláh
and the New Era" to give her first classes. Then we were
all to hear her reading, someone translated for us, and
she gave her views. In the afternoon we came back. The
tram made its last stop almost in front of the house. So
we [were tired and] wanted to go to our homes. And she
used to say: "Please let's go up for a moment and make
some tea ... after all this day at the beach you need to
have something hot." There were always some cookies
and we sat on the carpet, on the floor, and then she,
taking advantage of the time, gave another class.

That was in summer. In winter, we have the resort
town of Chosica 121 with sunshine all year long and
we went by train. That was a very beautiful thing. The
train was four blocks away ... So we rose early because
the train was leaving at eight o'clock in the morning
and returned at four in the afternoon. Then with our
lunch boxes we went out with Eve. Those excursions
in that train to Chosica were truly a wonderful trip for
us. When we arrived we looked for a place on the river
where we could bathe and at the same time she was
looking for places with trees and grass. There we sat,
talked, and then studied, and then we bathed followed
by lunch. There was so much joy. She was allowing us

to get to know each other better, to be like brothers
and sisters, feeling like a real family.

A 1945 picnic to Chosica (Lima, Peru) — Eve is number 7

Upon our return from Chosica we followed the
> same pattern [as Callao's] "We have to go up and have
> tea [Eve used to say]." Now it was winter."Have some tea
> and a little rest and then go home." It was usually half
> past four p.m. We went up to her apartment, prepared
> tea, and then we sat on the carpet while Eve began
> with another reading and another class. This was how
> she really began to strengthen this Assembly in Lima.

She was the first teacher in visual aids. As she could
> not speak Spanish well, she would cut out pictures
> and stick them on cartons. She always had colour

magazines She used to teach the principles: equal
rights for men and women, always put women on one
side, the man on the other side, for a balance... She did
wonderful things [with those pictures]. To explain, for
example, that there should not be class differences, she
put a Chinese, one black, one white, in brief, different
races, making them a circle and always spoke of that
unity that was supposed to have. She did all with
pictures. She had huge albums about all our principles
to be able to explain. That was how she started
working...

One of the most beautiful things that our pioneer
[Eve] had was that she never was in a hurry. She was a
person who did not want to have links with her country
people. We, I, at least always used to tell her: "Eve, why
do you not invite some American friends because there
is a beautiful colony here." She said: "No, my friends and
my children are you Peruvians." There was never any
rush for lunch, for lunch or for food. If she saw that we
were entertaining, studying any book or helping them
with their visual aids, she was happy. I have the feeling
that she wanted us to feel at home. I remember that
in those early years (about 1947, 1948) a Bahá'í said
at her apartment: "Eve, what if I paint it?" "Okay kids,
get the colour you want, this is your home," [she said].
And we painted it with Demetrio Molero, the living
room was beautiful as well as her bedroom, kitchen
and the bathroom. Eve made us feel that this was our
house.122

The Second BaháT Congress in Chile

Meche continues her narrative:

> I remember that one day there was the election of
> delegates to the Second [Bahá'í] Congress in Chile
> in January 1948 and I was elected delegate [and] to
> accompany Eve. It was when we were approaching
> Valparaiso [Chile's main port] when I realized my
> responsibility. And I said to Eve: "But if I do not know
> anything ... I do not know anything ...""No," she said,
> "you Meche will present very well." It was sunrise and I
> was on deck, watching when I heard someone calling:
> "Mercedes Sanchez, Eve Nicklin." He was a Chilean who
> came to welcome us. He, Esteban Canales, climbed

> the stairs quickly and hugged us. I then realized that
> this is the universal family that Eve Nicklin had been
> talking to us about. Then I felt protected and told
> him: "Esteban I do not know anything.""Do not worry
> Meche, [he said] we are all on the same pathway." In
> Valparaiso I was taken to Rosita Caro's home ... There
> we stayed one night to rest.

I would like to tell a story because it shows Eve's
> ability. That was Saturday. On Sunday I heard church
> bells and I stood up and got dressed. Eve also got
> dressed and came out behind me. She said, "Meche,
> you do not know where you are going". I said: "But I
> hear the bells over there Eve Nicklin ... Over there must
> be a church, a temple nearby." And it happened that
> there was temple very close. And I went in as I was still
> in need to need to hear mass. Eve Nicklin also came in
> into the temple, I kneeled down, she did the same until
> I le ft... She was a pioneer with great tact, a quality that
> lacks in many people.

And then we took a train with Esteban Canales to
> Santiago. This Second Congress was in a very beautiful
> house. And then I realized that we were all just learning.
> We all started to ask infantile questions which now
> seem to me out of place ..."123

This congress in January 1948 proved to be very inspiring
because the few scattered Bahá'ís in the ten South American
countries were aware of each other's teaching developments
and felt part of a big brotherhood.

Pioneering Virtues

Margot Worley, the delegate from Brazil, who had met Eve
on her short 1937 pioneering to that country recalled: "She
wrote a little comedy on how to form an assembly and how
elections should be conducted as well as the meetings of
Assembly, which was very funny, and we all learned, because
at that time, few of us knew for sure how to form an assembly
and other procedures; we were all making history and every­
thing was taken very seriously."124

During this congress the participants received the call
from the beloved Guardian for a pioneer to move to consoli­
date the Spiritual Assembly of Punta Arenas at the southern
tip of Chile. Artemus Lamb, the resident pioneer had to leave
the post.The attendees decided on Eve since she"was the only
person available by then." According to Eve, "when I returned
from Santiago and gave the news [to the Bahá'ís of Lima] they
all protested. They argued a number of reasons... I myself was
afraid of leaving them."125

Although she entertained the idea of going to Punta
Arenas, her fears were too many and therefore she writes in
consultation to the Guardian. On January 30, 1948, Shoghi
Effendi, through his secretary, wrote:

> He heartily approves of your going to Punta Areas to
> strengthen the work there, as he considers it a very
> important outpost of the Faith and one that must be

She decided to leave her apartment in the hands of two
believers but the community complained arguing that there
was already a Spiritual Assembly and that they would be
responsible for keeping it until her return. Eve finally acceded
to the request and soon embarked on the "San Sebastian" on
February 28, 1948. A group of friends farewelled her at the
port of Callao.

Punta Arenas

Punta Arenas (Sandy Point, in Spanish) was visited first by a
Bahä'i in the person of Marcia Steward 127, the earliest pio­
neer to Chile. Marcia had recommended that a man should
settle in that town which was considered the southernmost
city of the world. Punta Arenas is located 3000 km from the
capital Santiago at the extreme south of the continent having
an annual average temperature of 6.5°C. It was a pioneering
place very close to the Guardian's heart.

Artemus Lamb, another American believer, had heard
Shoghi Effendi's pioneering call to Punta Arenas at an Inter-
American Convention and in due course moved there arriv­
ing in October 1944. Artemus described his destination with
these words:

> Punta Arenas was also quite cosmopolitan, albeit still
> a bit primitive. Some Spanish families, a good number

> of British, a colony of Yugoslavs who were descendants
> of the survivors of a Yugoslav ship-wreck, an American
> Vice-Consul and a few other diplomats, temporarily a
> geophysical team from the U.S.A. in search of oil, and
> native Chileans. Punta Arenas, located on the Straits
> of Magellan, across from Tierra del Fuego, had been a
> former Chilean penal colony.128

It was eventually decided that Marcia should return to
Santiago and that a young new believer would come to assist
Artemus. Soon after, in April 1945, thefirst local spiritual assem­
bly was formed, an event that brought much happiness to the
Guardian. Artemus, however, had to re-allocate to Santiago in
June 1947 to help with the establishment of CEPSA, the newly
created Bahá'í International Teaching Committee for South
America.

Eve stayed in Punta Arenas from March 1948 to May 1949.

Although the Spiritual Assembly had been formed in 1945
there was a need for further expansion and consolidation. Eve
eventually managed to consolidate the Spiritual Assembly in
that remote place so valued by Shoghi Effendi. However, her
hard work was hampered by the terrible winter, snow, heavy
rains, and her rheumatism — she was a woman in fifties.
Eve felt that in Lima there were people but no propaganda,
but in Punta Arenas there was propaganda but no people.
Nevertheless her pioneering work was intensive, giving her­
self as much she could, delivering broadly the Faith to the
inhabitants of the Land of Fire. She writes to the Guardian and

receives the following advice:

Dear Bahá'í Sister,

Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated Nov. 1st,
has been received, and he has instructed me to answer
you on his behalf.

He fully realizes the difficulties involved in
maintaining such an assembly as that of Punta Arenas.
But he urges the friends, and you, not to lose heart, but
rather to try new means of contacting a different range
of people. Perhaps, through becoming active in some
social or other type of clubs, or assistance in charitable
works, or promotion of U.N.O. Support in ways such as
these — you and the believers may succeed in making
new contacts which would not ordinarily respond to
public meetings, advertisements or broadcasts.

He will pray for your success and the protection
of your assembly in the Holy Shrines, and he
greatly appreciates your determined and devoted
labours.

With Bahá'í love,

Dear and valued co-worker:

I am so pleased to learn of the progress of your
work in so important and distant a field, am profoundly
grateful for your steadfast and noble endeavours.
Persevere in your glorious task and rest assured that
the Beloved will guide and sustain you in your labours,

> and will aid you to render still more notable services to
> His Faith and institutions.

Your true and grateful brother,

Eve reported some of her Punta Arenas experiences as
follows:

> There is not lack of charm in the landscape of Patagonia,
> but there are also large territories which for geographical
> and climatic reasons must be reckoned among the most
> desolate on earth. There are the ice-bound, glacier-
> covered portions of the High Cordilleras, and in the
> western part of the Strait of Magallanes, glaciers which
> reach all the way down into the sea and form icebergs.
> Deep esteros, or fjords, cut through the mountains into
> the sea— fjords that are said to resemble those of Norway.
> This is Patagonia, or the "Big Foot", a fantastic land, where
> the Strait of Magallanes and the Beagle Channel make
> sea lanes for travel and commerce among the nations of
> the world. Patagonia, which has long held a fascination
> for explorers, is now becoming a great tourist attraction.

It is in this far, southern country, in the city of Punta
> Arenas, Chile, that I met Mary. Mary is a tourist. In her
> early years, she taught philosophy in a State University,
> travelled in may lands, and even won fame for herself
> as a mountain climber. But this is her first trip to
> Patagonia, and here in this southernmost outpost of
> the Bahá'í Faith she has heard the name Bahá'u'lláh for
> the first time. She is destined to stay in Magallanes for

many weeks because the boat that is going to the fjords
is under repair. The other day she said to me, "I can't
understand this delay, but,"she added philosophically,
"there must be some good reason." I said, but not
aloud, "Yes, Mary, there is a good reason. This delay will
give you an opportunity to hear the most important
Message of all times the news that the Promised One
of all ages has now come! Oh, I know that you have
told me, by implication, that my religion cannot be as
important as I think it is, for otherwise you, with your
wide experience and learning, would surely have heard
of it. But, I pray, that you will grasp its importance when
you read through the literature that I have chosen for
you. I shall not force these teachings on you, Mary, but
1shall be praying that you will investigate them with a
humble heart. You are a woman with a keen mind, and
fine innate qualities. God can, if you will let Him, bless
your closing years with the most wonderful career of
your life — that of becoming a humble teacher of great
Truths, and a wayfarer in the Path of God."130

Many times, it so happens that the person who
is not yet ready to give a listening ear to the Bahá'í
teachings, is the means of acquainting another, who
has long wanted to hear it, that there is a worldwide,
unified faith at work today, building a civilization
founded upon spiritual and universal principles.

Last Sunday, Mary invited me to go to the house
of a European family to whom she had given a letter
of introduction. The young mother in the family is an
artist. She has thought up the interesting occupation
of designing and having Magallanicos made into
saleable articles, ski suits, sweaters, mittens, slippers
and caps. She uses the wool from sheep raised on
the Patagonian pampas; penguin and seal skins from
the coast and nearby islands; feathers supplied by the
ostriches; white crystals picked up in the mountains
and which make pendants and pins. My interest in
her work resulted in her acceptance of an invitation
to visit the Bahá'í Center to see materials from Bolivia,
Peru and Ecuador that are used there as decorations.
Almost upon entering the room, my new friend asked
me to explain to her the significance of the sign on the
door "Centro Bahá'í". Forgotten for the moment were

ponchos, mantos, llamas and rugs, in the excitement
of hearing for the first time the Message of Bahá'u'lláh.

> She commented: "These are my ideals. One reason for
> my learning many languages, was in order to know my
fellow men better." From the Bahá'í bookshelf I took

> three books, Spanish, English and French translations,
> of Bahá'u'lláh's teachings."Someone has borrowed the
> German copy, I remarked; "In which language do you
> wish to read His Message?"TII choose the French book,

> she said, "I'm teaching French," When we parted, we
> planned to have tea together and more talks. All day
> long, my heart said, "Another opportunity to give the
> Glad Tidings, and thanks be to God, to hearing ears"131

But Eve's heart was, in truth, in her "adopted country" and
her "spiritual sons," her "babies" Eventually, the Bahä'iTeaching
Committee for South America (CEBSA) chose Mr. Tony Fillon
132 to substitute Eve whose health had become an issue due
to the rough environment.133 She writes to Shoghi Effendi a
letter on May 2, 1949, but the response arrives after October
1949\. Eve arrived in Lima on May 26,1949. The Guardian wrote
to her in his response:

> Your invaluable services, rendered with such exemplary
> devotion and in such distant fields, evoke my deepfelt
> admiration. I will continue to pray for your success from
> the depths of my heart. Persevere in your meritorious
> and indeed historic labours, and rest assured that
> the Beloved is well pleased with the standard of your
> achievements in the service of His Faith.134

In an interview with Mario Leon, Eve reveals her feelings
about that time.

EN: I kept a close collaboration with them [Lima Bahá'ís].

> I kept abreast of everything that happened. When
> describing some of their problems I tried to guide them
> on what I would do. Of course, whatever was beyond
> my ability was referred to the beloved Guardian.

ML: And didn't they ask you to return to Peru?

EN: Of course. Some friends told me that the problems

were getting worse and were in need of my return.

ML: And, when did you return?

EN: Well, once their problems became worse or they

> thought they were.They decided to cable the Guardian
> for my return. They never mentioned that they had
> cabled.

ML: And how did you find that they had cabled the

Guardian?

EN: [Laughters] I do not exactly remember. But someone

> asked me what the Guardian had told me. To which
> I replied that the goal in Punta Arenas had been
> achieved, then the Guardian thought that was time for
> my return. But, they insisted that the Guardian had said
> something regarding their request.

EN: What did you ask?, I asked them.

Your return! [They replied]

And did you get an answer?, I asked them again.

Sure! [They responded]

Where is it? Can I see the answer?

Ah, the answer is that you're here!135

SIGNS OF MATURITY

The temporary absence of the "Spiritual Mother" did help the
community very well, as the Guardian had promised, with
many signs of reaching maturity being evident.

"Well, everyone to walk," said Demetrio Molero, the trea­
surer of the Assembly seriously. They could no longer con­
tinue with the Eve's policy of putting a little bowl to receive
small contributions to the Fund. This time was different as
they had to pay 140 soles in arrears plus tips to the elevator
man. Demetrio told everyone that in future contributions will
not be voluntary. The Assembly met and decided to consult
each member of the community who should give according
to their income and set a quota. Demetrio was in charge of
going to everybody's workplace each month in order to carry
out the collection. It should be clarified at this point that in the

Bahá'í Faith all contributions are strictly voluntary and without
any form of compulsion, however, the friends were not well
aware of this principle. Every week there was a committee of

two people for cleaning and for the celebrations. Demetrio
was in charge of keeping the center open every Saturday for
meetings. Whatever the number of visitors was, the Bahá'í
center remained open. Suddenly the community saw them­
selves more responsible and active while the Assembly was
meeting more regularly. There were eight new Bahá'ís as well
as a wedding and many public teaching events.

Eve and the South American Teaching Committee

It was in February 1949 when Demetrio Molero traveled as
a delegate for Peru to the third Bahä'i Congress in Sao Paulo,
Brazil. He traveled to La Paz and from there he flew to Sao
Paulo. At the congress he was asked whether Lima could host
the next event. Demetrio responded that they were not pre­
pared but then he suddenly received a letter from Mercedes
Sanchez. The letter announced that she was planning to buy
a house for the next congress. Consequently, Lima was cho­
sen as the venue for the next congress in May 1950. The news
that Lima would be the headquarters of the Fourth Congress
caused a rush job. This coincided with the decision of transfer­
ring CEBSA, the Bahá'í Teaching Committee for the ten South
American countries from Santiago (Chile) to Lima (Peru). Eve
was appointed as one of its members. According to Meche
Sanchez,

> ... [I have] many beautiful experiences and memories
> of this [CEBSA] work that began in Lima. A very old
> mimeograph was used where we wrote chapters
> of Baha'u'llah and the New Era. We, the youth, after
> finishing our day jobs used to go to Ocoňa Street.

Every day we all went there and did the typewriting,

Signs of Maturity

> worked with the old mimeograph, some were stapling,
> and so we produced a book that we still keep. All the
> friends began, accompanied by Eve Nicklin, to make
> this labour of unity and little by little we learned more
> about the Bahá'í Faith.136

According to David Beckett, one of the most enthusiastic:
"We were going united around the table singing, each putting
a sheet down and Eve was with us ..."Even friends of the Baháís
joined that happy band. David Beckett said: "I found in her

(Eve) a kind of mother. I am convinced that her mission was to
come here to do the job she did."137Very often they worked till
very late at night.

Eve was absent from the country during November and
December 1949 and January 1950, when she traveled to
the Teaching Regional Conference for Peru and Bolivia held
in La Paz at a breathless altitude of 13,313 feet above sea
level. At this event Eve begins to look seriously into teaching
indigenous people in compliance with the words of 'Abdu'l-
Bahá. In the Tablets of the Divine Plan, the Master had
envisioned a glorious future for these native peoples within
the Faith:

> Attach great importance to the indigenous population
> of America. For these souls may be likened unto the
> ancient inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula, who,
> prior to the Mission of Muhammad, were like unto
> savages. When the light of Muhammad shone forth
> in their midst, however, they became so radiant as
> to illumine the world. Likewise, these Indians, should
> they be educated and guided, there can be no doubt
> that they will become so illumined as to enlighten the
whole w orld.138

Regional Bahá'í Congress in November
1949, La Paz, Bolivia — Eve is at the front

In Bolivia, a country largely populated by indigenous
people, Eve began considering the idea of living in Cusco,
Peru, the cradle of the Inca Empire and a region in the Andes
predominantly populated by Quechua people. From La Paz,
she wrote to Shoghi Effendi who in turn reminded her of the
noble services of Leonora Holesapple Armstrong as well as his
happiness in hearing about the spiritual progress of the Latin
Americans already carrying on their shoulders the responsi­
bilities of the Cause of Bahá'u'lláh.

The Fourth South American Congress

The big day came with the hosting of the fourth and last
South American Congress. The reception was held at the Hotel
Crillon and the meetings at the home of the Sanchez family.
There was an interview on Radio America as well as a pub­
lic lecture at the Asociacion Guadalupana. In this Congress,

Signs of Maturity

Lima was appointed as the seat of the First South American
Convention to be held the next year 1951 for the historic elec­
tion of the National Assembly for ten countries (Argentina,
Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru,
Uruguay, and Venezuela). Dorothy Baker came to represent
the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United
States and Canada. In response to the delegates' warm mes­
sage, Shoghi Effendi cabled on May 7,1950:

> Deeply     touched    message     welcome     pledge
> supplicating fervently abundant blessings realization
> hopes appreciate support services Dorothy [Baker]
urge redouble efforts deepest love Shoghi.139

• v:v

A summary from Eve Nicklin's notes sheds light on the
highlights of the event:

> Well organized committees of preparation facilitated
> the Baha'i Congress at Lima, Peru to begin the
> session with dignity and order; and with the aid of a
> very efficient Chairman this dignity and order were
> maintained throughout every session.

The keynote of the Congress was a desire to deepen
> in the fundamental knowledge of our God-given
> institutions and in the Spirit of our Faith. The opening
> chord was struck when the delegates demonstrated
> their fervent desire to have a deeper understanding of
> the Covenant around which revolves all Bahá'í life. A
> plea for more material was made in order that study
> classes may be formed for deepening purposes.

Again the keynote was manifest in the wish to
amplify their knowledge of the history of our Cause
and to know how to familiarize the friends with
historical materials. It was at this session that C.E.B.S.A.
presented the booklet, Bocetos Historicos de la Fe
Bahá'í, a collection of stories translated into Spanish
from the English. It represented the cooperative effort
of the friends in each of the South American countries.

And yet again the keynote was heard in the hour
dedicated to methods of maturing in the spiritual life,
through obedience to the laws of Bahá'u'lláh.

A high note of the Congress was the presence of Mrs.

Dorothy Baker a representative of the National Spiritual
Assembly of the United States. 140 The eagerness
on the part of the delegates to give as much time as
possible in order to gain first hand knowledge of the
working of a National Bahá'í Assembly which has been
functioning for many years, demonstrated anew the
earnest desire of the friends of Latin America to make
ready for the time when they will have their National
Spiritual Assemblies. The precise as well as the
inspirational way in which this material was presented
by the representative caused the delegates to remark
over and over, "We see it all so much clearer now." It
was perhaps this thirst for more profound knowledge
of our spiritual institutions that helped the congress
members to eliminate the lesser things that often
waste precious time at congresses, and to go straight
to the heart of the more important issues.

Signs of Maturity

The emphasis that the delegates placed on action,
> and not simply words, showed a spiritual maturity
> that was indeed heartening. They seemed eager to go
> back to their countries to reestablish lost assemblies,
> make groups into assemblies, and consolidate present
> assemblies. Latin American pioneers arose to go into
> fields where help is sorely needed.

After the Congress Eve flew to the United States as she was
formally invited to attend the commemoration of the Báb's

martyrdom. She stayed overseas during June, July and August
1950\. Eve went back home after nine years to see friends and
family. According to the October 1950 Baha'i News Eve "spent a
summer visiting and lecturing in her homeland". Meche relates:

> Our whole community supported her. She needed
> that trip that she had really earned. In Lima we
> commemorated that event with two major meetings
> ... One at noon, the martyrdom time, in the small place
> we had on Ocoňa Street,142and another, in the evening,
> with more than a hundred people at the Sanchez
> Family home. Upon returning from the United States,
> Eve brought us a little present, she said, for her children.
> And Eve said that she had already heard that the
> commemoration of the Centenary of the Martyrdom
> of the Báb had been a success:"! congratulate you, and
> you are now ready to continue by yourself."143

The First South American National Spiritual Assembly

We also know that Eve ran Study Institutes in Lima and La
Paz, Bolivia, in the second and last week of September 1950,
respectively. Ridván 1951 was fast approaching and with it the
election of the first South American Convention for ten coun­
tries. This was a historical milestone as the administration of
the Faith was transferred from the National Spiritual Assembly
of the Bahá'í of United States to an equivalent board repre­
senting ten South American national communities. Shoghi
Effendi had written:

> To the eager, the warm-hearted, the spiritually minded
> and staunch members of these Latin American
> Bahá'í communities who, among the followers of
> Bahá'u'lláh, already constitute the most considerable
> body of recruits from the ranks of the most deeply
> entrenched and powerful Church of Christendom;
> whose motherlands have been chosen as the scene
> of the earliest victories won by the prosecutors of
> 'Abdu'1-Bahá's Divine Plan; launched on their crusade
> for the spiritual conquest of the whole planet; the
> establishment of whose projected national spiritual
> assemblies must constitute a notable landmark in the
> second epoch of the Formative Age 144 of the Bahá'í
> Dispensation; whose leading spiritual assemblies
> are now establishing direct contact with the World
> Centre of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh in the Holy Land;
> the photographs of whose elected representatives, at
their chief, will soon adorn the walls of His Mansion at

Bahji; a few of whose members have already arisen to
> carry back the torch of divine guidance entrusted to
> their care to the peoples and races from which they

> have sprung — to this privileged, this youngest, this
> dynamic and highly promising member of the organic
> Bahá'í World Community, I feel moved, before I dismiss
> this aspect of my theme, to direct this general appeal
> to rise to the heights of the glorious opportunity which
> destiny is unfolding before its members. Theirs is the
> opportunity, if they but seize it, to adorn the opening
> pages of the annals of the second Bahá'í century with
> a tale of deeds approaching in valor those with which
> their Persian brethren have illuminated the opening
> years of the first, and comparable with the exploits
> more recently achieved by their North American
> fellow-believers and which have shed such luster on
> the closing decade of that same century.145

With such inspiring terms the Guardian showed the believ­
ers and communities what we might call the spiritual place
of Latin America in the Cause of BaháVIláh. The election of
the National Spiritual Assembly took place on April 21,1951,
resulting in Eve Nicklin's membership. Paul Haney, 146 repre­
senting the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the
United States, brought as a gift from the Guardian consisting
of Bahá'u'lláh's sacred hair to be stored in the archives of the
new National Assembly. There was also a radio program and a
public lecture at Hotel Bolivar.

The reception for the delegates took place at Hotel Crillon
and the whole Convention was held at Leura Hotel in Miraflores
(222 Grimaldo del Solar Street). In Eve's words:

> The hotel where the event took place was right on
> the same street where I had lived in the beginning.

Naturally, my thoughts went back to those days of

> struggle against the language, climate, loneliness,
> trying to gain contacts for the Faith and all the things
> a pioneer has to face in the pioneering field. But how
> different was that day! All those experiences could be
> counted as pure joy. I shared some of these experiences
> with Edna True and Paul Haney, those two beloved
> representatives who were sent by the Assembly of the
> United States of North America.147

The delegates also studied the message from the Guardian
to the two Latin American Conventions. 148 Shoghi Effendi
cabled the delegates in response to their cable:

> PROFOUNDLY APPRECIATE SENTIMENTS ASSEMBLED
> DELEGATES STOP PRAYING UNPRECENDENTED
> BLESSINGS FULFILLMENT OBJECTIVES149

To the new National Spiritual Assembly, the Guardian
cabled the following day:

> SUPPLICATING DIVINE BLESSINGS GUIDANCE GREAT
> VICTORIES   NEWLY ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES
> DEEPEST LOVE 150

A new stage in the development of the Bahá'í Faith in
South America had started. The message from the Guardian
itself bears witness to such a momentous event:

> Hail [with] joyous heart convocation[of] first twin
> historic Conventions [of] followers [of] Faith [of]
> Bahá'u'lláh [in] Central America, Mexico, [the] Antilles
> [and] South America, assembled [to] elect twin

SERVICES THROUGHOUT SOUTH

AMERICA

After the Convention, Eve remained in Peru in order to
strengthen Callao, her "assembly-baby", which was formed in
Ridvan 1951, as well as to assist CEBSA, the South American
teaching committee, and the work of the newly formed
National Spiritual Assembly. It was determined that its head­
quarters would be in Lima. Successive South American conven­
tions to which Eve had to attend were held in Argentina (1952),
Peru (1953), Chile (1954), Bolivia (1955) and Uruguay (1956).

The circle of her responsibilities stretched to include not
only attending regular institutional meetings in different
South American capital cities but indeed a lot of traveling
supporting the nascent local communities spread throughout
the vast subcontinent. Distance was a tyranny. Within the first
national assembly three members were on the Eastern coast,
three on the Western coast, one member on the top North,

one on the Southernmost city, and the other one in the very
heart of South America, totaling 11,000 miles of traveling for
a single meeting.

In 1957 the South American National Assembly was sepa­
rated into two new assemblies, one for the north with Lima as
headquarters, and the other for the south with Buenos Aires as
the center. Eve remained in the membership of the northern
national assembly. As a member of those nascent institutions,
she had also to attend summer schools and other regional
events in various South American locations as well as visiting
Bahá'í communities en-route to Assembly meetings.

End of the Second Seven Year Plan (1946-1953)

Going backto 1952, Eve traveled to the Second South American
Convention in Ezeiza, Buenos Aires. After the Convention she
stays on to participate in an international summer school. It
was then when, at the request of the National Assembly, Eve
went to settle in Montevideo. Uruguay was one of the weakest
countries in the Faith at that time.

Services Throughout South America

Margot Malkin talks about their teaching work together in
Montevideo:

> I enjoyed Eve a lo t... When we arrived at the beginning,
> we rented a long and beautiful space from a British
> couple where we could live and try to invite friends
> to visit us occasionally. I immediately found a job as
> a secretary at a travel agency ... She never had much,
> and always, we pioneers were trying to supplement
> our income with English classes.

Eventually, Eve and I rented a small furnished

Ina letter written on June 10,1952, Shoghi Effendi through
his secretary addresses both Eve and Margot:

Dear Bahá'í Friends:

Your letter of May 22nd has been received, and the
> beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on
> his behalf.

He is pleased to see that you are going to serve the
> Faith in Montevideo, as he considered it an important
> Center of South America, and he assures you that he
> will pray for the success of your labours during the
> coming year.

Please give his loving greetings to all the believers
there.

With Bahá'í love,

May the Almighty bless, guide and sustain you, and
> enable you to promote, at all times, the vital interests
> of His Faith,

Your true brother,

In July 1952 Eve traveled to Lima for the meeting of the
National Assembly. On her way she visited Chile, Argentina
and Paraguay, always deepening and encouraging believers

Services Throughout South America

in those countries. In fact, all those National Assembly meet­
ings across South America were accompanied by teaching
trips and visits to Bahá'í groups.

Eve and Meche traveled together in April 1953 to the
United States for the opening of the Bahá'í Holy Year which
commemorated the centenary of the beginning of Bahá'u'lláh's
mission. That was an occasion for the dedication of the House
of Worship in Chicago as well as the launching of the Ten Year
Crusade. Shoghi Effendi, through his secretary, had written to
Eve on March 1953:

> Your labours have been of such great service to the
> Faith in Latin America, that he hopes you will continue,
> at least for part of the coming Ten Year Crusade, to
> work in that area.154

With the launching of the Ten Year Crusade Eve Nicklin's
services became more internationalized. This was in response
to the Guardian's summons to engage the Baha'i world in a
major spiritual enterprise to reach all parts of the globe before
the election of the Universal House of Justice in 1963. His mes­
sage to the Bahá'í world in May 1953 reads:

> The hour is ripe to disencumber themselves of worldly
> vanities, to mount the steed of steadfastness, unfurl
> the banner of renunciation, don the armor of utter
> consecration to God's Cause, gird themselves with the
> girdle of a chaste and holý life, unsheathe the sword of
> Bahá'u'lláh's utterance, buckle on the shield of His love,
> carry as sole provision implicit trust in His promise, flee
> their homelands, and scatter far and wide to capture
> the unsurrendered territories of the entire planet.155

Upon her return from the United States and in response
to the goals of the Ten Year Crusade Eve settled in Asuncion,
Paraguay. She also accompanied Hand of the Cause Mr.
Valiyďlláh Varqá on his teaching tour to Panama, Quito,
Guayaquil, Lima, Santiago and Montevideo, from where he
continued on unaccompanied to Brazil.

The Ten Year Crusade (1953-1963)

During theTen Year Crusade launched by the beloved Guardian,
where the Faith had to reach all the corners of the globe, Eve
successively settled in Asuncion (Paraguay), Arequipa (Peru),
Encarnacion (Paraguay) and Cusco (Peru). Her mission was
about forming and strengthening new local spiritual assem­
blies as well as reaching indigenous populations for the Faith.
This period of her life was crowned with her well-deserved pil­
grimage to the Holy Shrines at the Holy Land in 1963.

Asuncion (Paraguay)

Due to its central geographical location in South America,
Paraguay is known as the "Heart of America". Its capital,
Asuncion, is called the "Mother of All Cities" for being one of
the earliest Spanish settlements in the New World, having
been founded in 1537, as well as for its strategic location for
the whole region.

Eve relates about her teaching work in Paraguay:

> I was in Paraguay when Ellen Sims accompanied by
> her ten-year old daughter [Terry Vojdani] arrived

Services Throughout South America

> in Asuncion. Later Alice Bacon arrived. With this
> reinforcement the Local Assembly restarted its
> operation. It was time to buy a National Center in
> Paraguay. After an arduous search, we found a colonial
> house that would serve as a kind of reestablishment
> of the Faith in the hearts of the native believers ... But
> I was not intended to live in that house for long. It was
> Ellen and Alice who made the Bahä'i Center a place of
> hospitality for all those entering i t ...156

Terry Vojdani, Ellen Sims'daughter, wrote her recollections
of living with Eve in Paraguay:

> My mother [Ellen Sims] and I arrived in Paraguay in
> August 1954. Eve and my mother had been writing to
> each other for several weeks before we left (our trip
> was arranged quite quickly, as I remember it) and Eve
> told my mother that it was not really cold in Paraguay.
> People used to joke, saying that there were only two
> stations [the words for "stations" and "seasons" are the
> same in Spanish): summer and the train station! When
> we arrived, freezing, Eve was waiting for us at the air­
> port in a fur coat! Then Eve said to my mother: "Ellen,
> if you want to be a good pioneer, forget that you are
> American" (which my mother did). Eve always had
> her "can openers". These were albums that she made
> using pictures cut out of magazines and quotes from
> the Faith. She used them to talk with the people and
> teach the Faith. When we had to form another Local
> Assembly in Paraguay in order to be able to elect its
first National Assembly - around 1958-59 - Eve and two

> other pioneers moved to the city (which at that time
> wasjustatown) of Encarnacion with a family of Persian

> pioneers who had just arrived in order to form the LSA.
> Many times, when letters came from the Holy Land or
> other places that were very important and urgent and
> they were unable to get a quorum of Asuncion's LSA
> together, Mom and Eve would visit the assembly mem­
> bers one by one, say prayers, read the letter together
> and the members gave them their opinions. The last
> house they visited was that of the Assembly's secretary
> so that he would write the letter. It obviously wasn't
> the best thing to do, but at times they had to in order
> to send the answer on time. Eve, Alice Bacon (another
> American pioneer who lived in Paraguay for several
> years) and my mother bought what is still Paraguay's
> first National Bahá'í Center.157

In Paraguay Eve began teaching the Faith to indigenous
people. Eve was instrumental in the publication of a booklet
in Guarani language in 1954. On March 14,1954, the Guardian
through his secretary wrote to her on that regard:

Dear Bahá'í Sister:

Your letter of February 15th has been received by
> the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to
> answer on his behalf.

The Guardian was indeed happy to see the booklet
> gotten out by the Bahá'í National Committee for
> Indian Work in South America, printed in the Guarani
> language. This is a most meritorious service, and of
> great importance in the teaching of these people. He
> is hopeful that this booklet will become the means of

> introducing the Faith to many receptive souls among
> the Indians.

The Guardian deeply appreciates the services of
your Committee, and send you his loving greetings.

With Bahá'í love,

May the Beloved bless, guide and sustain you, and
> enable you to promote at all times, the vital interests
> of His Faith.

Your true brother,

Eve recounted her sentiments about teaching the natives:

> I remember it was in the 1954 Convention, in La Paz, Bolivia,
> when for the first time emphasis was on the conversion of
> indigenous peoples. Since my childhood I had an interest
> in this race, maybe that was why I was asked to prepare
> a special report on the indigenous peoples of South
> America with photographs and paintings in order to
> stimulate interest in the appeal for pioneers which would
> be made in the Convention. Three of us volunteered. The
National Assembly decided that I should go to Arequipa,

Peru. I was hoping to find someone to speak Quechua
> to act as a translator in the surrounding villages. The
Guardian had suggested that it would be the first step to

bring the message to indigenous peoples.159

Arequipa (Peru)

Arequipa, in Aymara language stands for"ari"and "quipa", the
equivalent to "peak" and "lie behind" respectively. This is so
because Arequipa stands at the majestic feet of the Misti, a
volcano that last erupted in the 14th century. Arequipa is the
second largest Peruvian city also known as the "White City"
due to the pearly volcanic rock used by the local constructors.
This beautiful city, with its unique colonial architecture, is sur­
rounded by scenic farmlands which takes its people to popu­
lar weekend picnics. Arequipa is also the main gateway to the
southern Andes having a significant indigenous population,
both Aymara and Quechua, which must have attracted Eve's
interest.

Eve describes in her words the first attempts to teach
indigenous people:

> After settling in Arequipa [in 1955] I began sharing
> my intentions to make friends with the natives, until a
> new Bahá'í told me that he had worked with peasants,
> though no longer used poncho, 160 but they came from
> the villages and spoke Quechua. We decided to hold
> a meeting with them in the constructor's office and
> three of his labourers entered the Faith. One of them
> named Victor said that during his vacation he would
> go to his people, would take literature and teach the
> Faith.

That year some American pioneers arrived which got the
Local Assembly consolidated and a booklet called'The Coming
of the Messengers of God' was published in Quechua.161

Eve Nickiin and BaháT friends at a picnic in Tiabaya, Arequipa

In Arequipa, Eve found work teaching English in the
Peruvian-North American Cultural Institute. Her first address
was to the Wagner Board, San Agustin Street 115 but later
she rented a house with Rosario Guerrero, a homefront pio­
neer. Eve used to invite her students to practice their English
but using Bahá'í books in that language. In the process of
translating them her students learn about the Faith. Many of
them became believers including two future members of the
National Spiritual Assembly.

A few months before her arrival, Arequipa had been visited
by Meche Sanchez and Yolanda Urteaga.There were other pio­
neers visiting Arequipa such as Wilma and Irvin Thomas, Patty
and Edward Beane and Pauline Dunn who stayed the lon­
gest assisting Eve. Many Lima friends also came and together
with their Arequipa friends went for picnics to the beautiful

countryside in Tiabaya y Sabandia. Finally, in March 1957 the
first Local Spiritual Assembly of Arequipa was formed with Eve
as one of its members

In April 1956 Eve traveled to Montevideo for the National
Assembly meeting. On her return trip she stayed six months in
Santiago doing Bahá'í work and waiting for her visa to enter Peru
again. At Ridván 1957 the new National Spiritual Assembly for
the five northern countries of South America (Brazil, Colombia,
Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela) was formed with Eve in its mem­
bership. The historical convention was held in Lima with the
attendance of the Hand of the Cause of God Horace Holley.

A few months later the devastating news of the passing
of the beloved Guardian in London 162 on 4 November 1957
was received. The Hand of the Cause Amatu'1-Bahá Rúhíyyih
Khánum. Shoghi Effendi's wife, cablegraphed this sad news to
the whole Bahä'i that had occurred at the midst of theTen Year
Crusade:

> BELOVED ALL HEARTS PRECIOUS GUARDIAN CAUSE
> GOD PASSED PEACEFULLY AWAY YESTERDAY AFTER
> ASIATIC FLU STOP APPEAL HANDS NATIONAL
> ASSEMBLIES AUXILIARY BOARDS SHELTER BELIEVERS
> ASSIST MEET HEARTRENDING SUPREME TEST STOP
> FUNERAL OUR BELOVED GUARDIAN SATURDAY
> LONDON HANDS ASSEMBLY BOARD MEMBERS INVITED
> ATTEND ANY PRESS RELEASE SHOULD STATE MEETING
> HANDS SHORTLY HAIFA WILL MAKE ARRANGEMENT
> TO BAHAI WORLD REGARDING FUTURE PLANS STOP
> URGE HOLD MEMORIAL MEETINGS SATURDAY.

RUHIYYIH 163

Eve Nicklin's consternation was evident as she had received
at least sixteen individual letters with loving guidance during
his ministry and many others as a member of the institutions.
At one point Eve had commented: "He [Shoghi Effendi] is so
dear to us all. How much we have learned to love him! He
has been our personal guide through all these years in South
America. How precious are all his letters"164

Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith

The Hands of the Cause of God who assumed the reins of
the Faith after Shoghi Effedi's passing called all believers to
raise up to complete the goals of the Ten Year Crusade and
work forward the election of the Universal Houstice in Ridvan
1963\. For the rest of the Crusade, believers around the world
rallied together and worked even harder in anticipation to
such an auspicious history-making event.

Encarnacion (Paraguay)

In the third year of her residence in Arequipa, the Western
Hemisphere Teaching Committee asked Eve if she could go
back to Paraguay in order to form a Local Spiritual Assembly
in Encarnacion, a simple town that most likely reminded her
of the ancestral Roanoke. Despite being the second important
city in Paraguay, Encarnacion was, in the words of a pioneer,
a "horse and buggy town" without paved streets, electric­
ity would go off for no apparent reason and there were no
facilities such as supermarkets and so on. Situated 230 miles
(372 km) away from the capital Asuncion, Encarnacion was
inhabited by a large indigenous population. It was founded
in 1615 by the Jesuits and eventually became a multicultural
city mostly with immigrants displaced by the two World Wars
such as the Ukranian, Polish, Czech, German, Russian, Italian
and Slovakians. The city is located on the Parana River across
Posadas on Argentine soil. In 1990 a modern bridge between
the two cities was completed but in Eve's times transportation
between the two cities was by boat.

The formation of a spiritual assembly in Encarnacion was
seen as fundamental for Paraguay to elect its independent
National Spiritual Assembly in 1961. Like many other Latin
American countries these national assemblies were consid­
ered the pillars of the Universal House of Justice which was
going to be formed in Ridván 1963.

Eve traveled to Paraguay in May 1959 and remained
there for four years. The Encarnacion assembly was formed
at Ridván I960, Eve being in the membership as well as Sra.
Adelina Piava, the first native Paraguayan Bahä'i.The pioneer
Margaret Mills Leonard, who later settled in the Falkland
Islands, Argentina, told us of those times in Encarnacion as
well as going to Posadas for teaching the Faith and do some
shopping. Posadas was located on the left-hand shore of the
Parana River, opposite to Encarnacion, on the Argentine side.
Margaret relates:

> We lived in Encarnacion, Paraguay, from 1960 to 1963.
> Alice Bacon and Reszi Sunshine were also pioneers
> there. Eve had an English academy on the hill. She lived
> in the back of the school and possessed only what is
> indispensable for her basic needs. Her students were
> very affectionate towards her and followed her home
> after class. Some of them became seekers and joined
> the Faith ... Eve adapted well to any circumstance. She

r

> may have had a lot of discomfort and inconvenience,
> but never complained.

I remember the trips we undertook to Posadas [by
> boat] on the Parana River. We had to spend several days
> in government offices before getting permission.165Eve
> waited patiently despite the fact that people pushed
> and pulled around. The following day we had to wait
> among a crowd in order to board the boat. Women
> with baskets of live chickens and ducks on their heads
> exchanged friendly words with us. In Posadas we used
> to rest in one of the cafes. The men were taking their
> coffee and talked about politics. Eve was very relaxed in
> any environment. She had the gift of being very social.

When she was seventy-three years of age, she came
> to visit me here in Falklands. She had more energy than
> both of us and insisted on exploring the surroundings
> after a long walk.

Eve did not get scared by frightening events.

> She lived in the upper suburbs of Encarnacion. Once
> during an aborted revolution, she was visiting the
> lower part of the city when a bomb hurled at the gas
> station almost next door to where she was visiting.The
> bomb was false. Eve was not scared. In addition, she
> lived alone for a year of political unrest with gunfire
> and soldiers everywhere.166

The pioneer Gilbert Grasselly recalls:

> I met Eve Nicklin for th e firsttim e in Paraguay in 1962.

She was a pioneer in the extreme south of Paraguay

> in the city of Encarnacion, a city having one of tw o
> local spiritual assemblies sustaining the National
> Spiritual Assembly, which was formed in 1961. Eve
> spoke Spanish with a strong American accent, but
> was easy to understand. Her favorite method of
> teaching the faith was by using illustrated albums.
> She spent a lot of time preparing her albums and
> illustrated materials and never taught the Faith
> w ithout them.

Everyone loved Eve ... She always had a warm and
> loving smile for everyone and was ready to laugh even
> if she was surrounded by difficulties and problems. I
> rarely saw her sad and I cannot recall having seen her
> depressed. She relied heavily on prayer and I remember
> how worn her prayer book was.167

David Baral also wrote her impressions of Eve:

> To me she symbolized many of the virtues of the
> first group of pioneers, especially in perseverance
> throughout extended periods and under difficult
> conditions. She has been properly considered as
> the mother of the Peruvian Bahá'í Community, but
> something very similar could be said of her services in
> Paraguay. She returned to Paraguay at different times
> in the history of the Faith; contributed to the teaching
> and consolidation work in many different ways; and
> certainly had a significant impact on the growth of
the Paraguayan Bahá'í Community. This was fulfilled

> in such a simple and modest way that many failed to
> recognize the extent of her contributions until many
> years later.168

Encarnacion, Paraguay circa 1958 - Sitting in front Eve Nicklin

Eve's work with indigenous people continued on in
Paraguay particularly among the Guarani natives of El Chaco.
In 1961 she received an invitation from the National Spiritual
Assembly of Bolivia to assist in a training course for Bahá'ís
teachers among indigenous populations. En route to Peru,
she first went to Oruro and La Paz, crossed Lake Titicaca at
12,500 feet above sea level and then went by train to Arequipa
to reunite with her"Bahá'í family" who met her at the station.
From there she flew to Lima where the friends, glad to see her,
celebrated her 66th birthday.

The return to Bolivia for the Indigenous Congress followed
the same route. Of frail health due to her advanced age, she
was impressed by seeing for the first time, the process of entry
by troops. BahďíNews reports that:

> The first Indian Congress of Bolivia was held in Oruro on
> Feb. 21-25, 1961, with 116 Indians participating. They
> came from forty-six different places in Bolivia. Visiting
> teachers were Eve Nicklin and Edmond Miessler. At the
> end of the sessions twenty-two new believers were
> enrolled. The activities in Bolivia during the past year
> have been mostly devoted to deepening the knowledge
> of new believers and preparing them for the historic first
> National Spiritual Assembly of Bolivia.This has been done
> through extensive programs of visiting their villages or
> inviting them to the summer school, different classes
> and conferences. Just before Ridván 1961, the number
> of Indian believers has passed the one thousand mark.169

As said, this was an unforgettable experience for Eve, one
that she would like to replicate in other areas. The way was
being prepared for undertaking mass conversion in Peru.

A well-deserved break

Cusco (Peru)

On her way back to Encarnacion, Paraguay, Eve received a let­
ter from the National Assembly requesting her to go to the
Cusco region in the Peruvian Andes to begin a mass teach­
ing project for the first time. By then, the Bahá'í community of
Encarnacion had grown and was consolidated. Eve accepted
the challenge and settled in Urubamba in 1962 getting previ­
ous permission from the National Assembly of Paraguay.

Urubamba is a small rural town in the Cusco region which
means "flat land of spiders". It is situated at an altitude of 9,500
feet in the Sacred Valley of the Incas along the banks of the
Urubamba River and under the snow-capped Andean moun­
tains. To reach Urubamba the traveler needs to take a road
trip which in Eve's time could have taken two hours. It is a
beautiful but isolated place surrounded by small agricul­
tural land parcels cultivated by millenniums by Quechua-
speaking peasants living still in the traditions of the great
Inca culture. A small market of vegetables, native clothes and
handicrafts adds to its picturesque landscape with occasional
tourists and backpackers. The 17th century historian Antonio
de Leon called it the biblical Garden of Eden due to its natural
beauty, peacefulness and fertile land. Peruvians usually talked
about telluric forces vibrating in the sacred Urubamba valley
which no doubt were energized by Baha'u'llah's revelation
that Eve brought.

The presence of a foreign lady of advanced age in the
town must have caused some degree of curiosity in the popu­
lation who, due to its small size, each other knew very well. It
must have also been a totally new experience used as she was

to urban settings. Any outsider must have felt in such a rustic
environment a sense of crude solitude. Eve, however, related
of her experiences while in Urubamba with a spirit impreg­
nated of adventure and fondness:

> In Cusco I found a young man of Arequipa who
> had gone [to Arequipa] for a few months and then
> returned. He had given me a letter of introduction to
> the inspector of schools in Urubamba, 170 the Sacred
> Valley of the Incas. He helped me to find a place with
> two rooms for renting. Through the director of the
> Cultural Institute I found some English classes to teach
> at the Normal School of Urubamba. I settled in but still I
> needed a translator to communicate with the Quechua
> indigenous people.

I wrotetothe National Spiritual Assembly requesting
> to send me the two young men that I knew. Victor
> was from Arequipa, and the other, Fidel Flores from
> Huancayo. Victor stayed for three months and Fidel
> for a month. I had a room in the patio and I arranged
> it for them. This was our headquarters in Urubamba.
> The two youths began to go up the mountains in
> search of souls, sometimes spending the nights in
> villages.

On one of those trips they met Exaltacion Quispe.

> He had been sitting in the plaza of Urubamba.
> Victor gave him the Good News of God. Since then,
> Exaltacion frequented my house very often. He
> was from a village called Ocutuan, four hours away
> from Urubamba. He, for some reason, had to see

■

the authorities. One day I told him that Bahá'u'lláh
had said: 'My calamity is My providence, outwardly
it is fire and vengeance, but inwardly it is light and
mercy.'171

With the innate understanding that indigenous
people have, he understood it. Exaltacion was the first
Bahá'í from Cusco. Victor and Fidel returned home.
Exaltacion brought the friends and relatives who
could, and served as a translator because he spoke
both Spanish and Quechua.

With native Bahá'ís in Urubamba, Peru

One day he told me that if Fidel or Victor return, he
would introduce them to the people of his village and
other villages. We sent the message to the National
Assembly. Fidel returned in early 1963. Fidel Flores

> came back to Urubamba and went to visit the people,
> especially Ocutuan, to teach the Faith and also to work
> with the friends on their farms. However he could not
> stay there long. The friends, when they could travel
> the distance of four hours of walking, brought me
> potatoes as a gift. They liked the flowers I had in the
> yard, especially the women who asked for them to
> adorn their hair, as was their custom. They liked the
> prayers and Exaltacion Quispe learned several of them
> and when he went to Ocutuan or vice versa, he used to
> say them on the road.

That is how mass conversion began in the region of Cusco.

Before the Ten Year Crusade ended, Exaltacion Quispe and
Fidel Flores had managed to form the Local Spiritual Assembly
of Ocutuan. Now we have others in the region, of course. We
had our first training school for people from the villages.
A meeting was conducted in Lima with representatives of
Huancayo, Cusco and Puno. It was on the trip that Fidel Flores
made for such a meeting, when he felt very ill and never recov­
ered. He died and went to the Kingdom of Abha. We had tes­
timony from peoples from the villages that felt his spirit influ­
encing them and encouraging them to carry forward the work
of teaching to whose cause he gave his life so devotedly.172

A HANDMAID OF 'ABDU'L-BAHÄ

After her work in Cusco and until her death in 1985 this vet­
eran warrior kept battling in places so geographically apart as
Trujillo (Peru), Encarnacion (Paraguay), Caracas (Venezuela),
and lea and Lima (Peru) as well as on embarking on innumer­
able travel teaching trips throughout South America visiting
and encouraging communities and individuals.

Interestingly, Nicklin is an Anglo-Norman name meaning
conqueror derived from the Greek words nikon (to conquer)
and laos (people). Although probably unaware of such etymo­
logic background Eve had became a true conqueror of cita­
dels and lands for the Faith of Baha'u'llah. She was certainly
an extremely talented conqueror but one for whom human
hearts were her ultimate treasure.

In doing so, Eve's life was always guided by higher order
insights and metaphors making her a being of considerable
spiritual perception and radiance. Many Baha'is remembered

her as a woman of great kindheartedness, tolerance and tact
whose life touched so many people in so many different places.
Curiously, the name Eve stands for "life-giving" in Hebrew. On
one of her books she drew a picture of a lamp sitting on a win­
dow and wrote the poem "But Let There Be Light" reflecting on
her own spiritual life:

> I will open my window
> In the morning
> To let in God's light
> And then at eventime
> I will place
> A candle there to
> Shine out - out
> Into the night.

1963 was a unique year for the Baha'i World due to the first
election of the Universal House of Justice, the supreme body
of the administrative order of the Bahá'í Faith, an institution
created by Bahá'u'lláh Himself in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the Most
Holy Book. The national spiritual assemblies supported by
their local spiritual assemblies were the pillar upon which the
Universal House of Justice would be established. We all know
how hard Eve worked to build and develop Baha'i national
communities throughout the subcontinent since her first
arrival to Brazil in 1937.

Ten South American national spiritual assemblies were
among a total of the fifty-six pillars upon the Universal House
of Justice was first erected, namely Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil,
Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and
Venezuela. They were all represented in the first election that
took place on April 21,1963 in the Holy Land.

A Handmaid o f'Abdu'1-Bahá

In the same month Eve traveled to London for the sub­
sequent Great Jubilee that took place commemorating the
centenary of the Declaration of Bahá'u'lláh and the election
of the first Universal House of Justice. She visited the United
States on her way to see relatives and friends after ten years of
absence. The London event congregated about 6,000 Bahá'ís
from all over the world met at the Albert Royal Hall. Surely
it must have been a wonderful experience for Eve who was
always used to small groups in remote places. At the Great
Jubilee most of the Hands of the Cause of God were also pres­
ent providing a unique spiritual environment to the celebra­
tions. The Universal House of Justice referred to this great

■

The Ten Year Crusade was followed by the Nine Year Plan.

In October 1963, the Universal House of Justice announced
that the Nine Year Plan constituted "the second of those
world-encircling enterprises destined in the course of time
to carry the Word of God to every human soul".174The House
also announced that the Bahá'í Faith was entering "... a new
epoch, the third of the Formative Age. It must now grow rap­
idly in size, increase its spiritual cohesion and executive ability,
develop its institutions and extend its influence into all strata
of society."175

On the ensuing years until her passing in 1985, Eve dedi­
cated her life to serve on three world plans enunciated by the
Universal House of Justice, namely, the Nine Year Plan (1964-
1973), the Five Year Plan (1974-1979) and the Seven Year Plan
(1979-1986). These three plans encompassed the third epoch
of the Formative Age of the Bahá'í Faith.144-176

Eve had the privilege of serving in the first three epochs
of the Formative Age which were consecutively led by the
beloved Guardian (1921-1957), the Hands of the Cause of
God (1957-1963) and the Universal House of Justice (1963
onwards).

The Nine Year Plan (1964-1973)

The Nine Year Plan was a busy period in Eve's Life as she had to
undertake several international teaching missions frequently
travelling as an Auxiliary Board member, throughout South
America as well as attending Bahá'í functions such as confer­
ences, conventions and summer schools. During this Plan Eve

A Handmaid o f'Abdu'1-Bahá

also settled as a pioneer in Trujillo (Peru), Venezuela and back
in Paraguay at the request of the Bahá'í institutions.

Trujillo (Peru)

Trujillo is popularly known as the "City of Eternal Spring" It is
situated at over 500 miles (800 km) north of Lima, the capital
of Peru, being its third largest city. Gifted with a benign and
sunny climate throughout the year, Trujillo was founded in
1534 and had a long cultural tradition of musical and cultural
festivals. Rich in colonial architecture, it stays close to the site
of the great Chimu civilization whose main city is considered
the world's largest adobe city. Eve must have been found her­
self at ease in this beautiful and pleasant city also because of
its traditionally friendly population.

In 1964 Eve went to live in Trujillo where there was already
a small Bahá'í group. She lived in a building called Klar on a
main street where she had her Baha'i meetings with contacts
obtained through her English classes. Eve was visited by sev­
eral members of the Lima community. She was also visited by
the Hand of the Cause Mr. Jalál Kházeh who later continued
to Cajamarca on the Peruvian Andes to visit the Leon family,
homefront pioneers there. We also know that Eve visited the
Leons in Cajamarca on a different occasion.

Along with pioneer Patty Beane, Eve visited the Amazon
region in the months of June and July 1964. On this journey
they visited Iquitos, Leticia (Colombia), Marcos (Brazil), Ramón
Castilla, Islandia and Puerto Alegria (Peru). They traveled by
river motor boat facing all kinds of obstacles. That visit proved

to be of great success, especially in places where there were
scattered believers and also was instrumental in exploring fur­
ther possibilities for improving the Bahá'í work in the Amazon
jungle.

Venezuela

From Trujillo Eve traveled for a month to Arequipa to
strengthen the Local Spiritual Assembly in September 1964.
In the next year she went back to the Andes visiting com­
munities in Cusco. By 1965 there were fifteen local spiritual
assemblies in Peru. Also in 1965, she received the news of her
appointment by the Hands of the Cause of God as a member
of the Auxiliary Board of Propagation in Venezuela where she
stayed for two years engaged in teaching the Faith and deep­
ening the believers.

Eve then was seventy years old, and travelling broadly,
her pioneering spirit strong, and accomplishing all her duties
with excellence. For example, in July and August of the same
year, she participated in the Regional Bahá'í Congresses in
Georgetown, Guyana, as well as in Bogota (Colombia) in the
company of the Hand of the Cause of God Mr. Jalál Kházeh.
In February 1967 she was attending and teaching in a summer
school in Lima surrounded again by her spiritual children who
had grown vastly in numbers.

Paraguay again

A few months later, Mr. Kházeh was informing all the national
spiritual assemblies and members of the Auxiliary Board that

A Handmaid of 'Abdu'1-Bahá

"the well-known and beloved Auxiliary Board member Miss
Eve Nicklin" will be assigned to Paraguay.

On the way to that country Eve passed through Brazil and
participated in its seventh national convention held in Aguas
de Lindonia. Also, in October 1967 Eve attended a teaching
conference in Panama for laying the foundation stone of the
Bahá'í Temple in Panama, and at Ridván of 1968 Eve partici­
pated in the National Convention of Uruguay as a representa­
tive of the Hands of the Cause of God.

Eve also traveled to the First Oceanic Conference in
Palermo in the island of Sicily, Italy, which commemorated
the centenary of the arrival of Bahá'u'lláh in the Holy Land
in August 1968. This was a memorable event with more than
2,300 Bahá'ís attending including the Hands of the Cause of

God Ugo Giachery, 'Alí-Akbar Furútan, Dhikrďlláh Khádem,
Adelbert Mühlschlegel, Jalál Kházeh, Paul Haney, Enoch
Olinga, William Sears, John Ferraby, Rahmatďlláh Muhájir
and Abul-Qásim Faizi. About 1,800 friends from the Palermo
Conference gathered together again in the Holy Land for the
commemoration observance.

From the conference she traveled to Haifa for pilgrimage
to the Holy Shrines. According to Gilbert Grasselly:

> As Eve aged, she became more forgetful. In 1967, she
> expressed her desire to go to the Palermo Conference
> ... and we encouraged her to go. She lamented that
> she did not have money enough to go and that the
> traveller's checks that she had been saving would
> not be enough. We suggested she gather up her
> papers and together we began to add up the totals
> of unused checks. We discovered to her surprise
> that she had enough money for both her travel and
> her expenses. The itinerary of the conference also
> included a pilgrimage to the Bahá'í World Centre
> and this would be Eve's first visit to these holy
> places.

There is no doubt that the happiest time of her life
> was her visit to the Holy Shrines of the Faith that she
> had served as a pioneer since the launching of the First
> Seven Year Plan of the beloved Guardian. She returned
> from this trip immensely strengthened and radiant
> and it was the subject of her conversations for several
> months afterwards. This visit to the Holy Land, without
> a doubt, sustained her until the end of her days.177

Memories of her first years in South America must have
crossed her mind thinking of her beloved Guardian who had
sustained her from that Sacred Spot through long periods of
solitude. It was Shoghi Effendi who had been accompanied her
through correspondence since the early days of her becoming
a Baha'i. It was he who had guided her through at least fifteen
letters until his sudden passing in 1957. Not having the oppor­
tunity of meeting her "true and grateful brother" during her life,
the occasion was in due time to kneel in gratitude at the Holy
Thresholds for all the bounties she had received in the path
of her Lord. After thirty years of ceaselessly work, the Cause
was now established in South America with native believers
increasingly assuming their responsibility with devotion and
steadfastness. Her pioneering dreams had come through but
there was plenty of more victories still to be won.

Eve's return to Paraguay coincided with a surge in teach­
ing activities. She was present at the Regional South American
Proclamation Conference at Porto Alegre, Brazil, held in the
first week of September 1967, which was attended by Baha'is
from Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil. The Hand
of the Cause of God Dr. Rahmatďlláh Muhájir was present
continuing next to Asuncion, Paraguay, where he met and
addressed the community. Baha'i News reports the spiritual
momentum at such a historical visit and the progress that the
Paraguayan community had already achieved in a matter of a
few decades:

> The National Spiritual Assembly of Bahá'ís of Paraguay
> has accepted the additional goal of opening the eight
> Departments still virgin to the Faith. Many of the
> friends have undertaken vigorous teaching projects.

> The "Asamblea Espiritual Nacional de los Bahá'ís del
> Paraguay" is now listed officially as an associated non­
> governmental organization working with the United
> Nations information center in Paraguay. The second
> annual Winter School for Paraguay was held in Asuncion
> August 23-25,1969 ...The National Spiritual Assembly's
> plan for raising the number of local assemblies from
> eight to thirteen, and the number of groups from
> eighteen to twenty-one, met with enthusiasm. With
> much joy, after years of strenuous sacrifice, the first
> all-Indian institute in the Chaco, Paraguay, was held
> October 25-26, 1969. Among the delegates were
> Guarani, Guasurango, and Chulupi Indians.This historic
> institute was the first where all classes were taught in
> Guarani, the native language of Paraguay. Auxiliary
> Board member Eve Nicklin and three Paraguayan
> traveling teachers... assisted in teaching the classes.178

Eve continued to travel extensively until the end of the
Nine Year Plan in spite of health problems. She traveled to
Bolivia and Argentina in 1970 for Bahá'í activities. The follow­
ing year she went again to Argentina and in December 1971
Eve traveled to the meeting of the Counsellors and Auxiliary
Board members held in January 1972 in Lima. That same year,
from Paraguay where she lived, Eve traveled to the United
States for health reasons.

The Five Year Plan (1974-1979)

This Five Year Plan also took Eve to several teaching engage­
ments and to a new pioneering post despite her advanced

age and frailty. The Plan goaK as enunciated by the Universal
House of Justice, were:"presdpiation and consolidation of the
victories won; a vast and widespread expansion of the Bahá'í
community; development of the distinctive character of Bahá'í
life particularly in the local communities"179

With the Bahá'í youth of Lima, 1975

In June 1975 we found Eve in Lima participating in the
National Teaching Conference. The conference was attended
by the Hand of the Cause 'Amatu'1-Bahá Rúhíyyih Khánum.
widow of the Guardian — who was visiting on the occasion of
the "Green Light" Expedition. At that conference 'Amatďl-Bahá
Rúhíyyih Khánum instructed Eve to speak about the Bahá'í
history of Peru. She returned to Lima after three months and
remained in the capital for one week during the Counsellors'
meeting. The Counsellors decided to ask Eve to return to Peru.
She therefore traveled to Paraguay in order to fix things up
and was back in Lima after three weeks. It was now September
of 1975.

Rúhíyyih Khánum and Eve in Lima

Already octogenarian, Eve Nicklin pioneered in 1976

to the coastal city of lea in order to assist with the goals of
the Five Year Plan, lea, at 153 miles (246 km) south of Lima,
is known as the "Land of the Sun" because of the many
months of sunshine all year-round. Surrounded by vast sand
deserts, like an oasis, lea stands as the capital of a region
rich in cotton and vineyards. Various pre-Spanish cultures,
some 10,000 years old, flourished in the region including
the famous Nasca lines. During the Spanish domination it
drew a large slave population which was sent to the haci­
endas to do agricultural work, lea is also distinguished by its
people's affability and receptivity and that facilitated much
Eve's mission.

Rahmatu'llah Muhájir at the Summer School, Lima, 1977

In the company of the homefront pioneer Dora Bravo, and
at the request of the National Spiritual Assembly, Eve aimed at
establishing a Local Spiritual Assembly there, a goal that even­
tually was achieved.

Dora Bravo and Eve Nicklin did a wonderful job in lea. Dora
worked as seamstress while Eve taught English. Both were liv­
ing in one room without comforts, going to the university to
teach the Message of Faith and then forming a club in their
bedroom. Eve was surrounded by young people who sat on
her bed or on the floor and were attracted by the love of this

old lady, this servant of 'Abdu'1-Bahá. Even when her physical
and mental capacities were diminished, she was still opening
the rest of Peru to the Faith. Dora relates that in the neighbour­
hood there was an eight-year-old boy, so attracted by Eve's
love, who every morning without fail would accompany Eve
for her usual walk. For Dora Bravo, being allowed that period
of time to be with Eve was a "reward from God".

Eve attended the International Bahá'í Teaching Conference
in Bahia, Brazil, in January 1977. That was the city that forty
years ago had been the first arena of her South American
services along with Leonora Armstrong. 'AbduTBahá had
referred to this city in His Tablets of the Divine Plan: "Visit ye
especially the city of Bahia, on the eastern shore of Brazil.
Because in the past years this city was christened with the
name, BAHIA, there is no doubt that it has been through
the inspiration of the Holy Spirit."180 Both distinguished
luminaries would meet again in Lima in the occasion of the
first International Conference of the Baha'i Women in South
America held between December 1,1977, and January 1,1978
which was attended by 200 women from ten South American
republics as well as from the United States, Australia, France,
New Zealand, Panama and Trinidad. Great victories they were
witnessing after years of laborious work.

They shared several things in common. While Leonora was
the "Mother of South America" Eve became the "Mother of
Peru" and in a way of Paraguay too. Both were long standing
pioneers, thefirsttw o to arrive to South America, having served
hand-to-hand in Brazil during Shoghi Effendi's first Seven Year
Plan in 1937. Leonora had been appointed to the Continental
Board of Counsellors for the Protection and Propagation of the
Baha'i Faith in South America and Eve was serving as member

of their Auxiliary Board for Propagation. They also lived long
lives, being of the same age and finally passed away at their
original pioneering posts with their lives profusely celebrated
by the Universal House of Justice. Both had been encouraged
by the Hand of the Cause of God Martha Root to continue her
1919 teaching endeavours in South America. Leonora and
Eve were now certainly witnessing the growth of the spiritual
tree promised by 'Abdu'1-Bahá to Martha Root which "shall
eternally put forth leaves and blossoms and yield fruits, and
whose shadow shall day by day grow in magnitude".11

The Bahá'í Conference was also a great success. It was one
of the eight international teaching conferences called by the
Universal House of Justice held at the middle of the Five Year
Plan. The Hands of the Cause of God Amatu'1-Bahá Rúhíyyih
Khánum, Enoch Olinga and Paul Haney attended the event
along with thirteen hundred believers from thirty-seven
countries and seventeen indigenous tribes from the Americas.
It must have been a rewarding confirmation to Eve's and
Leonora's spiritual and material struggles four decades ago.
The momentum built at the end of the Plan was transmitted
to the new Seven Year Plan where each national community
had been given goals for these first two years, "designed to
continue the process of expansion, to consolidate the victo­
ries won, and to attain, where circumstances permit, any goals
that may have had to remain unaccomplished at the end of
the Five Year Plan."181

The Seven Year Plan (1979-1986)

A fall at the Lima summer school the following month forced
Eve's return from lea to Lima forever. She remained under the

loving care of Baha'i families and believers of Lima. Eventually
she went to live in a geriatric clinic and finally stayed on the
second floor of the National Hazíratu'1-Quds for her four last
years of her life — visited and always surrounded by her many
spiritual children. Less mobile, Eve always maintained her
always encouraging nature, deepening the friends, sharing
stories about the early history of the Baha'i Faith in Peru as well
as showing them and explaining her many teaching pictorial
albums.

Until the closing stages of her life, Eve continued to teach
through her albums. The author evokes with much fondness
this old and frail lady, using a walking stick, with white hair
and a strong American accent, sharing her albums with visi­
tors at the Baha'i Center of Lima where she was stationed.
Over the years she had developed the skills of conveying com­
prehensively deep concepts with ease and familiarity through
pictures that connected the reader to real life situations. Eve
used to leave her albums on a small table at the Baha'i Center
for anyone to peruse through at their own pace and time. The
creative composition of content grasped almost immediately
people's curiosity and impelled them to go through more
albums. In her visual aids, in teaching Indigenous people, in
her community building, detachment and courage, in her
work with youth and children, she was certainly ahead of her
times.

Her persona had certainly evolved from being a sim­
ple country girl into an icon of service to humanity and for
that, with justice, she had entered history. No doubt the
austere years of the ancestral Roanoke as the daughter of
an immigrant coalminer had made an everlasting imprint
of resilience and persistence on the young Eve accounting

for such a splendidly uninterrupted international record.
Unquestionably, the strong family religiosity had contributed
to valuing the sacred and the godly in her life. Some might be
inclined to ponder how well her Methodist missionary train­
ing had skilled her in the art of building communities and
empowering people. Whether in the provincial Bahia, the citi­
fied Lima, the dreary Encarnacion, the remote Punta Arenas
or the rustic Urubamba, there was something convincing Eve
of the spiritual worthiness of her endeavors. In the final analy­

> sis, her powerful belief in seeking divine assistance to achieve
> success was a major life driver.

Many friends recall this bedridden ninety-year-old lady in
her very last year, with her mind suspended between heav­
ens and earth, only able to articulate loudly the invocation Yá
Bahďu'1-Abhá (O Thou Glory of the Most Glorious) that had
galvanized her fifty-five years of uninterrupted services to the
Cause of Baha'u'llah in North and South America.

On June 10, 1985, a few months away from the conclu­
sion of the Seven Year Plan, at nine o'clock in the National
Hazíratu'1-Quds in Lima, far away from the Roanoke prairies,
Eve Nicklin passed away after a long illness at the age of ninety
years. Eve had ended her services in this world to start them in
the Kingdom of Abhá, blessing forever Peruvian soil, a country
that she always called home, becoming worthy then of those
words of her Lord:

> They that have forsaken their country in the path of
> God and subsequently ascended unto His presence,
> such souls shall be blessed by the Concourse on High
> and their names recorded by the Pen of Glory among

> such as have laid down their lives as martyrs in the
> path of God, the Help in peril, the Self Subsisting.182

Following a night vigil at the National Hazíratu'1-Quds,
Eve Nicklin was laid to rest on June 11 at four o'clock in the
afternoon in the new section of the same British Cemetery
where John Stearns — the Spiritual father of Ecuador — both
Jamestown citizens, had been buried forty years before. The
cemetery is located in the same port city that saw her arriving
in 1941 with fifty dollars and no language.

There were over a hundred people in attendance, many
children, including Eve's former students and three members
of her Universal Friendship Club. Dr. Aguilar, the longest sur­
vivor member, read an emotive eulogy outlining the begin­
nings of the Club back to the 1940s and praising Eve's dedica­
tion, patience and love in establishing the Faith of Baha'u'llah
in Peruvian soil.

At her passing, the Universal House of Justice praised Eve's
life with these uplifting terms:

> SADDENEDLEARNPASSINGAUXILIARYBOARDMEMBER
> EVE NICKLIN DEVOTEDSTEADFASTHANDMAIDABDU'L-
> BAHA HER MANY YEARS DISTINGUISHED SUCCESSFUL

With Dr. David Ruhe, member of the Universal

House of Justice visiting in Lima, in the 1980s

She who as an infant at her mother's deathbed was put"in
the hands of God"had now returned unto Him ennobled as the
spiritual mother of a nation by providential means. Forty-four
years after her arrival to Peru, at the time of her passing, the
local assemblies in Peru had reached six hundred in number
184while her spiritual children could be counted in thousands.

With her passing a momentous period in the history of the
Baha'i Faith in South America had been enriched, one which
represented a continuous wave of indomitable believers pre­
dominantly women, who left everything at once and oblivi­
ous of uncertainty, discomfort and strangeness ventured
themselves to open new territories to the Faith of Baha'u'llah.
