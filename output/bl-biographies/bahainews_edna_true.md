Edna M. True, whose matchless services to the Cause of God in North America and Europe spanned nearly a century, died peacefully in her sleep December 9 in Wilmette, Illinois, close to the Mother Temple of the West that was so dear to her heart.

Upon learning of Miss True's passing some four months after her 100th birthday, the Universal House of Justice cabled:

> "Her long period outstanding dedicated services Cause, especially illumined by her attainment presence beloved Master and personal acquaintance Shoghi Effendi, comprised wide range historically significant contributions as stalwart pillar American Bahá'í community during critical decades its early administrative development and as single-minded, energetic, resourceful promoter European Bahá'í community whose rise after second World War is forever linked with her extensive activities for 17 years behalf European Teaching Committee.

> 
> "Her memorable membership Continental Board of Counselors North America and Trusteeship Continental Fund crowned century-long, exemplary life wholly worthy her illustrious Bahá'í heritage."

Miss True, who was born July 29, 1888, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, lived most of her life in the Chicago area including the last 59 years in Wilmette.

She was a daughter of the Hand of the Cause of God Corinne Knight True whose valiant work from 1909-25 as financial secretary of Bahá'í Temple Unity was instrumental in building the House of Worship in Wilmette.

Corinne True died April 3, 1961, only seven months short of her 100th birthday.

Edna True was formally enrolled in the Faith as a 15-year-old in 1903, the same year in which Orville and Wilbur Wright flew the first heavier-than-air plane at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.

Six years later she was graduated from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, where she had excelled in academics and sports and captained the basketball team.

She was a young woman of 23 in 1912 when 'Abdu'l-Bahá visited Chicago and laid the cornerstone for the House of Worship in a ceremony on May 1 of that year.

Like her mother, Miss True became intimately involved in the completion of that magnificent edifice, serving on its construction committee from 1947-53, lending her expertise to interior design, and helping to plan its formal dedication in 1953.

During World War I Miss True was a part of the Smith College Relief Unit in France, ministering to the needs of U.S. servicemen overseas.

From 1940-46 she was a member of the Bahá'í Inter-America Committee, serving as its chairman in 1941-42 and secretary in 1945-46.

Harry Truman was president in 1946 when Miss True was elected to membership on the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States. She served as recording secretary for the next 22 years.

Meanwhile, she served as chairman of the European Teaching Committee for the entire span of its existence (1946-64), putting her organizational skills to work to help form local Spiritual Assemblies and, later, National Spiritual Assemblies in 11 European countries.

Professionally, Miss True was the founder and manager of North Shore Travel Service in Evanston, a position whose many contacts overseas helped greatly in her work with the European Teaching Committee.

In 1968, now 80 years old, Miss True was named by the Universal House of Justice as a member of the Continental Board of Counsellors for the Americas.

She served with distinction as a Counsellor and Trustee of the Continental Fund until 1981 when advancing years (she was then 93) forced her to reduce her activities.

Miss True remained an active member of the Wilmette Bahá'í community almost to her last year, regularly attending Feasts and other gatherings with her longtime friend and companion, Thelma Jackson.

In 1986, Miss True and Miss Jackson made a pilgrimage to the World Centre in Haifa, Israel, where they visited the Holy Shrines and were entertained by members of the Universal House of Justice.

On her 99th birthday in July 1987, the National Spiritual Assembly presented Miss True a scroll recognizing her many years of service to the U.S. Bahá'í community.

From the National Teaching Committee, she received a framed copy of the commemorative print honoring the 75th anniversary of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's visit to North America.

In return, she presented to 19 young volunteers at the National Center copies of _The Dawning Place,_ Bruce Whitmore's book about the building of the Mother Temple of the West.

Funeral services for Miss True were held December 15 with burial in the True family plot at Chicago's Oak-woods Cemetery.

The first of the memorial services in her honor was held two days later during the "Vision to Victory" conference in Chicago. Among those paying tribute to her exemplary life of service were David Hofman, a former member of the Universal House of Justice; Dr. Wilma Ellis, director-general of the Bahá'í International Community; and Judge Dorothy W. Nelson, chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly.

Also presented was a brief audiovisual retrospective of Miss True's life and services to the Cause of God.
