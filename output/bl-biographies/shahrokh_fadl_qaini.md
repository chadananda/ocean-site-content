WINDOWS TO THE PAST
by Darius K. Shahrokh, M.D.

Set your trap for another bird, 0 trapper!

Why?
For I am the phoenix and my nest is way up high."

In the soul-stirring Hidden Words, Baha'u'llah states " 0 Immortal
Phoenix! Dwell not save on the mount of faithfulness. Therein
is thy habitation, if on the wings of thy soul thou soarest to
the realm of the infinite and seekest to attain thy goal." (Persian
Hidden Words # 1)

At one time, these windows to the past opened to the enchanting
warble of the nightingales, and at another time, to the mesmerizing
flight of the two heavenly doves, Varqa and Ruhu'llah. This time
it shall open to the awesome scene of the taming of that immortal
and legendary bird, the phoenix. So let this window from these
ageless windows to the past open to the life story of Aqa
Muhammad-i-Qa'ini, also known as Fadl-i-Qa ini, meaning the learned
one from Qa'in. The title of Nabil-i-Akbar was bestowed upon him
by Baha'u'llah.   He should not be mistaken for Nabil-i-A'zam, the
great historian who wrote The Dawn-Breakers.        The given name
of both men was Muhammad.      In Arabic numerology of Abjad the
numbers of Nabil equal the numbers of Muhammad. The meaning of
Nabil is noble or learned.

We shall refer to our star as Fadl.

This great man was a prodigy among the scholars of his time and
was instrumental in the conversion of Mirza Abu'l Fadl. When Mirza
Abu'l Fad1 was yet a Muslim and occupying the position of professor
and president of the highest Islamic college in Tehran, after one

encounter with Fadl, he was heard to say, "By God, no one could
withstand the power of this great man of knowledge."

Once in a southern city in Iran called Kerman, Fad1 appeared in
a gathering of the learned and divines. He was not wearing the
customary turban which would denote his rank, but wore an ordinary
hat and no one recognized him. After listening to his discourse
on the subject being discussed, they said no one can rival this
stranger's eloquence and erudition except the famous Fadl-i-Qaini,
which was himself. Rather amusing for Fad1 to hear that.

Haji Mirza Haydar- Ali, one of the great teachers whom Abdu'l-Baha
honored with the title of The Angel of Carmel, and also the writer
of the book The Delight of Hearts, said this about Fadl.    Should
Fad1 state that fire is wet and cold might as well accept it or
with logic he would convince you. Both these learned people, Mirza
Abu'l-Fad1 and Mirza Haydar-'Ali, when at the gatherings of the
believers with Fad1 present, would not utter a word.     Matter of
fact, when smoking indoors was a common practice, Mirza Abu'l-Fad1
who was a chain smoker, would not smoke in the presence of Fad1
until Fad1 who realized his addiction, would ask him to smoke.

Who was this unusual man whose good looks complemented all his
other great qualities? In the course of this story, you will learn
why it was decided to call his story 'The Taming of the Phoenix.'

Well----it is a rather long story, but an exciting one. You shall
witness how the phoenix arose from his smoldering ashes, and how
on the wings of his soul he soared to the realm of abiding light.
By the end of this hour, hopefully, you will find it well spent
but, please, a word of caution.

The stories of these early believers should not be considered as
fables or taken for entertainment. These are accounts of those
who were so overwhelmed with love for Bahalulllahthat they forsook
their homes, family, wealth, fame and name.       But they left for
posterity a legacy of what is meant by being a lover of Baha'u'llah.
Such love comes only after true recognition resulting in utter
humility and feeling of nothingness. With this commentary before
we start, might as well share with you the story of a beautiful
raindrop by Saadi, the great Persian poet of the 13th century.

From a lofty cloud this pure drop of rain began its descent. Soon
it became conscious of its own qualities so with pride told itself,
'1

I am the water of life. All existence depends on me."    Swollen
with self-admiration and pride, suddenly it looked down and saw
the vast ocean beneath it.     Dumbfounded, it said, "By God, if
that is water, then who am I?" Filled with remorse and utter
humility, it fell on the ocean.   The mighty ocean, with admiration
and love, embraced the drop and made at the companion of the pearl.
How beautifully expressive of the paradox of the greatness in
humility.

And now the story.

To start this story without adequate introduction is not proper.
Baha'u'llah revealed the Tablet of Wisdom, or Lawh-i-Hikmat, in
honor of Fadl, and after Fad1 passed away, Abdu'l-Baha accorded
him the rank of a Hand of the Cause. Later on Shoghi Effendi
designated him as one of the nineteen Apostles of Baha'u'llah.
To complete the list of honors, the degree of ijtihad which is
a doctorate in Islamic law must be mentioned. One cannot find
too many people with all of the above.

- Masabeh-i-Hidayat, Volume I in Persian language by

Azizu'llah Sulaymani was the foundation for this

presentation.
Fad1 was born on March 29, 1829, and passed away after the ascension
of Baha'u'llah in 1892. His place of birth was the small town
of Naw-Firist in the District of Qa in in the large province of
-
Khurasan. He came from a family of eminent clerics and received
the usual religious education in his home town.

After his basic education, at the age of 17 he left home for
advanced studies. First he went to Maahad, the capital of the
province.   While there he became interested in the study of
philosophy. So he travelled to Sabzivar where Haji Mulla Mihdi,
the most eminent Persian philosopher of the 19th century, was
conducting classes.

After five years, he returned home, but did not stay long due to
repeated heated arguments with his father over differences in
understanding of certain principles. Where to go? Of course,
nowhere else except to his illustrious and favorite teacher of
philosophy. The teacher insisted that Fad1 must write a letter
to his father and ask for his guidance. As loving fathers do,
he sent Fad1 money, a horse and a servant and advised him to go
to the holy cities of Karbila and Najaf, the center of Islamic
theological schools which are located in Iraq for higher education.

He went through the capital city of Tehran and since the summer
season was approaching, he decided to spend the summer in Tehran
and then proceed toward the holy cities before fall.   Being thirsty
for knowledge, he attended theological classes in Tehran.
A teacher, who was also the president of the school, soon discovered
Fadl's depth and talent. Before long Fad1 became his favorite
student. This did not please the more established students who
felt displaced by this newcomer.

The timing of this was in 1852 when an attempt was made on the
life of the king by a few crazy Babi youth avenging the execution
of the Bab two years earlier.    This resulted in the Babis, high
and low, being rounded up and killed.  As you recall, that attempt
was the reason that Baha'u'llah, a widely-known well-respected
nobleman, was cast into the Siyah-Chal, being accused of
masterminding that attempt.    In those days of terror, the least

suspicion was enough reason for arrest and execution.     Jails and
prisons were only holding places before execution.

Well, the jealous students used the very handy weapon, accusing
Fad1 of being a Babi. Soon he was arrested and taken to the house

-
of notorious Mahmud-Khan-i-Kalantar,    the mayor of Tehran, for
questioning, torture, and you know what. The name of the mayor
should be familiar to you if you have heard the story of Tahirih.
Tahirih spent four years in that house and was martyred in the
same year, 1852.     You might wonder how they could keep so many
people in the mayor's or police chief's houses when they, with
their families, occupied them. Even a four bedroom house could
not accomodate all of that. Maybe a house with a basement? No,
even that wouldn't do it. The residences of these officials were
immense complexes including multiple buildings and numerous
attendants and servants for anything from bringing a glass of water
to a pampered child or torturing the people in confinement.

Fad1 was taken to a room where an older man, possibly a real Babi,
was also kept. The screaming they heard indicated some being
tortured. The fiendish mayor, after attending the torture, came
and sat in a room across from Fadl's room. Without being summoned,
Fad1 walked to that room and tried to convince the mayor that he
was not a Babi and had nothing to do with that religion. All fell
on deaf ears. So he decided to put his fate into the mysterious
hand of destiny, and what a mighty hand it proved to be!      Wait
and see.

When Fad1 was first arrested, he managed to send a message to his
teacher, the principal, about what was happening to him. All of
a sudden, the secretary of the principal rushed to the mayor and
handed him a note. You should have seen the 180 degree change
in attitude. A beast turned into a human. Pleasantly, the mayor
told Fadl, "Apparently the honorable principal expects you, so
may I ask that, without any delay, you go and see him."    The mayor
got up and, as a sign of respect, followed Fad1 to the door.

Fad1 continued to attend the classes in Tehran, but he had to cope
with another aggravating irritation. He became known by the divines
and their students as a Babi who was released through the inter-
vention of the principal. He became so well-known as a Babi that

even t h e laymen would p o i n t a t him, and t h e s t u d e n t s w h i l e walking
k e p t d i s t a n c e from him t o a v o i d d e f i l e m e n t of t h e i r r o b e s s h o u l d
it touch h i s .

Many of t h e s e r e l i g i o u s s c h o o l s had rooms f o r t h e s t u d e n t s t o s t a y .
I n one of t h e rooms i n t h a t s c h o o l where Fad1 s t a y e d , t h e r e was
a man c a l l e d S i y y i d Ya'aqtlb who s e c r e t l y was a Babi. L i k e F a d l ,
he a l s o was from t h e d i s t r i c t of Qa i n which brought them c l o s e r
together, particularly i n t h a t large city.

One of t h o s e summer n i g h t s of 1852, S i y y i d Ya'aqub, w e s h a l l r e f e r
t o him as S i y y i d , t o l d Fad1 j o k i n g l y ,        "Do you know t h a t you a r e
know a s a Babi?" Fad1 denied being a Babi and s a i d , " I have never
m e t a s i n g l e one of them o r r e a d a l i n e from t h e i r w r i t i n g s . "
I f o n l y h e c o u l d g u e s s what was i n s t o r e f o r him.              Siyyid s a i d ,
"Well, i t d o e s n o t make any d i f f e r e n c e , and by t h e way, I have
come a c r o s s some of t h e w r i t i n g s of t h e Bab which are t o o heavy
f o r me t o u n d e r s t a n d .      I t h o u g h t I s h o u l d b r i n g them t o you s o
w i t h your d e g r e e of l e a r n i n g you c o u l d e x p l a i n them t o me."           He
p l a c e d t h e p a p e r s on t h e t a b l e and l e f t .

Fad1 s t a t e s , "To p l e a s e t h e S i y y i d , I scanned t h e p a p e r s , b u t s i n c e
t h e y d i d n o t a p p e a r t o be i n my s t y l e , which was t h a t of

of my time, I h i d them under some books and p a p e r s s o no one would
f i n d such i n c r i m i n a t i n g material i n my room.

"The n e x t n i g h t S i y y i d came back.             I t o l d him I found them
w o r t h l e s s , and how I f e l t s o r r y f o r t h e f o o l i s h and g u l l i b l e who

m i s l e a d i n g t h e i n n o c e n t Muslims.
I'

Upon h e a r i n g my words, S i y y i d ' s f a c e showed h i s deep e m o t i o n a l
despair.         H e lowered h i s head. A f t e r a l o n g p a u s e , he r a i s e d h i s
head a few times as i f he were going t o s a y something b u t h e l d
i t back.         F i n a l l y on t h e way t o t h e d o o r , he r e c i t e d t h i s poem,
'How o f t e n knowledge and i n t e l l i g e n c e t u r n i n t o a monstrous t h i e f
robbing t h e w a y f a r e r . ' A s t h e f i n a l word, S i y y i d s a i d , 'Turn your
h e a r t t o t h e t r u t h i n t h e s e words' and l e f t .

Seeing him in that shape and hearing the poem and his final words
had an unusual effect on me. However, I concluded that he was
a Babi and was setting a trap for me, but did not realize the
cleverness of his intended quarry. His naive delusion to trap
me was pitifully ridiculous." The rendering of the poet states,
"Set your trap for another bird, 0 trapper, why? For I am the
phoenix and my nest is way up high."

The invisible trapper had His sight fixed on Fad1 and his
paradoxical trap of deliverance was firmly set. It was only a
matter of time. This phoenix was needed in the service of the
Cause. Yes, those mighty wings were destined to propel the Cause
of God and nothing else.

Fad1 continues to state, "Although Siyyid's mood and final words
had caused an internal turmoil in me, philosophically I decided
to dismiss it with logic. Well, why not. I felt with my knowledge
and intelligence I could find enough proofs within those papers
to save poor Siyyid from getting any deeper in his confusion.
He looked like a good man and should be brought back into the fold
of Islam.    My motivation was not to learn, but to find faults
to prove the fallacy of the Bab's claim.
It

With every line I read a new door of knowledge opened before my
eyes. Sleep escaped me and I was led into a new world. All night
I read the Bab's writings with increased enthusiasm discovering
gems previously hidden from me. The first rays of the sun found
my vision, my soul, and my heart totally changed and refreshed.

That evening the Siyyid came back. As soon as he learned what had
happened, he was overwhelmed and nearly went crazy. He prostrated
and in humility praised the Lord. Then if he was not crying, he
was laughing." Well! What do you expect? He had put the bait
for the phoenix, but the real trapper was the invisible power,
that inexplicable power of attraction to the Words of God.

From then on Siyyid could not supply him fast enough with other
writings of the Bab, one of which was what the Bab had revealed
for the matchless and erudite Vahid, the emissary of the king,
who instead of defeating the Bab, was captivated by Him and became
a staunch, dynamic, and dedicated follower.   Please do yourselves

a favor and learn about the history of the Bab, truly a divine
drama.

Now the sun had begun its descent, and day by day was setting lower.
With the approach of fall, it was time for Fad1 to oblige his
father's wishes. But who needed any further Islamic learning, having
discovered the real source of knowledge.

Fad1 decided to go on with the original plan and acquire all the
Islamic learning he could so no one could say "If he knew better,
he would not have become a Babi."

With his ability, why not aim for the highest degree of ijtihad
which is the doctorate degree of Islamic law.     Wouldn't you say
that it was a memorable summer for Fadl?    Well, the unforgettable
occasion is yet to come. Our phoenix is trapped but not yet tamed.

A new chapter in the life of this great man opens with his pursuit
of knowledge at the feet of well-known divines in Najaf and Karbila,
the two holy cities in Iraq.

Before opening the curtain to this stage, a timely digression is
worthwhile, one historical and one mystical.

It staggers one's mind to know that in the blood-bath of Tehran
in 1852, when the cross-fire of gory persecutions was mowing down
the Babis, there were some who actually dared to proclaim themselves
as new believers. Couldn't they wait until the danger was over?
No, not those who found the truth and saw its dazzle with their
spiritual eyes. Fad1 was not alone.      Another noteworthy person,
who already was a mujtahid, declared his belief in that year.
His title, given by Baha'u'llah, was Zaynu'l-Muqaribin, meaning
the ornament of the intimate ones. He was the most meticulous
transcriber who complied the Questions and Answers part of the
Kitab-i-Aqdas.   An unshakeable conviction does not pay attention
to the fear of persecution or death or any other obstacle, such
as disapproval £;om family and friends. L& us pray that all of
us attain such a certitude.

Where were we? Did I really tell you that it was Fad1 who decided
to proceed to the holy cities for furthering his education, or

was it his father who had advised him to do so. Well, maybe it
was himself, maybe his father, maybe both, and again, maybe neither.
Are you slightly confused,or am I?

Let us think of a child who has never seen a magnet which is setting
on the table. While playing with paperclips, one of them gets
close enough to the magnet and jumps to the magnet. The child
might think that the paperclip decided to move and stick to the
magnet. There are similar mysteries in this world and the worlds
beyond which are beyond our comprehension. That power, that force
is unfathomable. Wasn't it the same force which, some years later,
attracted    to Baha'u'llah    the seventeen-year-old    Badi, the
martyr-messenger who took Baha'u'llah's     tablet to the king of
Persia? Superficially, it appeared that he and his father had
made plans to make the long, dangerous, and difficult journey to
attain the presence of Baha'u'llah, but who knows. Coincidentally,
Badi and his father were from the same province of Khurasan blessed
by the footsteps of Quddus and Mulla Husayn. ~0th-~adl and later
Badi, like many others, were chosen and drawn to the magnet of
Baha'u'llah's attraction to be recreated and magnetized.

We should not think that now in Baha'u'llah's physical absence
such transformation is no more possible.       The glory which was
concealed within the Holy Being of Baha'u'llah is even more present.
What is asked of us is purity of motive, humility, and submission.
He works wonders if only we take the first step. You may have
experienced or witnessed such transformation which astonishes even
the person who has undergone such a transformation.

If Fad1 gave any thought to what we just discussed or not, we don't
know, but we know with certainty that he safely arrived at the
cities which were the center of Islamic learning.

He sat at the feet of prominent Islamic divines, the greatest of
whom was no less a person than -   - Murtida-i-Ansari. This great
man of learning and wisdom, praised by both Baha'u'llah and
Abdu'l-Baha, had such exacting and strict standards that he rarely
bestowed the title of mujtahid on any one. The six years which
it took for Fad1 to graduate was much less than the time it took
for others.
For his final dissertation in answer to some questions asked by

- Murtida, Fad1 wrote a book of a few thousand verses. -
-                                                             Shaykh

-
Murtida wrote on the margin of that book his astonishment and praise
for Fadlls depth and degree of knowledge. Fadl's diploma was signed
by this leading Mujtahid of Shi'ih Islam. When jealous students
of theology showed dismay about'the -    - having given the highest

Shaykh
degree to a person who was a Babi, he told them you write a similar
book and you shall receive my signature. You might be interested
to learn that only two other students received such a degree from
Shaykh
-   - Murtida. One was Mirza-i-Shirazi, who became the successor
to the -    - as the leading mujtahid, but as you may remelnber
from the talk on the Kitab-i-Aqdas, he was secretly a believer
in both the Bab and Baha'u'llah.     The third person receiving the
degree of ijtihad from the a a y k died while traveling in Arabia.
Doesn't it tell us something; that two of the three prize students
of such an honorable divine were believers in the Baha'i Faith.

Should time permit at the end of this talk we shall audit the assets
of -    - Murtida and Fad1 when they died compared to the other
greedy mujtahids.

One wonders how Fad1 felt after receiving the highest honor.
We have a well-decorated mujtahid fully aware of his own genius.
Being in such a position is challenging and dangerous. Our tests
grow harder with our growth.   It is exactly like the air resistance
which a moving object confronts. The faster it goes, the more
resistance and listen to this, the higher it goes, the more dramatic
becomes its fall. By remembering this analogy, we could always
be reminded about such an equation.     Forewarning about tests and
dangers is a good protection. The only problem is sometimes we
don't realize that we are being tested.      It is so easy to pass
the test if only we do our homework and read the guide book offered
to us by Baha'u'llah, the Redeemer of mankind.     One thing is for
sure, and that is Baha'u'llah's assurance that we will never be
tested beyond our capacity.

What would you do if you      were in the place of Fadl?     Well, go
home, but of course, being     so close to Karbila who would miss the
last opportunity of a visit   to the holy Shrine of Imam Husayn there.
The year was 1858, five       years before Baha'u'llah's declaration
in Ba&dad.

While in Karbila, Fad1 met a Persian Babi there. Fad1 states,
"This believer gave me all of the news and he made frequent
references about the exiled Babis in Ba&dad,     fifty miles away.
This, of course, meant Baha'u'llah and other Babis.     He insisted
that I must pay them a visit before returning to Iran or I might
regret it forever.    His praise of Jinab-i-Baha (as Baha'u'llah
used to be called in those days) had no bounds but when asked about
Mirza Yahya, the younger half-brother of Baha'u'llah who was
nominated by the Bab as the temporary head of the Babis, he became
subdued and stayed quiet. To make it short, he begged and made
me swear that when passing through Ba&dad,          I would visit
Baha'u'llah.

The unfoldment of the following events in the life of Fad1 could
be considered the highlight of this story, and that is the taming
of the phoenix who roams around head and shoulders above every
one else.

Don't you wish you could open the window wide by yourself without
me slowing you with digressions? My purpose is to guide you through
some passages of history, hoping that you will consider the history
of our precious Faith interesting, exciting, and inspiring. Then
you can be on your own, opening window after window through the
pages of the books decorating your shelves.

As requested by that Babi in Karbila, Fadl, while passing through
Ba&dad   on his way home, stopped over at Baha'u'llah's house.
It was in the afternoon when he entered a house which for ages
will be the center of circumambulation by the lovers of Baharu'llah
in obedience to the law of obligatory pilgrimage.

After a few minutes, Baha'u'llah came out from the private quarters
of the house to meet the visitor, Fadl. In that celebrated hall
which witnessed so much history, Baha'u'llah greeted Fadl, extending
a warm welcome to him. Then smilingly told him, "Don't you know
that in the eyes of the government of Iran We are considered to
be the enemy of the state and therefore have been cast out? People,
too, regard Us as outlaws and shun Us. You are a learned man,
a mujtahid who is highly respected. Whoever comes to meet Us and
associates with Us is labelled the same. How, then, did you dare
to come to Us, not sparing your position and status?" Then very

kindly, Baha'u'llah invited Fad1 to stay at His house as His guest.

He instructed His secretary, Mirza Aqa Jan, to look after Fadl's
comfort.

Fad1 states, "One day in Baha'u'llah's house, I was visiting with
Mulla Sadiq-i-Muqaddas, a very dignified and distinguished follower
of the Bab. Baha'u'llah, accompanied by a Persian prince, also
an exile, entered the house and came straight to us.    Mulla Sadiq
jumped out of his chair and threw himself at Baha'u'llah's feet.
Baha'u'llah disapprovingly told him, "Mulla, stand up and stop
these old practices," and immediately left with the prince. Fad1
states, "I could not believe my eyes. Somewhat stunned and upset,
I decided to give him a piece of my mind, seeing how Baha'u'llah
had admonished him."    For your information, Mulla Sadiq is the
same man who converted the celebrated Ahmad.     Listen to Ahmad's
story. It is quite touching.

Fad1 goes on to state, "I said, Mulla Sadiq, you not only are of
the learned but also occupy the exalted position of having been
appointed by His holiness the Bab as a witness, which ranks second
to the Letters of the Living. There is no question that Baha'u'llah
is a respectable man of nobility, and we know that on account of
His being a Babi. He was cast into the Siyah-aal, His belongings
were ransacked, and He was then exiled to this city.        None of
this justifies that a person of your caliber should act as a slave
at the feet of his master.    Mulla Sadiq refrained from answering
me. He was in another world. Beaming with joy, he said, 'I beg
God to tear the veils away from your eyes and shower you with His
abundant grace.'

\[11\] This answer puzzled me more than his action which I could not
figure out. I was prompted to closely observe the person of
Baha'u'llah,  His words and deeds.      I secretly began my own
research." Imagine the paper clip researching the magnet, oblivious
of its invisible force.

Well, there was nothing wrong with his research. After all,
independent investigation of truth is a teaching of Baha'u'llah.
But listen to this outlandish remark. Apparently, the phoenix
is swelling with pride by the minute waiting for something to
happen. Like what? Possibly like an overexpanded balloon? Pop?
No, this is the undying phoenix!

Fad1 continues his story, "The more I concentrated on Baha'u'llah,
the less I found anything significant to impress me. He was the
embodiment of humility and self-effacement. Nothing pointed to
His claiming any station. That grievous delusion led me to consider
myself in every way superior to Baha'u'llah. This proud attitude
was inflated by the respectful attitude of Baha'u'llah and others.
In all gatherings I occupied the seat of honor and when speaking,
would not give a chance to anyone, including Baha'u'llah, to utter
a word. "

So far our phoenix is having fun, but the hour of taming is drawing
closer. None of us enjoy the thought of such a great being turning
to ashes, but that is the only way to be recreated.

One unforgettable afternoon, something drastic happened. A fire?
No, not a visible one, let us go to the words of Fadl, himself,
"On that afternoon in the same hall where the gatherings used to
be held, under the instruction of Baha'u'llah, a large gathering
was held. As usual, I sat in the seat of honor and Baha'u'llah
sat in the middle of the crowd pouring tea with His own hands."

Oh, what a sight! Don't you wish you could have just one drop of
that tea?
I'

A question was asked and every one was quiet, so I was satisfied
that no one in the room was capable of answering it. I began my
usual discourse with everyone quietly absorbing every word except
Baha'u'llah.  He, at times while agreeing with my statement, added
further explanation. Gradually, He increased His explanation until
He took over and I became silent."

Well, friends! This is that long-awaited moment. That electrifying
sight when the phoenix consumes itself into ashes so he can be
recreated into that beautiful being deserving to be called by the
Blessed Beauty with these affectionate words "0 my Nabil." (Tablets
of Baha'u'llah, p. 151)

You    see, such a state of utter selflessness and nothingness is
the   absolute requirement at the end of the valley of search before
one   could step into the realm of unshakeable certitude. Such was
the   state of the greatest scholar, Mirza Abu'l-Fad1 when he embraced

the Cause, and such was the state of the raindrop in our story
before the ocean embraced it. As was said before, Fad1 was one
of the guiding stars when Mirza Abu'l-Fad1 was treading the valley
of search.

Back to the awesome scene of immolation and Fadl's own words, "When
I heard the outpouring of His profound words and surging of the
ocean of His utterance, I was dumbfounded. I was filled with awe,
fear, and shame for having occupied the seat of honor and went
into a state of fainting to the point that I could no longer hear
Baha'u'llah.  I was so ashamed that I wished to run out, but like
a sparrow in the claws of a mighty falcon, I could not make a move.
I was waiting for Him to finish His utterance, but I could not
hear Him. When His blessed lips stopped moving, I dashed out,
and in remorse hit my head three times against the wall for my
blindness."

By witnessing that glimpse of Baha'u'llah's might and glory, he
realized that Mulla Sadiq's prostrating at the feet of Baha'u'llah
was well justifiable.
Fad1 had two obstacles to deal with.    The worst was self and ego
and the next was the question of rank among the Babis.   The first
was conquered through Baha'u'llah's   mercy, but the question of
Mirza Yahya's position perplexed his analytical mind.  He overcame
this frustration by philosophically concluding that Mirza Yahya,
the nominee of the Bab, was in charge of day-to-day affairs of
the Faith, but Baha'u'llah was the spiritual leader and source
of innate knowledge.

Before long, at the home of a believer, Fad1 was also present when
Baha'u'llah revealed words about the mysteries and the origin of
creation. This made the words of all scholars appear to Fad1 like
the talk of children. It was not the nature of this great man,
Fadl, to be overcome by anxiety. He always could reason himself
out of it, but not this time.      He being was shaken to the core.
Every minute of those anxiety-ridden days seemed like eternity.
Every time he tried to soar on the wings of knowledge and logic,
an invisible force would direct him down to earth.              Such
instability became unbearable, so with utmost humility, Fad1 wrote
a letter to Baha'u'llah and requested   Abdu'l-Baha, at that time

an adolescent, to present it to Baha'u'llah.    In the letter, Fad1

begged Baha'u'llah to reveal His position.

In answer, Baha'u'llah revealed a tablet which began with utter
humility. In the middle, He touched upon Irfanic or Illuminati
subjects which were familiar to Fadl, and at the end, He expounded
on His own exalted station. This tablet was taken to Fad1 by

Abdu'l-Baha who instructed him to read it and return it to
Baha'u'llah.

The mighty phoenix soared to the pinnacle of certitude, achieving
immortality. Abdu'l-Baha's words verify this. You will hear them
at the end of this talk. His true mission in life began. May
all of us learn what is our real purpose and calling. Definitely
it is not mundane fame and wealth.     Meditate on it. Baha'u'llah
calls each one of us the immortal phoenix in this passage from
The Hidden Words and illminates our mission, ''0 Immortal Phoenix!
Dwell not save on the mount of faithfulness. Therein is thy
habitation, if on the wings of thy soul thou soarest to the realm
of the infinite and seekest to obtain thy goal." (HW p. 22)

It wouldn't be fair to you not to recount an interesting story
related by Fad1 about events while he was a guest of Baha'u'llah.
He states, "One day I was sitting on my knees at the presence of
Baha'u'llah when an agent of the Muslim divines in the holy cities
arrived. His name was Mulla Hasani-Amu. He knew me quite well.
He had come there on behalf of the doctors of Islam to ask
Baha'u'llah to perform a miracle as a proof of His powers."

Fad1 goes on to state, "Mulla was dumbfounded to find me sitting
at the feet of Baha'u'llah. He sat down and gradually moved closer
to me and whispered in my ear, 'What is a personage of your eminence
doing here?' I whispered back in his ears, 'I am here for the
same reason that you are. "' Both were seeking the truth, but in
different ways.

Now we turn the page to a new chapter in the life of Fadl-i-Qaini
who was later given the title of Nabil-i-Akbar by Baha'u'llah.
Upon his return to his hometown a large number of divines, students
and merchants went a distance in advance to welcome the great
mujtahid home. The Amir or ruler of the district of Qa in

personally welcomed him with generous words of praise. Matter
of fact, he invited Fad1 to be his guest twice a week and to teach
him philosophy.

The divines and the students who had heard all about his fame and
degree of ijtihad secretly planned to test him. They chose the
most learned among them for the task. He reported back that Fadl's
knowledge was superior. One thing after another made him ascend
the ladder of prestige and popularity quite fast--but to our dismay,
this did not last long due to two elements.

One was the jealousy of the established ecclesiastics who found
themselves displaced by Fadl, and the second one obviously was
his teaching the Faith. Although he used his discretion in choosing
the receptive souls, it didn't work out that way. With his charisma
and knowledge, converting people was no problem. One of the many
Muslims he converted was a preacher and a relative of Fadl.

One day when this relative was giving a sermon, he intermingled
some new verses which the listeners were not familiar with. If
you like to see an uproar of disapproval, you should have been
there. The large crowd interrupted his sermon with shouts of "What
are these words?"     Quite frightened and not thinking of the
consequences, he said, "These are not my words. I heard them from
Fadl." Well, that was it. The clergy who were badly waiting for
the opportunity to strike were supplied with ammunition against
Fadl. They poisoned the goodwill of the ruler who used to see
Fad1 twice a week to the point that the fickle ruler decided to
arrest, chastise, and imprison Fadl. What an intriguing world.

At that time Fad1 was in his early thirties and was engaged to
a fine young lady from a nearby village. No doubt she was the
envy of many women her age.         After all, Fadl's good looks
complemented his other unmatched qualities. It is yet too early
to think of the biggest wedding in that corner of the world.

One day when he was returning from that village, before reaching
his hometown, the agents of the Amir intercepted him and showed
him the order of the Amir, the same ruler who used to have Fad1
come twice a week to teach him philosophy.    He was ordered to
dismount his horse. The agents removed his boots and filled them

with gravel and hung the boots around his neck. Barefoot, he
covered the distance back to the village over thistles and rough
ground. There he was thrown into a prison where he was denied
water and food. This period of suffering from inadequate food
and water lasted about two months. Then with stocks on his feet,
which are heavy blocks of wood locked around the ankles, he was
taken to Birjand, a city in that province. There he was confined
in the house of the police chief. I think that was the end of
that engagement for Fadl. Maybe he will have better luck next
time.
That inhumane treatment of Fad1 should be followed by a refreshing
incident, but all of us may wonder about the purpose of tests and
difficulties which most of us have experienced or witnessed. There
are many passages in the Baha'i writings about their purpose and
significance.   They definitely make us stronger with a cleansing
and mellowing effect, the way the earth is torn by the plow clearing
thistles and rocks. Some may become bitter and resentful.       What
tests and tribulations do for our soul could be explained as
precisely as the soul itself. Limited human understandin-g is
incapable of comprehending the infinite, the world to which the
soul belongs.

Now the delightful story which was related by the son of the police
chief of Birjand.    He states, "Before Fad1 was brought to our
house, one night my mother saw in her dream that the sun descended
from the sky right into our house and set in a corner of a certain
room. The next day Fad1 was brought for confinement in our house.
When my mother looked through the window, she saw Fad1 sitting
exactly in the same corner where she saw the sun set in her dream.
She realized the importance of the stranger and treated him with
reverence."   You see, Baha'u'llah did not forsake His chosen
servant.

There, in Birjand, the authorities decided to return Fad1 to his
hometown hoping that he would keep a low profile. Fad1 planned
to settle there, and built a house which was still in existence
at the time of the writing of the history book Masabih-i-Hidayat
in 1946. We don't know what the present regime has done to it.
Since the writer of the history bdok reported that the house was
in the hand of non-Baha'is, there is some hope that it may be

preserved, as mainly Baha'i properties were destroyed by the present
fanatic regime in Iran.

The culprit for all of this mischief was an influential man called
Abu-Talib who was a bitter enemy of Fadl.    Not tolerant of Fadl's
presence in his small hometown, he caused the government agents
from the provincial capital of Mashad to come and take Fad1 back
to Mashad. As depraved as ~ b u - ~ x i was,

b     he bribed the agents
to torture Fad1 on their way to Mahad.         Again, the hand of
providence was at work. The governor general, as expected, was
a prince but had exceptionally good character.     He received Fad1
with respect and gave him protection from the enemies.        There
Fad1 wrote a book called Hesamiyih which hopefully some day will
be found. A dignitary close to the governor also became captivated
by Fadl's charisma and qualities and arranged for a handsome annual
allowance for him.     With honor he was encouraged to return to
his district of Qa'in. One would think that with such honorable
treatment, smooth sailing should follow. But ruthless is the word
for many enemies of the Faith who have hounded the innocent
believers even to these recent years.

The wretched Abu-Talib sent complaint after complaint to Tehran,
and did not rest until the king's agent came and took Fad1 to
Tehran. The ups and downs of this story were not arranged for
the sake of story telling but are in the order they occured.
Well, to your and my surprise, in Tehran they set him free. This
was in 1869. (Eminent Baha'is in the Time of Baha'u'llah, p. 114)

Of course.    What else?     He became the light and source of
inspiration in every Baha'i gathering in that large city. Oh,
how badly this narrator wishes he could hear one of Fadl's speeches.
By many accounts, his speech would galvanize everyone in the
audience. Before speaking, he used to look intently into the eyes
of the individuals in attendance as if reading their souls and
establishing a strong connection.

It is timely to mention some of the strict principles which Fad1
observed personally and stressed to others.

1\. Speech is by itself an action and every action will leave a
permanent effect in both this world and the next. Therefore, our

speech, even when joking, must be guarded as much as our deeds.

> 2. On quoting a source, one must always acknowledge the source
> or it will be an act of stealing.
> 3. When presenting a subject, should one realize he has made a
> mistake, he should not hesitate to correct it. Should someone
,   in the audience correct the mistake, one should gracefully stand

> corrected with humility and joy. We should be grateful when someone
> reminds us of our true nature, which is imperfection.

> Finally, he stressed over and over that dissemination of wrong
> information, by all means, must be avoided, advice which has been
> the goal in this series of tapes, but who can claim perfection?.
> May we all continue to adhere to this advice in all of our speeches,
> writings, and other endeavors.

> Soon Fadl's fame spread, and the large city of Tehran became too
> small for him. The clergy became agitated and the usual course
> of events followed. His stay in Tehran lasted three and a half
> years. He got married in Tehran but it was short-lived. Two of
> the greatest clergy of Tehran had plotted to assasinate Fadl, so,
> as a disguise, he discarded his turban and put on civilian hat
> which is shown in his photograph.   Under the order of the king,
> the police were searching for him everywhere, but without luck.
> Frustrated, they arrested Fadl's fifteen year old brother-in-law
> and tortured him to reveal Fadl's whereabouts which he did not
> know. Fad1 moved from house to house.     When he was told by an
> informant that the noose was getting tighter and trapping was at
> hand, he decided to leave Tehran. This was only one month after
> his marriage.

> Under disguise, he left Tehran to face never-ending trials and
> difficulties which was the lot of all dedicated servants of
> Baha'u'llah.   His reward was permission to attain the presence
> of Baha'u'llah, now in Akka, confined in the house of Abbud. The
> year was 1873, that memorable year. In that year, that house
> witnessed the revelation of the Kitab-i-Aqdas,      Abdu'l-Baha's
> wedding, and the revelation of the momentous Tablet of Wisdom in
> honor of Fadl.     Baha'u'llah honored him with the title of
> Nabil-i-Akbar, Nabil meaning noble and learned, and Akbar meaning
> great. The Tablet of Wisdom will be briefly discussed at the end
> of this talk.
With heavy heart, he said farewell to those unforgettable days
and with refreshed spirit returned to Iran.      He crisscrossed the
country, edifying the believers and teaching the non-believers.

He went to Tehran and spent some years in Qazvin where he got
married for the second time.  His only child, a daughter, married
Fadl's nephew, who was very close to him, and has given most of
the accounts of this story.

The enemies never stopped looking for Fadl. Sometimes they would
send advance notices to his next possible stopping-place. Now
he had become so well-known that he stated the whole country became
too small for him.

Finally a major complaint was filed against Fadl, and the king
issued the order for his arrest and transfer to Tehran for
execution. His age at that time was about 62.

The governor-general of the province of Khurasan was notified about
Fadl's probable escape to that corner of the country, as it was
his home territory. The governor sent notices to all of the mayors
and rulers to be on the lookout for Fadl. This was not the previous
governor in whose protection Fad1 wrote a book, but we shall see
if he was as princely as the former governor. Now spies were posted
everywhere.

The following story is related by Fadl's nephew, who was also his
son-in-law and accompanied him. His name was Aqa -       - Muhammad
Ali, and he was also a distinguished believer. The nephew states,
1'

Fad1 and I were approaching Sabzivar (the city where he received
his education in philosophy), when we decided not to enter the
city in order to avoid recognition. Therefore we went to a
caravanserai and lodged in a room. Our disguise in civilian
clothing had worked so far. However, at midnight an agent came
and told my uncle, 'You are Fadl, and I am ordered to take you
to the governor.'

The governor was sitting at his desk, expecting Fadl. As he entered
the room, the governor raised his head and gazed at him for a while
without uttering a word. Then he said, "Without a doubt, you are
the celebrated Fadl.' Fad1 remained silent.       With anger in his

voice, the governor said, 'I know Mirza Husayn- Ali from Nur
(meaning Baha'u'llah).   I cannot fathom a person as great as you
giving your allegiance to Him. You received your education in
this very city, impressing your teacher, the greatest philosopher,
Mulla Hadi. You received your degree of ijtahid from no less a
person than -     - Murtida-i-Ansari.

Shaykh                     Aren't you ashamed to be
a follower of Mirza Husayn- Ali?      It is truly a mockery beyond
compare. I wish you had declared yourself to be a prophet. Come
on and have mercy and relieve yourself from such unworthy burden.'

Fad1 responded in these words, 'Your highness knows that it is
a natural instinct for everyone to want to be respected,
particularly the higher class and the learned. I was no exception
to the rule. When I met Baha'u'llah for the first time I considered
myself way superior to Him, but in the course of events when I
heard His outpouring of gem-like utterances, I was convinced that
He was the ocean and I was but a lowly drop.      I find myself to
be a helpless bird in the claws of the mighty falcon.      He rules
my heart and my soul. This is my confession. Do with me what
you have to do. Kill me on the spot, put me in chains and stocks,
or transfer me to Tehran for execution."'
'1

The prince governor was really moved by such sincere and bold
declaration. His face could not hide his emotion. He said with
quivering voice, 'I detest to see any harm done to you. I shall
pretend that I have never seen you. For heaven's sake, leave the
city at once and be extremely careful because spies are posted
everywhere. ' "  Doesn't this just stagger your imagination? No
one could resist the force of Fadl's personality.

Fad1 returned to    the caravanserai and related to his nephew what
had transpired.     They wasted no time. Before dawn they were on
their way, using    the side roads. They headed for a town where its
ruler was a very     close friend of Fadl. Gracious hospitality was
extended to both    Fad1 and his nephew who needed some rest before
the next surprise   in the life of Fadl.

They bought two donkeys and headed for the Russian border aiming
for Ishqabad, a sanctuary for many persecuted Persian Baha'is.
There w a s only one problem which was not so minor. Neither had
a passport and the border was only a short distance away.

Fad1 said, "Baha'u'llah has always come to my assistance. We shall
rely upon Him again." No doubt with Fadl's past experiences, he
could almost see the Hand of Providence. Fad1 said, "Let us
dismount our donkeys and walk ahead of them. In such situations
I usually chant a prayer from the Bab." That worked like magic.
As they walked through the Persian section of the customs, the
chief was standing talking to his staff.      As the two passed by
them, the chief greeted Fad1 and offered them tea, which Fad1 did
not accept, pretending he was in a rush. They also passed through
the Russian customs without anyone demanding to see their documents.
They arrived in Ishqabad with no further trouble. The year was
1892\. There, F a d l enjoyed reunion with the celebrated Mirza
Abu'l-Fad1 who had moved there a few years earlier. What a bounty
for the people of Ishqabad to have two of the greatest luminaries
of the Faith among them.

One story about Fad1 during his stay in Ishqabad makes me very
sad and makes me wonder if I ever have been guilty of such a
neglect.

Fad1 enriched everyone in that city by his knowledge, but he had
no income and was living in poverty. He was too dignified to ask
for assistance. A believer from Ishqabad relates the following
sad story: "One night I invited ~ a d lfor dinner. Before dinner
was served, I saw Fad1 picking up a dry piece of bread in the corner
of the room and, with a sigh, began to eat it. I learned that
Fad1 had not eaten a few meals."     Apparently he was overcome by
the aroma of the delicious meal being prepared and could not fight
his hunger any longer. Just think!        During the Fast we miss
only one meal and feel starved by sunset. How about missing a
few meals ? This is a lesson to us to always be aware of the needs
of others.

You know, in the story of Mirza Abu'l-Fadl, similarly it is
mentioned that a meal consisting of a dry piece of bread dipped
in water was no stranger to that great scholar.

With their capacity and knowledge, how much wealth and fame could
have been theirs had they stayed Muslim, but they chose the Faith
of Baha'u'llah.
After a while, accompanied by Mirza Abu'l-Fadl, Fadl-i-Qa ini moved

-
to Bukhara in the province of Uzbakistan, north of Afghanistan.

In a short time, Fad1 became ill and on July 6, 1892, five weeks
after the Ascension of Baha'u'llah, he passed way at the age of
63\. After more than thirty years of dedicated service, the immortal
phoenix winged his flight in the wake of the Ascension of his Lord
to the realm of eternity.     He died penniless, far, far away from
his home and family. Abdu'l-Baha conferred upon him the title
of Hand of the Cause posthumously.

Abdu'l-Baha honored him with a tablet of visitation and instructed
the local Assembly of Ishqabad to have nine people visit his resting
place on the anniversary of Fadl's passing and chant that tablet
as it would attract the bounties of God. For twenty years, the
believers visited that spot. When Fadl's nephew attained the
presence of Abdu'l-Baha, he was instructed to transfer Fadl's
remains to IGqabad. This was done in 1923 and soon the wisdom
of it became apparent. The cemetary in Bukhara-      was leveled by
order of the government.

The Tablet of Wisdom, or Lawh-i-Hikmat, was revealed by Baha'u'llah
in honor of Fad1 in 1873. The English translation, which you are
urged to read, is in the book called Tablets of Baha'u'llah.      It
was revealed in rich Arabic language in the style familiar to Fadl,
who was a great philosopher. Much of the following description
is extracted from The Revelation of Baha'u'llah, Volume 4 by Mr.
Adib Taherzadeh, and in parts directly quoted. (pp. 33-49)

In another tablet, Baha'u'llah states that in each verse of The
Tablet of Wisdom an ocean is concealed.      The Tablet of Wisdom
is distinct from other tablets of Baha'u'llah for its philosophical
terminology, its reference to Greek philosophers, praising Socrates
as the father of philosophy and the most distinguished.       Among
many other topics, He describes the influence of the Word of God,
as well as the cause and origin of creation and refers to the
mysterious workings of nature.

In that tablet, Baha'u'llah affectionately calls Fad1 " 0 My Nabil,"
which must have balmed the wounds he suffered in the path of his
Lord. Then comes the following celebrated passage revealed fifteen

years after that memorable day when Fad1 suddenly recognized
Baha'u'llah's superior knowledge. It is possibly in answer to
Fadl's question or curiosity as to how Baha'u'llah attained
omniscience. Don't we all want to know ?

"Thou knowest full well that We perused not the books which men
possess, and we acquired not the learning current amongst them,
and yet whenever We desired to quote the sayings of the learned
and the wise, presently there will appear before the face of thy
Lord in the form of a tablet all that which hath appeared in the
world and is revealed in the Holy Books and Scriptures. Thus do
We set down in writing that which the eye perceiveth. Verily,
His knowledge encompasses the earth and the heavens. This is a
Tablet wherein the Pen of the Unseen hath inscribed the knowledge
of all that hath been and shall be - a knowledge that none other
but my wondrous Tongue can interpret."

To close this window, no words could be more befitting to honor
this Hand of the Cause and Apostle of Baha'u'llah than this tribute
from Abdu'l-Baha in Memorials of the Faithful (pp. 1-5)

"Because he stood steadfast in this holy Faith,

> because he guided souls and served this Cause
> and spread its fame, that star, Nabil, will shine
> forever from the horizons of the abiding light."
