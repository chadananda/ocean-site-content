     An Homage to Memorials of the
Faithful and to Eleven of Its Heroes

Julio Savi

Abstract

Memorials of the Faithful is described as an inspiring “book
of prototypes,” that not only portrays “all of the archetypes
that the various personality theorists have given us in this
century” and “all the human dichotomies” that we may find in
our lives, but also addresses “us in our time... [and] on our own
travels... [in our] tacit dimension, the silent root of human
life.” These features of the book have lead the author to
compose nine poems on eleven of the personages of the book:
Shaykh Salmán, Nabíl-i-Zarandí, Darvísh-i-Íidq-‘Alí, Shaykh
Íádiq-i-Yazdí, Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín Yazdí, Shaykh ‘Alí Akbar-i-
Mazgání, Óájí Ja‘far and his brothers, ‘Abdu’lláh Baghdádí and
Jináb-i-Muníb. They have not been chosen because they were
considered in any way superior to or better than all the others.
They were chosen because some of their personal qualities and
of the events in their lives raised louder echoes in the author’s
heart and mind. The nine poems are presented, with short
explanations of the details that have moved the author to write
them.

Memorials of the Faithful, first published in Persian in 1924

in Haifa by the publisher Ma†ba‘ah al-‘Abbásíyah, under the
title of Tadhkiratu’l-Vafá, is “the first Bahá’í book to be
printed in Haifa under the Guardianship” [Gail xi]. The word
Tadhkirat is a Persian-Arabic word. It derives from the Arabic
root dhakara, translated into English as “he preserved it in his
memory, he remembered it... he sought, or endeavoured, to
remember” [Lane 3:134]. The word Tadhkirat, usually translated
“memory, remembrance... biographical memory, biography”
[Steingass 290], is used in Arabic, Persian and Turkish literature to
denote literary works “concerned with the lives of poets...
calligraphers... or other categories of memorable persons”
[Heinrichs et al.]. One of the most famous of these works is a
book written by the well-known Persian poet Faríd ad-Dín
‘A††ár (c.1142–c.1220), Tadhkirat al-Awliyá, a collection of
hagiographies published in English under the title Memorial of
the Saints (see Muslim Saints and Mystics). Alessandro Bausani
(1921–1988) writes that this book “is similar... to our middle age
Little Flowers” [502]. Western literature is rich in similar books,
such as the Golden Legend (Latin: Legenda Aurea) by Jacobus de
Voragine (Italian: Jacopo da Varagine), a collection of lives of
the saints in Latin, probably compiled around 1260; Acts of the
Saints (Latin: Acta Sanctorum), an encyclopedic text in 68
volumes examining the lives of Christian saints, organized
according to each saint’s feast day, published between 1643 and
1940; and Alban Butler’s (1710–1773) The Lives of the Fathers,
Martyrs and Other Principal Saints, first published in 1756–
1759, a popular compendium of the Acts of the Saints in
English.

‘A††ár’s work, like the hagiographic literature of the Western
world, relates stories of miracles and portents ascribed to the
personages whose lives and utterances the author wishes to share
with his readers. And as a matter of fact he calls them Awliyá,
that literally means “Friends (of God),” but is commonly used to
denote the “saints” [Steingass 122]. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s work is
completely different. He celebrates His personages for their

vafá’, that is “good faith, fidelity, loyalty, sincerity” [Steingass
1475], a word which Shoghi Effendi has often translated
“faithfulness,” as for example in the following sentence from
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament:

> In these days, the most important of all things is the
> guidance of the nations and peoples of the world.
> Teaching the Cause is of utmost importance for it is the
> head corner-stone of the foundation itself. This wronged
> servant has spent his days and nights in promoting the
> Cause and urging the peoples to service. He rested not a
> moment, till the fame of the Cause of God was noised
> abroad in the world and the celestial strains from the
> Abhá Kingdom roused the East and the West. The
> beloved of God must also follow the same example. This
> is the secret of faithfulness (vafá’), this is the requirement
> of servitude to the Threshold of Bahá! [WT 10]

Marzieh Gail (1908–1993), an eminent Bahá’í author and
translator, who translated the book into English in 1969 under
the title Memorials of the Faithful, because she had received this
task from the Guardian himself, when she was “on a pilgrimage
to the Bahá’í world center in Haifa” [xi], writes that this work
“is more than the brief annals of early Bahá’í disciples... it is a
kind of testament of values endorsed and willed to us by the
Bahá’í Exemplar” [ibid.]. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s descriptions do not
point out the charismatic or thaumaturgical powers of His
personages. There are only three exceptions, three episodes of
persons healed through the intervention of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

Shaykh Íádiq-i-Yazdí recovers from an intestinal disorder
after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has done what Bahá’u’lláh has enjoined Him
to do: “Go... Place your hand on the distended area and speak
the words: ‘O Thou the Healer! [Yá Sháfí]’”1 [MF 43].
Mu˙ammad-Hádíy-i-Ṣa˙˙áf heals from a long-standing chronic
fever after having eaten a special food specifically prescribed by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá and two years later he dies after having eaten the
same food in different circumstances [see MF 68]. Mírzá Ja‘far-i-

280                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

Yazdí returns to life right after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has chanted at his
bedside by the command of Bahá’u’lláh “the prayer of Yá
Sháfí—O Thou, the Healer” [MF 157], while his “family were
gathered about him, mourning him, shedding bitter tears” [ibid.].
These three episodes are narrated as common episodes of
everyday life, without any emphasis on what appears to us as
exceptional events. A few years earlier ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had clearly
explained the meaning of miracles to the eminent American
Bahá’í Laura Clifford Barney (1979–1974). First: “The
Manifestations of God are sources of miraculous deeds and
marvelous signs. Any difficult or impossible matter is to Them
possible and permitted” [SAQ 113]. Second: “in the sight of the
Manifestations of God these marvels and miracles are of no
importance... they would constitute a clear evidence only for
those who were present when they took place, not for those
who were absent” [ibid.]. Third: “These outward miracles are of
no importance to the followers of truth... if a dead body be
revived, what is gained thereby, since it must die again? What is
important is to bestow true insight and everlasting life—that is,
a spiritual and divine life” [ibid. 115]. Faithful to this position,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá prefers to speak of the spiritual portents
performed by His personages: their faithfulness in applying the
divine Law to the actions of their daily lives, as difficult as their
circumstances may have been. It is their high moral standard
that makes of each of the personages of His book an example of
life to be recorded for posterity.

In Memorials of the Faithful ‘Abdu’l-Bahá presents 69

biographies, but in reality He speaks of 79 personages, because
in two cases He speaks of two believers together and in four
cases he speaks about groups of brothers. The believers that He
describes in the same biography are: Áqá Mírzá Mahmúd and
Áqá Ridá, “close and trusted companions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá” [MF
41], who, together, “devoted their days to all that is best in
human life: they had seeing eyes; they were mindful and aware;
they had hearing ears, and were fair of speech. Their sole desire
was to please Bahá’u’lláh. To them, nothing was a bounty at all,

Homage to Memorials of the Faithful                            281

except service at His Holy Threshold” [MF 40-1]; and Mashhadí
Ḥusayn e Mashhadí Mu˙ammad-i-Adhirbáyjání who, “both from
the province of Adhirbáyján” [MF 62], worked as farmers in
Bágh-i-Firdaws and died together because of the hot climate of
the region, to which “they were not accustomed” [MF 63]. The
groups of brothers are: Ustád Báqir and Ustád Ahmad, two
carpenters, who “from the time when both became believers
each held the other in His embrace” [MF 72]; Áqá Ibráhím-i-
Isfáhání and his three brothers, which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes
together although they lived apart from one another, perhaps
not only for their common love for Bahá’u’lláh, but also as a
homage to the early days of their earthly lives when “they all
lived in the same house, and remained together day and night.
Bird-like, they shared the one nest; and they were always fresh
and full of grace, like flowers in a bed” [MF 77]; Óájí Ja’far-i-
Tabrízí and his two brothers, “souls at rest... well-pleased with
their Lord and well-pleasing unto Him” [MF 125]; and finally Áqá
Mu˙ammad-Báqir and Áqá Mu˙ammad-Ismá‘íl, who “died on
the same night, wrapped in each other’s arms” [MF 169] and their
brother Pahlaván Ri∂á, who passed away far from them in
Káshán. Among these 79 personages there are also three women:
the consort of the King of Martyrs [MF 13-5], a Bahá’í beheaded
in Ißfáhán in 1879, Shamsu’∂-Îuhá [MF 175-90] and Ṭáhirih [MF
190-203].

Gail describes Memorials of the Faithful as “a book of
prototypes” [xi]. She advises her readers that they will meet
“mystic, feminist, cleric, artisan, merchant and prince... even
modern Western youth... for example, in the chapter on
Dervishes” [ibid.]. Ronald Frederick Price, a Bahá’í Canadian
writer and poet, guides us throughout the book so that we may
meet “all of the archetypes that the various personality theorists
have given us in this century” and “all the human dichotomies”
[Price 3]: “Jung’s introvert and extrovert... the artist, the
suffering artist-soul within us all, Mishkín-Qalam... [who]
survives in all his seriousness, as we might, with humour” [ibid.];
“the personality constitutionally weighted on the side of cheer,”

282                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 17

as for example Ismu’lláhu’l-Aṣdaq, who “always taught
cheerfully and with gaiety, and would respond gently and with
good humour” [MF 6]; or Mu˙ammad-‘Alí of Ißfáhán, “a boon
companion... affable... happy and content” [MF 24], loved by
everyone, who “spent his days in utter bliss” [MF 25] despite his
straitened circumstances; and the opposite personality “the
sombre, more reflective even melancholic type” [Price 3], often
as a “result of the many difficulties these lovers of Bahá’u’lláh
were subjected to and wore them ‘to the bone’” [ibid.; see MF 96],
like Mírzá Mihdí of Káshán, who “was ill almost all the time...
an outcast, and destitute,” but always patient and content [MF
96]; or Óájí Taqí who after the death of his two brothers,
“weary of this life” [MF 115-6], threw himself down from the
roof of his room, because he wanted to die; or Qulám-‘Alíy-i-
Najjár, a man “abstemious and chaste... a mild man, patient
quiet, mostly keeping to himself” [MF 142-3]. “Restlessness is a
dominant theme” [Price 3] in these biographies: Sháh
Mu˙ammad-Amín, “a flame of God’s love” [MF 45], “never
rested for a moment. Not one night did he spend on a bed of
ease, never did he lay down his head on comfort’s pillow. He
was continuously in flight, soaring as the birds do, running like
a deer” [MF 46]; Nabíl of Qá’in, “in ecstasy, burning up with
love” [MF 50], “restless as the waves of the sea” [MF 51], “had no
caution, no patience, no reserve; he cared nothing for reticence,
nothing for dissimulation” [MF 51]; Mírzá Mu˙ammad, after
Bahá’u’lláh’s ascension, “could not stay quiet, day or night...
[and] wasted away, like a candle burning down” [MF 107]. There
also are quiet personages who, like Mishkín-Qalam, had no
match “for patience and inner calm” [MF 101]; or who like Mírzá
Ja‘far-i-Yazdí, “a quiet man, sparing of speech” were “in all
things relying entirely upon God” [MF 157]. Finally, we meet
sociable believers, like Ḥají ‘Abdu’lláh Najaf-Abádí who “spent
his days in friendly association with the other believers” [MF 66-
7]; and Nabíl of Qá’in, whose society was “attractive” [MF 53].
But we also meet people who prefer solitude, like the two
brothers Ustád Báqir and Ustád A˙mad who lived “keeping to
themselves, away from friend and stranger alike” [MF 72-3]; or

Homage to Memorials of the Faithful                                283

Qulám-‘Alíy-i-Najjár, who “inclined to solitude, apt to stay
apart from friend and stranger alike... much of the time lived by
himself” [MF 144].

Both Gail and Price suggest that “the reader will probably
find himself in these pages” [Gail xi], because ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

> ... is describing not only the lives of these men and
> women in the nineteenth century, He is describing us in
> our time. He is addressing us on our own travels. He
> addresses the restlessness in us all. He speaks to us in our
> victory and our loss. He speaks about what Michael
> Polanyi [1891–1976] calls the tacit dimension, the silent
> root of human life, which is difficult to tap in
> biographies, the inner person. This private, this inner
> person, is the person he writes about for the most part.

[Price 3]

These are the features of this “series of spiritual portraits”
[Kazemzadeh] that have enabled me to write nine poems on eleven
personages whose life is described in it. I did not chose them
because I considered them in any way superior or better than all
the others. I chose them because some of their personal qualities
or events in their lives raised louder echoes in my heart and
mind.

Shaykh Salmán

Shaykh Salmán [see MF 13-6; see his photo in Taherzadeh, Revelation
1:206, Balyuzi, Eminent Bahá’ís 231] is well known by the Bahá’ís
because for almost 40 years, “from the year 69 2 until the
Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh” in 1892 [MF 15], and even later until
1898-1899 when he died in Shíráz, he went back and forth,
travelling thousands of miles, mostly on foot, to bring Tablets
and letters from the residences of Bahá’u’lláh and later of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Their lovers in Iran and ‘Iráq and vice versa.
For this reason the Blessed Beauty honored him with the title of
“Messenger of the Merciful (Payk-i-Ra˙mán)” [Revelation 1:109,

284                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 17

Nafa˙át 124]. He was admired for “his simple and unsophisticated
nature, his clear insight, his wisdom and tact when confronted
with dangerous or difficult situations, above all his faith in
Bahá’u’lláh,” as well as his “great physical stamina” [Revelation
1:110, 111]. Adib Taherzadeh (1921–2000), the author of a four
volume study of the life and Writings of the Founder of the
Bahá’í Faith, writes about him: “Salmán was pure-hearted and
very simple. The believers always enjoyed his company but there
were some friends in high positions who were embarrassed and
sometimes afraid to meet him because of his simplicity and
frankness” [Revelation 2:283]. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes his services:

> He traveled on foot, as a rule eating nothing but onions
> and bread; and in all that time, he moved about in such a
> way that he was never once held up and never once lost a
> letter or a Tablet. Every letter was safely delivered; every
> Tablet reached its intended recipient. Over and over
> again, in Ißfahán, he was subjected to severe trials, but
> he remained patient and thankful under all conditions,
> and earned from non-Bahá’ís the title of “the Bábís’
> Angel Gabriel.” [MF 15]

These words by the Master resonate in the following poem
[see Savi, Remoteness 270]:

> S HAYKH S ALMÁN
> Bologna, 1 February 1999

> Shaykh Salmán,
> Gabriel of the Bahá’ís,
> how many lands
> did you cross,
> how many cold
> nights, or sunned
> days on dusty
> roads did you spend.

> from the human Temple
> of the Beloved One,
> to the human hearts
> of His beloved ones.

Nabíl-i-A‘ ẓam

Mu˙ammad-i-Zarandí (1831–1892), known as Nabíl-i-A‘ẓam
[see MF 32-6; see his photo in Revelation 1:238],

has been defined by
Shoghi Effendi Bahá’u’lláh’s “Poet-Laureate, His chronicler and
His indefatigable disciple” [GPB 130]. His life is so well-known
among the Bahá’ís that it is not worth dwelling on it. The
episode that inspired my poem [see Remoteness 260-1] is described
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as follows: “And at the end, when the Daystar
of the world had set, he could endure no more, and flung
himself into the sea. The waters of sacrifice closed over him; he
was drowned, and he came, at last, to the Most High” [MF 35].
His own words about his early days also resonated in my heart
and mind:

> I was a shepherd by profession, and was given in my
> early days a most rudimentary education. I longed to
> devote more time to my studies, but was unable to do
> so, owing to the exigencies of my situation. I read the
> Qur’án with eagerness, committed several of its passages

Darvísh Íidq-‘Alí

Darvísh Íidq-‘Alí [see MF 36-8] is one of the nine individuals
described in Memorials of the Faithful as “belonging to the
mystic element (‘urafá)” [TV 63, MF 36]. ‘Urafá is the plural of
‘árif, ‘the highest grade to which a mystic can attain’ [Steingass
829]. They are: Nabíl-i Akbar, Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar, Mu˙ammad-
‘Alí from Ißfáhán, Darvísh Íidq-‘Alí, Óájí Mu˙ammad Khán,
Mishkín-Qalam, Óájí Áqáy-i Tabrízí, Mírzá Muß†afá and
Shams-i Îu˙á.

Nabíl-i Akbar excelled in “the teachings of the mystics
(‘urafá) and of the Shaykhí School” [TV 5, MF 1]; Mullá ‘Alí-
Akbar “frequented the gatherings of... mystics (‘urafá)...
thoughtfully traversing those areas of knowledge (‘ilm),3
intuitive wisdom (‘irfán),4 and illumination (ishráq)”5 (TV 19, MF
9]; Mu˙ammad-‘Alí from Ißfáhán “was one of the mystics
(‘urafá); his house was a gathering place for them, and the
philosophers” [TV 43, MF 23-4]; Darvísh Íidq-‘Alí “belonged to
the mystic element (‘urafá)” [TV 63, MF 36]; Óájí Mu˙ammad
Khán “became a mystic (‘urafá)” when he was very young [TV
142, MF 91]; Mishkín-Qalam “was among the most noted of
mystics (‘urafá)... [and] a spiritual wayfarer (sálik)6“ [TV 152, MF
98]; Óájí Áqáy-i Tabrízí was “a spiritual man (mard-i-rabbání)”
and “had sensed the mystic knowledge (‘irfán)” [TV 218, MF 142];
Mírzá Muß†afá “was concerned with the anemones of mystic
meanings” [TV 227, MF 148]; and Shams-i Îu˙á, the only woman

288                                                 Lights of Irfán vol. 17

among the nine, was “strongly attracted to the mystical
teachings (‘irfán) of... Siyyid Kázim-i Rashtí... [and] became
thoroughly informed on subjects relating to Divinity, on the
Scriptures and on their inner meanings” [TV 268; MF 176].
‘Abdu’l-Bahá does not praise these believers for possible
charismas [see Savi, “The Bahá’í Faith and the Perennial Mystical Quest”],
but for having escaped the snares of an obsolete form of
mysticism, with its emphasis on visionary and illogical elements,
and for having become lovers of the Truth as manifested by
Bahá’u’lláh and the champions of his Covenant. While speaking
of Darvísh Íidq-‘Alí He explains that Bahá’u’lláh wrote that the
word darvísh, often used in Persian to mean “mystic,”
“designates those who are completely severed from all but God,
who cleave to His laws, are firm in His Faith, loyal to His
Covenant, and constant in worship” [MF 38].

Darvísh Íidq-‘Alí recognized very early the Blessed Beauty,
perhaps during His residence in Kurdistan. He was the attendant
of the Shrine of Pír-Dávar, on mount Balábanú, “the mountain
of Sulaymáníyyih, to which Bahá’u’lláh went” [Eminent Bahá’ís
316] during His residence in Kurdistan in 1854–1856. There
Darvísh Íidq-‘Alí met Bahá’u’lláh and “on meeting Him came to
see in Him all the signs by which the Promised One was to be
recognized” [Eminent Bahá’ís 316]. Íidq-‘Alí was one of the
believers who were allowed to join the party travelling to
Constantinople. He served as groom on the journey. Taherzadeh
writes that he “used to walk all day beside the convoy, singing
poems which brought joy to the friends, and at night he
attended to the horses. From Constantinople he accompanied
Bahá’u’lláh on His exile to Adrianople, and then to ‘Akká”
[Revelation 1:289]. He died in 1880-81 and is buried in ‘Akká [see
Balyuzi, Bahá’u’lláh 482].

‘Abdu’l-Bahá informs us that:

> While in the barracks, Bahá’u’lláh set apart a special
> night and He dedicated it to Darvísh Íidq-‘Alí. He wrote
> that every year on that night the dervishes should bedeck

> a meeting place, which should be in a flower garden, and
> gather there to make mention of God. [MF 38]

It has been speculated that Lawḥ-i Laylatu’l-Quds I (Tablet of
the Sacred Night I), which may have been revealed in Adrianople
and is addressed to Darvísh Íidq-‘Alí, may be related to this
“special night.” And the Iranian Bahá’í scholar ‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd
Ishráq Khávarí (1902–1972) suggested that the Sacred Night of
this Tablet is the night of the Báb’s Declaration, 23 or 24 May
[see Ra˙íq-i Makhtúm 2:296]. In 1996 an inquirer asked the
Universal House of Justice about the above mentioned words
by the Master. On that occasion the Research Department of
the Universal House of Justice explained:

> there is no further information in Memorials about this
> event, and there is no clear evidence in historical
> documents so far reviewed as to how and by whom this
> celebration might have been observed. It also remains a
> question when it was discontinued. However, in his
> book Ganj-i-Shaygan [Ganj-i-Sháyigán], pages 209-210,
> the well known scholar, Ishraq Khavari states that the

That being said, I am aware that this special celebration has
been discontinued. However, the fact that the Blessed Beauty
had “set apart a special night” and that “He dedicated it to
Darvísh Íidq-‘Alí” [MF 38] is captivating. And I was thus moved
to make it the central theme of the following poem [see
Remoteness 262], together with the concept that He has
encouraged a totally new kind of mysticism:

Shaykh Íádiq-i-Yazdí

Shaykh Íádiq-i-Yazdí [see MF 43-4] was subjected to a very
special test, a kind of torment of Tantalus. When Bahá’u’lláh
left Baghdad to go to Constantinople, in May 1863, he was
among the lucky believers who were allowed to follow Him. But
when the caravan was about to leave Judaydah (‘Iráq), on the
river Tigris, where they had arrived on the seventh day of their
march and had stopped for three days, Bahá’u’lláh instructed
him and three other friends to return to Baghdad. Balyuzi writes
that Shaykh Íádiq “an old man greatly devoted to the person of
Bahá’u’lláh... felt so acutely the pangs of separation from Him
that he could not rest, and not long after, started, a solitary
figure, to walk to Istanbul. But he never finished the journey
and died on the way, at Ma’dan-i-Nuqrih [(Silver Mine)]”
[Bahá’u’lláh 178]. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains more specifically: “...
after the arrival of Bahá’u’lláh at Mosul, he could endure the
separation no more. Shoeless, hatless, he ran out alongside the
courier going to Mosul; ran and ran until, on that barren plain,
with mercy all about him, he fell to his rest” [MF 44]. This specific
episode is at the heart of the following unpublished poem:

> S HAYKH Í ÁDIQ - I -Y AZDÍ
> Bologna, 1 February 1999

> Shaykh Íádiq
> your Beloved
> did not want
> you to die on
> an easy bed.
> He wanted you
> to follow Him
> to Mosul. And
> then, shoeless,
> hatless, alone, on

> that barren plain,
> He came toward
> you, His cup filled
> with crystal water,
> tempered at the
> Camphor fountain.
> And you quaffed
> it with joy.

Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín Yazdí

Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín Yazdí [see MF 83-4] is one of those passionate
lovers who did their utmost to reach Bahá’u’lláh while He was
confined in ‘Akká, with the prohibition of meeting anyone.
Shoghi Effendi describes them as follows:

> The few pilgrims who, despite the ban that had been so
> rigidly imposed, managed to reach the gates of the
> Prison—some of whom had journeyed the entire distance
> from Persia on foot—had to content themselves with a
> fleeting glimpse of the face of the Prisoner, as they
> stood, beyond the second moat, facing the window of
> His Prison. The very few who succeeded in penetrating
> into the city had, to their great distress, to retrace their
> steps without even beholding His countenance. [GPB 187]

When he began his journey to go and meet his Beloved, he was
so sick that he passed away before attaining his destination, an
episode which is the leitmotiv of the following poem [see
Remoteness 271]:

> Z AYNU ’ L -‘Á BIDÍN
> Bologna, 1 February 1999

> You did not reach
> your journey’s goal

> on earth. You did not reach
> that sea which roars
> beneath the walls
> of the crimson City.
> Your body did not endure
> that journey’s toils.
> But when you closed
> your eyes for ever
> to this life, your Best-
> Beloved came toward you
> from behind His veils
> and the light of reunion
> dawned upon
> your loving heart.
> You never came away
> from that shining
> Presence. There,
> you live now in joy,
> devoted and true,
> stainless and faithful.

Shaykh ‘Alí Akbar-i-Mazgání

Shaykh ‘Alí Akbar-i-Mazgání [see MF 104-5] “by disposition
and because of the intense love in his heart,... yearned to write
poetry, to fashion odes and ghazals, but he lacked both meter
and rhyme” [MF 105]. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá numbers in his book other
seven believers who wrote poetry. Unlike Shaykh ‘Alí Akbar,
they were talented poets. These poets are Nabíl-i-Zarandí,
Darvísh Íidq-‘Alí, Áqá Mu˙ammad-Ibráhím, Mírzá Mihdíy-i-
Káshání, Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar-i-Najjár, Jináb-i-Muníb and Ṭáhirih.
Nabíl-i-Zarandí

> ... was a gifted poet, and his tongue most eloquent; a
> man of mettle, and on fire with passionate love... Day
> and night he sang the praises of the one Beloved of both
294                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> worlds and of those about His threshold, writing verses
> in the pentameter and hexameter forms, lyrics and long
> odes... His native genius was pure inspiration, his poetic
> gift like a crystal stream. In particular his ode ‘Bahá,
> Bahá!’ was written in sheer ecstasy. [MF 33, 34-35]7

Darvísh Íidq-‘Alí, also mentioned above as a mystic,

> had a fine poetic gift and wrote odes to sing the praises
> of Him Whom the world has wronged and rejected.
> Among them is a poem written while he was a prisoner in
> the barracks at ‘Akká, the chief couplet of which reads:

> A hundred hearts Thy curling locks ensnare,
> And it rains hearts when Thou dost toss Thy hair.

[MF 36]

Áqá Mu˙ammad-Ibráhím “had a fine poetic gift, and he
would create verses like stringed pearls” [MF 81]. Mírzá Mihdíy-
i-Káshání “in early youth, under his father’s tutelage,... had
studied sciences and arts, and had become skilled in composing
both prose and verse” [TF 95]. Also Ustád ‘Alí-Akbar-i-Najjár
was “a gifted poet, writing odes in eulogy of Bahá’u’lláh” [MF
102]. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also cites Jináb-i-Muníb, who “was a
calligrapher second to none, a poet, and... had as well a
remarkable singing voice” [MF 145]. This man will be mentioned
again later on. As to Ṭáhirih, a well-known Iranian poetess,8
‘Abdu’l-Bahá only hints at her “remarkable ability in literary
pursuits” [MF 191]. The auspice that although Shaykh ‘Alí Akbar
had no poetic talent in this world, perhaps in the Great Beyond
his Beloved may have granted him to become the inspirer of
aspiring poet in this nether world is the leitmotiv of the
following unpublished poem:

> S HAYKH ‘A LÍ A KBAR - I -M AZGÁNÍ
> Bologna, 6 January 1999

> Do not grieve that you lacked
> both meter and rhyme.
> Your eyes beheld the face
> of the Best-Beloved.
> Other hearts were granted
> a poetical vein and denied
> attaining the presence
> of the Best-Beloved.
> In centuries to come others
> like you will look after meter
> and rhyme in their praise
> of the Best-Beloved.
> From your world of love
> and light will you help them
> to give wings to their verses
> for the Best-Beloved?

Óájí Ja‘far and his brothers

‘Abdu’l-Bahá relates the incidents of the lives of Óájí Ja‘far
and his two brothers in a single biography [MF 122-5], because
they were related not only by their blood relationship, but also,
and especially, by their deep love for Bahá’u’lláh. Óájí Ḥasan is
so transported by this love that, because of his imprudence in
teaching the new Faith in Azerbaijan, is treacherously killed in a
garden and his torn body is hidden under-earth. Óájí Ja‘far is so
bound to Bahá’u’lláh that he sacrifices everything so that he
may remain beside Him. When in 1868 in Adrianople he
discovers that the authorities did not permit him to follow
Bahá’u’lláh in the Holy Land, he is so grieved that he cuts his
throat. Bahá’u’lláh later on wrote about him, as well as about
another believer who killed himself out of his love for Him:

> Such souls have been influenced by the Word of God,
> have tasted the sweetness of His remembrance, and are
296                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> so transported by the breezes of reunion that they have
> detached themselves from all that dwell on earth and
> turned unto the Divine Countenance with faces beaming
> with light. And though they have committed an act
> which God hath forbidden, He hath nevertheless
> forgiven them as a token of His mercy. He, verily, is the
> Ever-Forgiving, the Most Compassionate. So enraptured
> were these souls by Him Who is the All-Compelling that
> the reins of volition slipped from their grasp, until at
> last they ascended to the dwelling of the Unseen and
> entered the presence of God, the Almighty, the All-
> Knowing. [SLH 145]

Having survived to this desperate act, Óájí Ja‘far finally
manages to attain the presence of Bahá’u’lláh in the Holy Land
together with his brother Óájí Taqí. There he dies falling from
the roof of the caravanserai where he resides, while he paces
absorbed in his prayers. After this event Óájí Taqí remains
alone. He too dies in the same way: he falls from the roof of the
caravanserai. This human sequel of events binding these three
brothers, three “eagles soaring... three stars of the Faith, pulsing
with the light of the love of God” [MF 122] is the leitmotiv of
the following unpublished poem:

Ó ÁJÍ J A ‘ FAR   AND HIS BROTHERS

Bologna, 3 February 1999

> You were three brothers of Tabríz
> young soaring eagles of the Faith
> pulsing lights of the love of God.
> Óájí Óasan, by which insanity
> of love were you distracted?
> Why did you dance and sing
> shahnáz melodies in Azerbaijan?

> Brought to that lonely garden,
> you were tortured, killed and
> your body hidden underground.
> But your soul soared to Heaven
> well-pleased with her Lord
> and well-pleasing unto Him.
> Óájí Ja‘far, by which insanity
> of love were you distracted?
> Attempting suicide
> that you might follow an Exile
> in His exile. Love healed your
> wound, your yearning for exile
> was finally fulfilled. Where was
> your heart that night on
> the roof of the caravanserai?
> In the morning your lifeless
> body was discovered lying
> on the ground. Your exile was past.
> Óájí Taqí, silence
> personified, now that your
> brothers, companions
> of former days, left you
> alone, always sitting
> lonely in your room. Now,
> you flied away, you too, as
> your brother, from that roof
> toward his embrace and the
> embrace of your Beloved.

‘Abdu’lláh Baghdádí

About ‘Abdu’lláh Baghdádí [see MF 129-31] I could not find
any historical reference in the Bahá’í literature. The purport of
what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes about him, and as a matter of fact
about all the other believers described in Memorials of the
Faithful, is clarified by the following remarks by Price:

> He [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] describes many pilgrimages and you
> and I are left to construct our own. We all must shape
> and define our own life. Is it aesthetically pleasing?
> Intellectually provocative? Spiritually challenging?
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá shapes and defines these lives given the
> raw-data of their everydayness added up, added up over
> their lives as He saw them. How would He shape my life?
> Yours? How would we look in a contemporary anthology
> of existences with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as the choreographer
> and the history of our days as the mise en scène? [Price 3]

‘Abdu’l-Bahá writes in the beginning of His biography of
‘Abdu’lláh Baghdádí:

> When he was very young, people thought of ‘Abdu’lláh
> Baghdádí as a libertine, solely devoted to pleasure. He
> was regarded by all as the sport of inordinate desires,
> mired down in his physical passions. But the moment he
> became a believer, he was carried away by the sweet
> savors of God, and was changed into a new creation. He
> found himself in a strange rapture, completely
> transformed. He had been of the world, now he was of
> Heaven; he had lived by the flesh, now he lived by the
> spirit; he had walked in darkness; now he walked in light.
> He had been a slave to his senses, now he was a thrall of
> God. He had been clay and earthenware before, now he
> was a dear-bought pearl; a dull and lusterless stone
> before, now a ruby glowing. [MF 129-30]

This incipit is the leitmotiv of the following poem [see Remoteness
272]:

> ‘A BDU ’ LLÁH B AGHDÁDÍ

> O friend of joy
> your thirst for bliss
> is today appeased
> the wine you drink
> today does not make
> you lose your mind
> to make you wise
> it closes your eyes
> to this world
> and opens them
> to the Veilless Beauty.
> Today your feasts
> are celestial agapes.
> The gazelle-eyed
> maids you invite
> today are the virtues
> of your Lord. Broken
> your rusty fetters,
> your heart is bound
> today by the golden
> chains of faithfulness.

Jináb-i-Muníb

The story of Jináb-i-Muníb [see MF 145-7] is one of the most
fascinating and moving biographies of Memorials of the
Faithful. Friendship occupies a prominent position in human
life. And thus this story, revolving around the personal
friendship between ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Mírzá Áqá, the given
name of Jináb-i-Muníb, is full of inspiring details, comprising:
the charming personality of this man; his intimate relation with
the Master during their migration from Baghdad to
Constantinople; their riding (both of them teen-agers) beside
Bahá’u’lláh’s howdah and singing

> To our King though we bow the knee,
> We are kings of the morning star.
> No changeable colors have we—
> Red lions, black dragons we are! [MF 145, see Óáfiẓ, Divan
> 395-6]

and especially his sickness and final death, alone, in that foreign
hospital in Smyrna, and the Master’s words about that moment

> Whenever I think of that moment, the tears come; my
> heart is heavy and I summon up the remembrance of
> what he was. A great man; infinitely wise, he was,
> steadfast, modest and grave; and there was no one like
> him for faith and certitude. In him the inner and outer
> perfections, the spiritual and physical, were joined
> together. That is why he could receive endless bounty
> and grace. [MF 146]

Bahíyyih Khánum, the Greatest Holy Leaf (1846–1932), told
her version of the story of his passing to Sarah Lady Blomfield
(1859–1939), the first distinguished Bahá’í of the British Isles
and the first Bahá’í of Ireland, adding a small and moving detail:

> A dear friend of the family, Jináb-i-Muníb, was taken
> seriously ill. When the boat stopped at Smyrna, Sarkár-i-
> Áqá (‘Abdu’l-Bahá) and Mírzá Músá carried him ashore,
> and took him to a hospital. The Master bought a melon
> and some grapes; returning with the refreshing fruit for
> him—He found that he had died. Arrangements were
> made with the director of the hospital for a simple
> funeral. The Master chanted some prayers, then,
> heartsore, came back to the boat. [Lady Blomfield 65]

Taherzadeh writes that Bahá’u’lláh, in a Tablet describing
Jináb-i-Muníb’s passing in Smyrna, “says that when Jináb-i-
Muníb’s spirit ascended to his abode in the eternal worlds of
God, all the angelic souls and the Concourse on high rushed
forward to receive him with eagerness and love” [Revelation 1
286]. This pregnant story has inspired the following poem [see
Remoteness 263-4].

> J INÁB - I -M UNÍB
> Bologna, 25 December 1998

> Winsome, charming, refined,
> delicate, sensitive, a poet
> and singer, once a lover
> of worldly pleasures, a companion
> of the young Áqá, beside Him
> an escort of the Beloved’s howdah,
> a wise messenger of His love,
> an attendant at His Threshold.
> On that hospital bed in Smyrna,
> your mind never lost the memory
> of the last touch of His hands
> as He laid your head on that pillow.

Significance of some Sites Mentioned in

Memorials of the Faithful

Foad Seddigh

Abstract

Memorials of the Faithful is not merely a book devoted to
the hagiography of some believers and to some extent a
historical narrative of their lives, it is also a depository of
matchless beauty in Persian writing, an exquisite text with
profound meaning, and a testimonial to the devotion of
believers to the Cause of God and the Covenant. The believers
whose stories appear in the book comprised a diverse cross-
section of the Bábí and Bahá’í communities including believers
that society would consider low in rank as well as high, poor and
rich, semi-literate and learned.

In the book Memorials of the Faithful, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in the
course of portraying the life history of these believers, cited
many countries, cities, towns, villages and sites, some of which
were blessed by the foot-steps of the Twin Manifestations of
God for this age, and others which were important due to their
association with significant historical events of the Faith. In
this paper three such places were selected from among all the
sites mentioned in the book and their niche in the history and
the Writings of the Faith were further elaborated. These are: (1)
The Most Great House in Baghdad, (2) The ruins of Mada’in,

306                                          Lights of Irfán vol. 17

located some thirty kilometers south of Baghdad, on the banks
of the River Tigris, a place where the Blessed Beauty visited
many times, and which once graced the palaces of great kings of
the Sassanid dynasty, and (3) the city of Mosul in northern Iraq
on the banks of the River Tigris where a number of believers
and the Holy family were kept as captives for several years, a
city which Bahá’u’lláh’s caravan passed through on His journey
to exile in the seat of the Ottoman Empire.

The Most Great House

Bahá’u’lláh arrived in Baghdad on April 8, 1853 and stayed a
few days in the old quarters of the city then moved to al-
Káẓimíyyah (Káẓimayn),1 a holy town in the eyes of Shí’ah, Islám
[King of Glory p. 106]. Al-Káẓimíyyah houses the shrines of two
Shí‘ah Imáms and therefore is a place of pilgrimage for Shí‘ahs.
At the time, this place was at a distance of 10 km from Baghdad,
and now is one of the nine administrative districts within the
city. Soon after Bahá’u’lláh’s arrival, an official from the
Iranian consulate paid Him a visit and advised Him, in utmost
humility, that this place was not suitable for His residence.
Therefore, after staying a month in al-Káẓimíyyah, He moved to
a house in the Al-Karkh2 district of Baghdad, referred to as the
House of Óájí ‘Alí Madad. Due to the inadequacy of space in
this house, the holy Family was not comfortable, and lived in
cramped conditions. During the absence of Bahá’u’lláh during
his sojourn in the mountains of Kurdistan, the Family moved to
a house known by the name of Sulaymán-i-Ghannám, belonging
to Musá Javáhirí; this house was also located in the Al-Karkh
district (Bahá’u’lláh left Baghdad for Kurdistan on April 10,
1854 and returned on March 19, 1856 [King of Glory pp. 112-115]).
The Guardian describes this residence of Bahá’u’lláh with the
following words [GPB 129-130]:

> Within a few years after Bahá’u’lláh’s return from
> Sulaymáníyyih the situation had been completely
> reversed. The house of Sulaymán-i-Ghannám, on which
Significance of Some Sites                                       307

> the official designation of the Bayt-i-‘Aẓam (the Most
> Great House) was later conferred, known, at that time,
> as the house of Mírzá Músá, the Bábí, an extremely
> modest residence, situated in the Karkh quarter, in the
> neighborhood of the western bank of the river, to which
> Bahá’u’lláh’s family had moved prior to His return from

> moreover, become a veritable sanctuary to which the
> victims of the injustice of the official representative of
> the Persian government were wont to flee, in the hope of
> securing redress for the wrongs they had suffered.

The exact date of the family’s transfer to this house is not
known. The house of Sulaymán-i-Ghannám was rented at the
beginning and later on became a property of Bahá’u’lláh. This
transition is a fascinating story which has been narrated by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá in one of the chapters from the Memorials of the
Faithful where the life history of Mírzá Mu˙ammad-i-Vakíl is
narrated. A brief extract from His explanation is given below:

> There was a notable in Baghdád by the name of Óájí
> Mírzá Hádí, the jeweler. He had a distinguished son, Áqá
> Mírzá Músá,3 who had received from Bahá’u’lláh the
> title “Letter of Eternity.” This son had become a staunch
> believer. As for his father, the Óájí, he was a princely
> individual known for his lavish open-handedness not
> only in Persia and ‘Iráq but as far away as India....

> Toward the close of his life he conceived a remarkable
> love for Bahá’u’lláh, and most humbly, would enter His
> presence.... Such was the situation of that illustrious
> prince when he passed away, leaving as heirs a son and
> two daughters....
308                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

Mírzá Músá was a staunch believer; his sisters, however, were
from a different mother, and they knew nothing of the Cause.
One day the two sisters, accompanied by the son-in-law of the
late Mírzá Siyyid Ri∂á, came to the house of Bahá’u’lláh. The
two sisters entered the family apartments while the son-in-law
settled down in the public reception rooms. The two girls then
said to Bahá’u’lláh: “The Persian envoy, the judge, and the
faithless mujtahids have destroyed us. Toward the close of his
life, the late Óájí trusted no one but Yourself. We ourselves
have been remiss and we should have sought Your protection
before; in any case we come now to implore Your pardon and
help....” [MF 108 -109]

The Blessed Beauty refused to become involved in such
matters and they insisted and begged him to the extent that they
said they would not leave the house until He acceded to their
requests. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá further explains:

> Finally one day Bahá’u’lláh summoned me to His
> presence. “These esteemed ladies,” He said, “with all
> their exactions, have put Us to considerable
> inconvenience. There is no help for it—you will have to
> see to this case. But you must solve this entire,
> complicated matter in a single day...”. [MF 112]

The Blessed Beauty accepted to intervene and instructed
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to spend only one day to settle the matter.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá followed His instructions and resolved all the
matters of dispute to the best satisfaction of all. In return, they
gave one third of the inheritance to Him which at long last He
accepted and donated in its entirety to Mírzá Músá Javáhirí.
Then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explains further that:

> Grateful for the bounty he had received, Mírzá Músá
> offered Bahá’u’lláh everything he possessed: orchards,
> lands, estates—but it was refused. Then he appointed the
> ‘ulamás of ‘Iráq to intercede for him. They hastened to
> Bahá’u’lláh in a body and begged Him to accept the
Significance of Some Sites                                      309

> proffered gifts. He categorically refused. They
> respectfully told Him: “Unless You accept, in a very
> short time Mírzá Músá will scatter it all to the winds.
> For his own good, he should not have access to this
> wealth.”

> Then in his own hand, Mírzá Músá penned deeds of gift,
> made out according to each of the five creeds, in Arabic
> and Persian; two copies he made, and chose the ‘ulamás
> as his witnesses. Through certain ‘ulamás of Baghdád,
> among them the famed scholar ‘Abdu’s-Salám Effendi,
> and the erudite and widely known Siyyid Dávúd Effendi,
> he presented the deed of gift to Bahá’u’lláh. The Blessed
> Beauty told them: “We are appointing Mírzá Músá
> himself as Our deputy....” [MF 119]

This house was later on called the “Most Great House,” by
Bahá’u’lláh, which is one of the three locations designated for
pilgrimage for the Bahá’ís. The Most Great House in Baghdád
and the House of the Báb in Shiráz were designated in the Most
Holy Book (The Kitáb-i-Aqdas) for pilgrimage; ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
added to this list the third place which is Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh in
Akká, but He did not specify any rites for this pilgrimage [KA
191]. In Baghdad, Bahá’u’lláh and His family lived in this house
for a longer period than they did elsewhere in Iraq. The Most
Great House witnessed many events during the earlier years of
Bahá’u’lláh’s mission while He had not yet declared. Many
Tablets were revealed in this House, many believers attained
Bahá’u’lláh’s presence in this House, and many dignitaries and
men of status and knowledge met Him in this House.

When Bahá’u’lláh was exiled to Istanbul and Edirnih
(Adrianople) several believers became custodians of the House
among whom were: Gawhar Khánum (His wife from Káshán),
Mírzá Mihdí Káshání (Gawhar Khánum’s brother) and Mírzá
Mu˙ammad-i-Vakíl. Towards the end of Bahá’u’lláh’s stay in
Edirnih, nearly seventy believers among whom was Jináb-i-
Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín were arrested in Baghdad and sent as

310                                          Lights of Irfán vol. 17

prisoners to the city of Mosul. This deprived the House of
lawful custodians and in the interim some individuals looked
after the House. This is the earlier period that provided an
opportunity for the enemies of the Cause to transgress against
this House. It has been reported that a number of believers on
their way to ‘Akká stayed in this House. This included Badí‘, the
pride of the martyrs.

In the first year of His stay in Edirnih (Adrianople),
Bahá’u’lláh revealed two Tablets of pilgrimage (Surih-i-Hajj)4,
one for the House of the Báb and the other one for the Most
Great House and sent them to Nabíl Zarandí (Nabíl A‘ẓam) who
was travelling in Iran at the time proclaiming the news of the
appearance of the promised one of the Bayán. Bahá’u’lláh
instructed Nabíl to perform the pilgrimage according to the
instructions given in the Tablets. Nabíl Zarandí proceeded at
once and performed the pilgrimage according to the
instructions contained in these two Tablets. As far as the
history has recorded, Nabíl Zarandí is the only person who has
performed the pilgrimage in accordance with all the instructions

of the Tablet of Pilgrimage. Sheikh Mu˙ammad Damirtchi was
another person directed by Bahá’u’lláh to visit the House and
read a Tablet of Visitation at the House which had been
revealed in his honor. He performed the pilgrimage according to
the instructions, disregarding the mobs who were throwing
stones at him.

The Nobility of the Most Great House

Bahá’u’lláh extols the station of this House in several
Tablets, including the one which was revealed in the honor of
the aforementioned Sheikh Mu˙ammad Damirtchi. Some
passages from this Tablet appear below:

> When thou art departed out of the court of My
> presence, O Mu˙ammad, direct thy steps towards My
> House (Baghdád House), and visit it on behalf of thy
Significance of Some Sites                                     311

> Lord. When thou reachest its door, stand thou before it
> and say: Whither is the Ancient Beauty gone, O most
> great House of God, He through Whom God hath made
> thee the cynosure of an adoring world, and proclaimed
> thee to be the sign of His remembrance unto all who are
> in the heavens and all who are on the earth? Oh! for the
> former days when thou, O House of God, wert made His
> footstool, the days when in ceaseless strains the melody
> of the All-Merciful poured forth from thee! What hath
> become of thy jewel whose glory hath irradiated all
> creation? Whither are gone the days in which He, the
> Ancient King, had made thee the throne of His glory, the
> days in which He had chosen thee alone to be the lamp
> of salvation between earth and heaven, and caused thee
> to diffuse, at dawn and at eventide, the sweet fragrance
> of the All-Glorious?

> Where, O House of God, is the Sun of majesty and
> power Who had enveloped thee with the brightness of
> His presence? Where is He, the Day Spring of the tender
> mercies of thy Lord, the Unconstrained, Who had
> established His seat within thy walls? What is it, O

> of His enemies? The Lord bless thee, and bless thy
> fidelity unto Him, inasmuch as thou hast remained His
> companion through all His sorrows and His sufferings...

[GWB 111-112]

In relation to the names and titles of this House, The Guardian
states:

> Most Great House of God,” His “Footstool” and the
> “Throne of His Glory,” “the Cynosure of an adoring
312                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

> world,” the “Lamp of Salvation between earth and
> heaven,” the “Sign of His remembrance to all who are in
> heaven and on earth,” enshrining the “Jewel whose glory
> hath irradiated all creation,” the “Standard” of His
> Kingdom, the “Shrine round which will circle the
> concourse of the faithful” was irrevocably founded and
> permanently consecrated. Upon it, by virtue of its
> sanctity as Bahá’u’lláh’s “Most Holy Habitation” and
> “Seat of His transcendent glory,” was conferred the
> honor of being regarded as a center of pilgrimage second
> to none except the city of ‘Akká, His “Most Great
> Prison...” [GPB 110]

It is evident that the high station given to a House is due to its
association with the Manifestation of God and not because of
the materials, stones, bricks and concrete used to construct the
house.

Prophecy of the Desecration of the House

Bahá’u’lláh in some of His Tablets clearly predicted that the
House of God (The Most Great House) will be dishonored:

> Grieve not, O House of God, if the veil of thy sanctity
> be rent asunder by the infidels. God hath, in the world of
> creation, adorned thee with the jewel of His
> remembrance. Such an ornament no man can, at any
> time, profane. Towards thee the eyes of thy Lord shall,
> under all conditions, remain directed. He, verily, will
> incline His ear to the prayer of every one that visiteth
> thee, who will circle around thee, and calleth upon Him
> in thy name. He, in truth, is the Forgiving, the All-
> Merciful. [GWB 114]

Also the Sublime Pen writes in the following terms concerning
the future humiliation awaiting the House:

Significance of Some Sites                                      313

> Call thou to mind that which hath been revealed unto
> Mihdí, Our servant, in the first year of Our banishment
> to the Land of Mystery (Adrianople). Unto him have We
> predicted that which must befall Our House (Baghdád
> House), in the days to come, lest he grieve over the acts
> of robbery and violence already perpetrated against it.
> Verily, the Lord, thy God, knoweth all that is in the
> heavens and all that is on the earth.

> To him We have written: This is not the first humiliation
> inflicted upon My House. In days gone by the hand of
> the oppressor hath heaped indignities upon it. Verily, it
> shall be so abased in the days to come as to cause tears
> to flow from every discerning eye. Thus have We
> unfolded to thee things hidden beyond the veil,
> inscrutable to all save God, the Almighty, the All-
> Praised.... [GWB 114-115]

Although several attempts were made by the Shí‘ah clergy, the
ever vigilant enemy of the Cause of God in Baghdad, who tried
to wrestle away this House from the hands of its lawful owner,
but all their efforts in this regard failed miserably. Towards the
end of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Ministry, the condition of the House
deteriorated to such an extent that it was in a sorry state. One
of the new adherents of the Faith in Baghdad, Óájí Ma˙múd-i-

Qassábchí, with the permission from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and with his
own resources, undertook to repair the House. This period of
time coincided with the termination of World War I and the
dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. As a result, Iraq came
under the administration of the League of Nations, a new
constitution was adopted and the freedom of religion and belief
was announced. The reconstruction of the House and its
development produced a steadily widening measure of publicity.
This emboldened the Shí‘ah clerics to seize possession of the
House through the favourable judgement of an obscure Shari‘ah
Court which made several obvious and possibly deliberate
mistakes. This crisis which originated about a year prior to

314                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 17

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ascension eventually precipitated in its seizure
by Shí‘ah clerics in the summer of 1922. Since this time the
House has not been returned to the Bahá’ís. This House had
continued to be in the unbroken and undisputed possession of
Bahá’u’lláh’s followers ever since His departure from Baghdád,
a period of more than six decades. As an example of an obvious
mistake committed by the court was that it disregarded the rule
that fifteen years of lawful possession and occupation of a
house disqualifies any dispute attempted at the seizure of the
house.

This unjust ruling became the object of the consideration of
successive tribunals. First by the local Shí‘ah Ja‘faríyyih court in
Baghdád, second by the Peace court, then the court of First
Instance, then by the court of Appeal in Iraq, and finally by the
League of Nations, the greatest international body in existence
at that time. The League of Nations had been empowered to
exercise supervision and control over all Mandated Territories.
Though repossession of the House was not resolved due to a
combination of causes, religious as well as political, it has
already remarkably fulfilled Bahá’u’lláh’s own prediction
concerning the humiliation it will suffer in the hands of the
enemies of the Cause of God.

The appeal of the local Bahá’í community in Iraq, and those
of the International Bahá’í community from around the world,
as well as the letters of the Guardian written as the Head of the

Bahá’í Faith to the highest authorities and to King Faisal
produced no results; and the Government of Iraq under the
leadership of King Faisal remained adamant in acting in a
manner which was just—as he was much afraid of the religious
passion of the Shí‘ahs. Details regarding these communications
are comprehensively documented in the volumes of the Bahá’í
World: Bahá’í World II pp. 33-34, Bahá’í World III pp. 198-
210, Bahá’í World IV pp. 237-248, Bahá’í World V pp. 351-359,
and Bahá’í World VI p. 437.8 In these volumes, we find the
resolutions of various courts, minutes of the council of the
League of Nations, as well as some important letters. Among

the various accounts, Arnold Toynbee, the well-respected
British historian provides an informed accounting of the
situation concerning the House [Survey of International Affairs pp.
116-122]. The American Lawyer, Mountfort Mills, exerted
tremendous efforts and dedication towards securing possession
of the House for the Faith. In paying tributes to his effort, the
Guardian referred to him as “Mr. Mountfort Mills, whose
services to the Cause only future generations can estimate” [BA
127]. Other efforts included the audience of Miss Martha Root

with King Faisal I in Baghdad and her request for the
intervention by the King. Finally, the Government of Iraq
gained complete independence in 1932 and joined the League of
Nations in 1933 and all those who were involved with this
matter either died or were replaced and the case has remained
unresolved until this time despite several fundamental changes
of Government in Iraq. The final act was the news released by

the Universal House of Justice in a letter dated 17 July, 2013,
of razing the House almost to the ground by unknown
elements, without any legal permit from the Government,
between 24-26 June, 2013, in order to prepare the ground for
building a mosque on the spot where the Most Great House was
originally standing.

Promise of the Rise of the House of God

Bahá’u’lláh also prophesied that the House will suffer such
humiliation which will cause tears of the faithful to flow; after
that it will rise again and will find its high station which has
been destined for it. The Supreme Pen provides this assurance
with these words:

> In the fullness of time, the Lord shall, by the power of
> truth, exalt it in the eyes of all men. He shall cause it to
> become the Standard of His Kingdom, the Shrine round
> which will circle the concourse of the faithful. Thus hath
> spoken the Lord, thy God... [GWB 115]

Al-Mada’in Becomes the Seat of Glory

One of the chapters of Memorials of the Faithful is devoted
to the life of Mírzá Mu˙ammad-‘Alí, the Afnán who was
eventually buried in the vicinity of the ancient city of Mada’in.
Mírzá Mu˙ammad-‘Alí, the Afnán, was a cousin of the Báb and
the eldest child of the eldest uncle of the Báb for whom the
Kitab-i-Íqán was revealed. About a year prior to the departure
of Bahá’u’lláh from Baghdád for Istanbul, Mírzá Mu˙ammad-
’Alí who was a resident of Shanghai in China, along with his
younger brother, attained the presence of Bahá’u’lláh and
became aware of His high station. For the second time he gained
admittance to the presence of Bahá’u’lláh in ‘Akká—this is the
visit that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá describes in these terms:

> One day I was up on the roof of the caravanserai. Some
> of the friends were with me and I was walking up and
> down. It was sunset. At that moment, glancing at the
> distant seashore, I observed that a carriage was
> approaching. “Gentlemen,” I said, “I feel that a holy
> being is in that carriage.” It was still far away, hardly
> within sight.” Let us go to the gate,” I told them.
> “Although they will not allow us to pass through, we can
> stand there till he comes.” I took one or two people with
> me and we left... The gatekeeper stayed outside, the
> carriage drew up, the gentleman had arrived. What a
> radiant face he had! He was nothing but light from head
> to foot. Just to look at that face made one happy; he
> was so confident, so assured, so rooted in his faith, and
> his expression so joyous. He was truly a blessed being....

[MF 17]

During one of his trips from China, Mírzá Mu˙ammad-‘Alí
Afnán arrived in Bombay and took his flight to the Abhá
Kingdom due to an illness. However, the burial of his remains
became problematic and one of the believers by the name Áqá
Siyyid Asadu’lláh-i-Qumí according to the instructions of

‘Abdu’l-Bahá took the body to Iraq with the intention of
finding a burial place in one of the holy cemeteries of Islám.
Eventually, according to the instructions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, he
buried the body of Mírzá Mu˙ammad-‘Alí in the Salmán
Cemetery near Mada’in. Mada’in was once the seat of the
Government of the Sassanid dynasty which ruled over Iran for
five centuries, and eventually was defeated by the army of the
Arab Muslim invaders who plundered the riches of this
kingdom. Bahá’u’lláh is a descendant from this line of kings.
The city of Mada’in consisted of several smaller fortified cities
on both sides of the river Tigris. The city of Ctesiphon was one
of the cities and the seat of the government, and it housed
sprawling palaces which were the envy of the rulers of the world
at that time—as for its location, Mada’in is located nearly thirty
kilometers south of Baghdad. Salmán was the first Muslim ruler
for the newly opened territories, stationed in Mada’in and after
his death he was buried there in a place where it has become a
cemetery bearing his name; in this place Mírzá Mu˙ammad-‘Alí
Afnán was buried. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that this place is a holy
place because the Blessed Beauty walked there and revealed
Tablets; moreover He states that in this place a house of
worship (Mashriqu’l-Adhkár) should be built. The following is
His statement in the Memorials of the Faithful:

> Thus did God’s grace and favor encompass the Persians
> of an age long gone, in order that their ruined capital
> should be rebuilt and flourish once again. To this end,
> with the help of God, events were brought about which
> led to the Afnán’s being buried here; and there is no
> doubt that a proud city will rise up on this site.....

> At last, praised be God, it was laid down in the very spot
> to which time and again the Blessed Beauty had repaired;
> in that place honored by His footsteps, where He had
> revealed Tablets, where the believers of Baghdád had
> been in His company; that very place where the Most
> Great Name was wont to stroll. How did this come

> about? It was due to the Afnán’s purity of heart.
> Lacking this, all those ways and means could never have
> been brought to bear. Verily, God is the Mover of
> heaven and earth.

> I loved the Afnán very much. Because of him, I rejoiced.
> I wrote a long Visitation Tablet for him and sent it with
> other papers to Persia. His burial site is one of the
> holy places where a magnificent Mashriqu’l-
> Adhkár must be raised up. If possible, the actual
> arch of the royal palace should be restored and become
> the House of Worship. The auxiliary buildings of the
> House of Worship should likewise be erected there: the
> hospital, the schools and university, the elementary
> school, the refuge for the poor and indigent; also the
> haven for orphans and the helpless, and the travelers’
> hospice.... [MF 19-20]

The Guardian made the transfer of the remains of Mírzá
Mu˙ammad-‘Alí Afnán one of the goals of the Ten-Year
Crusade; the Bahá’ís of Iraq identified his grave, and transferred
his remains to the Bahá’í cemetery in Baghdad. The Hands of the
Cause of God residing in the Holy Land informed the Bahá’í
world community of the achievement of this goal of the plan on
June 14, 1959.11

Mosul

Mosul is another place which appears in the stories from
Memorials of the Faithful. In fact, the city of Mosul has been
mentioned twenty eight times in the book—this could be due to
a number of reasons, some of which are enumerated as follows:
o Mosul is one of the places where the caravan of

> Bahá’u’lláh on His way to Istanbul chose to stop and rest
> for a few days.

o About four to five years after Bahá’u’lláh left Baghdad,

> some believers of Persian descent were rounded up and
> were sent to Mosul in captivity including the family of
> Bahá’u’lláh.
o For some believers who traveled to Edirnih or ‘Akká via

> land, Mosul was one of the cities through which they
> passed on their way from Baghdad to Syria.
o Mosul is an old city near the ruins of the city of Nineveh

and was built on it.
o Mosul and Nineveh is the city of Jonas the prophet which

> is mentioned in the Old Testament as well as the New
> Testament, and in the Qur’án.

Now we will offer brief explanation regarding the above topics.

Mosul: Bahá’u’lláh’s Caravan Passed Through

Mosul is located some 350 km north of Baghdad and built on
the eastern banks of the river Tigris. Bahá’u’lláh’s caravan
stopped briefly in Mosul on its way to Istanbul. H.M. Balyuzi
gives a detailed accounts of this phase of the land travel of
Bahá’u’lláh to Istanbul [King of Glory 182]. In addition, the
Guardian writes: “In Mosul, where He tarried three days...” [GPB

\[156\] 

Mosul: Place of Captivity of Believers

Mosul is also the place of captivity for some Persian
believers. Approximately five years after Bahá’u’lláh left
Baghdád, through the mischief of the Consul General of Iran in
Baghdád, nearly seventy believers were arrested and sent in
captivity to Mosul for nearly twenty years. Included in this
group was the third wife of Bahá’u’lláh known as Gawhar
Khánum. Her marriage took place sometime in Baghdád before
the declaration of Bahá’u’lláh’s mission. While Navváb and
Mahd-i-’Ulya travelled with Him in all His exiles, Gawhar

320                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 17

Khánum remained in Baghdad with her brother, Mírzá Mihdiy-i-
Káshání. Bahá’u’lláh writes in the Tablet to the King of Persia:
“O King! The lamps of equity have been extinguished, and the
fire of tyranny hath so blazed on every side that My people have
been led as captives from Zawra’ [Baghdád] to Mosul, known as
Hadba.” In here, by “My people” He means his third wife,
Gawhar Khánum.

In this captivity, a believer who rendered unique and valued
services to the community was Mulla Zaynu’l-‘Abidin, named by
Bahá’u’lláh Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín (The Ornament of Those Who
are Nigh). He acted as a father in relation to this small band of
believers. Under his supervision a ‘charity fund’ was established.
His knowledge and learning, his understanding of the Faith, his
intelligent and well-balanced personality, together with a
delightful sense of humour, endeared him to the believers and
made him the focal point of the community. Bahá’u’lláh had
also instructed him in His Tablets to gather the friends together,
exhort them to unity and love, encourage them to deepen in the
Faith, and help them to attain heavenly qualities. He spent most
of his time transcribing the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and making
them available to the friends. In particular he had to make
several copies of those Tablets which were addressed to some or
all of the believers in Mosul, and give each one a copy [Revelation
of Bahá’u’lláh II, p. 335].

The Bahá’ís in Mosul, under the leadership and guidance of
Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín, soon became a model Bahá’í community
reflecting something of the spirit of the ‘Akká community.
While in Mosul, it became Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín's task to
transcribe the Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh that arrived from ‘Akká on
their way to Iran. Thus these Tablets could be distributed more
widely and each of those to whom a Tablet was addressed could
have a copy.

In the course of one of his journeys, Óájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Ali,
the Angel of Carmel, visited Mosul. He has written his
impression about the community in his popular book “Bahjat-us

Sudur”, Delight of Hearts. Mr. Taherzadeh has translated and
quoted this report:

In October 1885 Bahá’u’lláh gave permission for Zaynu’l-
Muqarrabín to go to ‘Akká where he took up residence in the
Khán-i-‘Avamíd, continuing to transcribe Tablets and
frequently having the honor of being in Bahá’u’lláh’s company.

\[1\] Al-Káẓimíyyah (Káẓimayn), literally “the Two Káẓim” or “the Two who

> swallow their anger”, is regarded a holy city by Shí‘ah Islám. It received its
> name from the two Shí’ah Imáms buried there: Imám Músá, son of Ja‘far
> and his grandson, Imám Mu˙ammad at-Taqí. A shrine was first built over
> their tombs, and subsequently the al-Káẓimíyyah Mosque. The area that
> now constitutes al-Káẓimíyyah was originally the location of a graveyard
> reserved for members of the Quraysh tribe (prophet Mu˙ammad’s tribe).
> This land was set aside for this purpose by the Abbasid caliph, Harun ar-
> Rashíd.

\[2\] Al-Karkh is a district of Baghdad in western banks of the river Tigris.

\[3\] Mírzá Músá Javahirí who received the title of “Letter of Eternity” from

> Bahá’u’lláh was the recipient of several Tablets from Bahá’u’lláh one of
> which is known by its Arabic title “Subhána-Rabbíya’l-A‘lá” which means
> “My Exalted Lord is free from Imperfections.” He was very much devoted
> to Bahá’u’lláh and was one of the firm believers. His father, Óájí Mírzá
> Hádí, formerly a Persian vizier, was highly esteemed by the inhabitants of
> that city. Towards the end of his life, Óájí Mírzá Hádí became attracted
> to Bahá’u’lláh and was devoted to Him, but not as believer. He would
> often enter His presence and sit at His feet in humility and self-effacement.

\[4\] In Adrianople (Edirnih), Bahá’u’lláh revealed two tablets concerning

> pilgrimage (hajj) to Bahá’í holy places. Surat al hajj II (Lawh-i-Hajj II, or
> Surat al-Hajj), addressed to Mírzá Mu˙ammad Nabíl-i Zarandí, describes
> the rites of the hajj to The Most Great House. These Tablets are published
> in: Amr va Khalq 4: pp. 109-117 and Tasbí˙ va Tahlíl pp. 77-90, 93-113.

\[5\] Mu˙ammad Damirtchi was a staunch believer in Baghdád whose father

> deprived him of his inheritance due to his faith and belief in Bahá’u’lláh.
> He set out on foot from Baghdád to ‘Akká. Finally he reached ‘Akká
> enduring great hardships on the way. Bahá’u’lláh called him to His

> presence and he passed through the rows of soldiers and nobody stopped
> him as though they had not seen him. For the story of his life, see
> (Mu˙a∂irát 1 & 2: p. 120). Also his picture appears in (Bahá’í World III: p.

214).

\[6\] Óájí Ma˙múd-i-Qassábchí was a newly declared Bahá’í during the time of

> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He served the cause in Baghdad during the time of ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá and the Guardian. He was the chairman of the Spiritual Assembly of
> Baghdad; his picture could be found in the (Bahá’í World II: p 68).

\[7\] King Faisal of Iraq or Faisal Ibn Husayn Ibn Alí al-Hashimi was the King of

> Iraq from 23 August 1921 to 1933. He was a member of the Hashemite
> dynasty. While in power, Faisal tried to diversify his administration by
> including different ethnic and religious groups in offices. However,
> Faisal’s attempt at pan-Arab nationalism may have contributed to the
> isolation of certain religious groups. King Faisal supported the forces of
> the British army and revolted against the ruling Turks towards the end of
> World War I. In 1921, Britain decided to step back from direct
> administration and create a monarchy to head Iraq while they maintained
> the mandate. Faisal agreed to become king. In August 1921 he was made
> king of Iraq. In 1932, the British mandate ended and Faisal was
> instrumental in making his country nominally independent. On 3 October,
> the Kingdom of Iraq joined the League of Nations. King Faisal died on 8
> September 1933, at the age of 48. He was succeeded on the throne by his
> oldest son Ghazi. Soon King Ghazi was killed in a car accident and his son
> Faisal II who was 3 years old became the successor of his father, but he
> had to wait for several years until he reached adulthood. Finally he and the
> royal family and his prime minister were assassinated in a military coup
> d'état.
