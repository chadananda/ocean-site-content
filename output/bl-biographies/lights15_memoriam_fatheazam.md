                       In Memoriam

The passing of three staunch and dear supporters of `Irfán
Colloquium, Mr. Hushmand Fatheazam, Dr. Amin Banani, and
Ms. Mahboubeh Arjmand, in 2013, is greatly regrettable and a
great loss to the organizers, participants and friends of the
`Irfán Colloquium. May the radiant souls of these three valued
friends be richly rewarded in the Abhá Kingdom.

Mr. Hushmand Fatheazam, from the start of the `Irfán
Colloquium and its publications, was a constant encourager,
inspirer and patron of the services rendered through this
project. We greatly benefited from his guidance and
collaboration. Whenever it was feasible for him, Mr. Fatheazam
and his dear wife Shafigheh Fatheazam were participating at the
`Irfán Colloquium sessions. Mr. Fatheazam’s presentations
immensely enriched our programs and we greatly enjoyed their
presence. Our publications contain the texts of some of his
presentations.

Dr. Amin Banani was one of the founders and patrons of the
‘Irfán Colloquium program in Northern California, at Bosch
Bahá’í School. As long as his health condition allowed it, he,
together with his dear wife Sheila Banani, was regularly
participating at the `Irfán Colloquium sessions, where he made
scholarly presentations, while Sheila coordinated the program of
the sessions conducted in English. He is especially missed at our
sessions convened at Bosch Bahá’í School.

Ms. Mahboubeh Arjmand, who passed away in San Diego,
was one of the supporters of the `Irfán Colloquium and was
regularly making contributions to Haj Mehdi Arjmand

Memorial Fund that sponsors `Irfán Colloquium services. Ms.
Arjmand passed away in San Diego. She was fondly remembered
as a devoted participant at various Bahá’í youth activities in
Iran.

Hushmand Fatheazam1

(1924-2013)

We begin by borrowing these stellar words from one of Mr.

Fatheazam’s closest friends and contemporaries who declared,
soon after his passing, that he was “…a majestic figure with a
legacy of spirituality, of humility, of scholarship, and of
steadfastness that will endure the tests of time and will inspire
generations to come.”2 Such an illustrious portrayal is not
ungenuine nor an ideal distant from the realm of possibility. It
is an eager accolade justified in a life indissoluble from the
religious faith which nourished it.

The opening scene is literally the dawning of the Day of God,
the earliest years of the new-born Revelation and the date is
1845\. “One day, crowds of people gathered in the streets of

408                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Shiraz to watch a procession. The cruel and impious Husayn
Khán, the Nizámu’d-Dawlih, ruler of the town had reviled and
cursed three men, stripped them of their clothes, burned their
beards, scourged one of them with one thousand lashes, and
pierced their noses and through the incisions cords were passed
with which the three men were led through the town. These
three heroes were: Quddus, Mulla Sadiq Muqaddas and Mulla
Ali Akbar Ardestani.”3 The first three Bábís known to have
suffered persecution for their faith on Persian soil. Hushmand
Fatheazam, born on January 8th, 1924, in Teheran, Iran, was the
great grandson of Mulla ‘Ali Akbar Ardestani, and his wife
Shafiqih Farzar, the great granddaughter of his fellow sufferer,
Mulla Sadiq Muqaddas (or Ismu’lláhu’l-Asdaq). As destiny
would have it, these two graceful sweethearts, married in 1948,
were already conjoined by their forebears some hundred years
earlier…

Such may be the auspicious beginning but these lives do not
go unchallenged, nor are they spared pain. Hushmand
Fatheazam was only 28, and alone in India (his wife and newly
born son, Shahab, to join him later in their pioneering post)
when he received news of the cruel murder of his father,
Nureddin Fatheazam, then Chairman of the National Spiritual
Assembly of Iran. Irresponsible farmers of a certain village near
Tihran attacked him most ferociously and tore him into pieces.
No voice was raised against these atrocities and no signs of
justice were ever manifested in the whole country. Only one
honor emerged from this horrific episode of martyrdom and
that was when Shoghi Effendi instructed that a tomb, in honor
of Nureddin Fatheazam, was to be erected on his behalf.
Another painful, unexpected loss would occur several years
later in the life of Hushmand Fatheazam with the passing away
of his youngest son, Shafiq, in Canada, in 1994. Historical
reporting of these particularly disconsolate events in more than
a century of suffering to one family is not to create pathos but
to show that even religiously dedicated and passionate men and
women, on the deepest personal level, are not spared ‘sorrow

and anxiety, regret and tribulation…the lot of every loyal
servant of God’. (BK 7)

Such unqualified allegiance to the Cause of God began when
Hushmand Fatheazam, at only 18 years of age, requested
permission from his father, Nureddin, to pioneer to Iraq. His
father responded that at such an age, under 21 years of age (the
age which makes Bahá’ís eligible for administrative posts), not
even his physical presence would assist in the formation of any
Local Spiritual Assembly. Hushmand, in his defense, mentioned
the story of a young pioneer whom Shoghi Effendi had praised
some years earlier for having formed Local Assemblies even
himself being unable to serve for similar age restrictions.
Hushmand, the eldest of four children, was granted his father’s
permission to leave Iran on this noble quest.

After a brief home-front pioneering later in Shiraz as a
married man (1950), Hushmand Fatheazam lived his first
memorable and glorious episode, as a pioneer in that land of
constellations we know as India at the onset of the Ten Year
Crusade of the beloved Guardian in 1953.

After completing the requirements of a doctoral degree
program in Persian Literature at Tehran University, Hushmand
Fatheazam won a special scholarship offered by the Indian
government for graduate studies at Tagore’s Visva Bharati
University, in Shantiniketan, West Bengal, today known as
Peace University. Mr. Fatheazam then earned an M.A degree in
Sanskrit Language and Literature from that University. He was
the only known Persian scholar in this particular field of study.
Although he was fully qualified to seek a faculty position back
in his home country, Iran, the young couple decided to remain
in India as pioneers of the Ten Year Plan. Dorothy Baker, the
Hand of the Cause of God visiting India in the early ‘50s, after
having given a series of lectures at the same University,
encouraged the Fatheazams to move to New Delhi, the capital,
to better serve the Faith. In 1955 Mr. Fatheazam was elected as
a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of

410                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 15

India and served as its Executive Secretary until 1963. He
performed that duty on a voluntary basis and had to support his
family with income earned from three part-time jobs. Among
these, was serving as program developer for the Persian section
of All India Radio. In addition to his expertise in Persian
language and literature he also did translation work for the
Iranian Embassy. Shafiqih, while taking care of their three very
young children, also engaged in dress-making to supplement
their limited income. Mr. Fatheazam would work all day at the
National Bahá’í Center and would conduct his work in the
evening at All India Radio from 9:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. with
translation work being completed at the weekends. This is how
Hushmand Fatheazam managed to offer his services as full-time
Secretary of the National Assembly without burdening the
National Fund.

In early 1960 following the Rampur conference a year
before, the Hand of the Cause of God Dr. Mohajer met with
the National Assembly of India and advised them to focus their
teaching activities on the rural areas sensing that the time was
propitious to begin mass teaching. A small team of volunteers,
led by Shirin Boman Meherabani, was recruited and contact was
made with the Bhilala tribal village, some fifty miles from
Indore, in the State of Madhya Pradesh. Thus began an activity
that spread as a fire that ‘blazeth and rageth in the world…’4 The
National Office, however, did not have the manpower nor the
financial resources to produce Bahá’í literature in various
languages fast enough to accompany the rate with which
multitudes were embracing the Faith. There was the imminent
need to recruit, train and send travelling teachers to the newly
opened localities and deepen the new believers and consolidate
newly developed Bahá’í communities. Managing the national
affairs of the Bahá’í community of India was so overwhelming
and so demanding that its execution seemed quite an impossible
job.

Under the pressure of so many heavy responsibilities, Mr.
Fatheazam introduced some very original, not to mention

innovative, measures. He would publish small postcards with
pictures of a fruit or a flower accompanied by a selected
quotation from the Writings in different Indian languages.
Bahá’í teachers would then give such cards to every family who
would embrace the Faith. Mr. Fatheazam later used the notes of
the courses he had given at Bahá’í summer schools to author a
book called The New Garden, first published in 1963, which
introduced the main verities of the Bahá’í Faith in a simple and
sweet language, and which acted as a kind of standard textbook
for new believers. This book is unique and has become an
international best seller, today translated into one hundred and
nine languages and continually being reprinted and published in
new editions worldwide.

These achievements were undertaken by Mr. Fatheazam in the
true spirit of voluntary service to the Cause, that is, without
remuneration. He never did receive, or wish to receive, any
royalty from the many books he published in his life. He did
make sure, however, that the monies drawn from these books
were donated to one of the many Bahá’í projects. Both Mr.
Fatheazam and his wife, Shafiqih, were content to lead a very
simple life, but their simple home was always open to entertain
both Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í visitors alike.

Destiny articulates itself unbidden and the ensuing chapter
in the life of Hushmand Fatheazam can only be labeled as
dramatic. The daughter of no less a person than Mulla ‘Ali
Akbar Ardestani was amongst the 6,000 Bahá’ís who were
attending the World Congress in London in 1963 where the first
historic Universal House of Justice was formally presented to
the Bahá’í world. Hushmand, her grandson, was standing, with
eight others, with his hands clasped and head bowed, before a
cheering multitude gathered in the Royal Albert Hall.
Protagonists of a fascinating period of Bahá’í history, these
very first ‘passion-wingèd Ministers of thought’5 faced an
immense challenge representing not only an institution with no
precedent or history but a world-wide community struggling to
be born. Their summons was larger in that these nine men had to

412                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

ensure the welfare not just of the community it was created to
protect but “…to foster that which is conducive to the…
advancement and betterment of the world.”6 A momentous era
in human history was fused with a life-shaking personal
transition of nine individuals. Surely this cannot be confined to
a singular expression. The moment speaks more than its own
historical situation.

However, it was not his membership on the Universal House
of Justice, which was to last 40 years — a value in itself — which
providentially earns Hushmand his place among God’s heirs.
This is not enough to endear him. Sires of an immortal strain,
what makes him and his fellow-members exceptional in these
early years of the birth and functioning of the House of Justice,
was the inestimable and privileged seating from which to
witness historic undertakings and deliberations associated with
that august body, be they legislative, as enshrined in the
Constitution signed on the Day of the Covenant 1972, be they
significant enunciations (for example, The Promise of World
Peace, distributed to many politicians and prominent
individuals since its writing in 1985, is the first, and still only,
official public statement made by the Universal House of
Justice since its inception), be they Holy Sites developments
and ever-extending gardens along the perennial designs laid
down by the beloved Guardian, be they the completion of
almost all of the buildings of the Arc (there only remains the
International Bahá’í Library yet to be constructed), the
formation of institutions anticipated by Shoghi Effendi, such as
the International Teaching Centre established in 1973, a
paradigm shift in modes of thinking by raising collective
consciousness that led to “...a change in the culture of the
community,”7 and so many other stupendous developments and
triumphs in any of the many spheres of the supreme
institution’s responsibility. It would not be wrong to say that
these men lay their heads on stone, and sleep waking, fixing
their gaze by day and by night unable to flee the business of the
world or the heavy burden of work. Self-sacrifice is their proper

end — a sacrifice particularly hard felt by an adamantine
Hushmand in his shouldering “almost single-handedly the day-
to-day tasks and anguish and sheer exhaustion of being the link
of communication between the House of Justice and the friends
in Iran”8 during the fierce and continuing onslaught of the
modern persecution of this Bahá’í community since 1980.

In May 2003, Hushmand and Shafiqih left Haifa, never to
return. One curious fact was that Hushmand never went on
pilgrimage. Such a glaring omission living in such proximity to
the Holy Sites was as much imposed by his tenure as by the
circumstances prior to his election to the House of Justice. He
always wanted to visit Shoghi Effendi but was deprived. He
made his pilgrimage, though, through life — a life with more of
the qualities of a folktale in its humor and witty, realistic
observations about the world than a soberly biblical prose.

Hushmand Fatheazam’s departure from Haifa and its solemn
obligations was never seen as emancipation. His final ten years
spent in Vancouver, Canada, plunged him into feverish, creative
activity, such as being a regular radio broadcaster in Payam-e-
Doost where more than 400 weekly talks have been recorded in
the Persian language, reaching his fellow citizens in Iran and
where many declared themselves as Bahá’ís. Listeners are
numbered in the hundreds of thousands. These talks are now
being assembled in several volumes to be re-published with the
heading Afkar-i-Naw, Goftar-i-Naw. He translated the books of
Shoghi Effendi into Persian from the original English, namely,
The Advent of Divine Justice and The World Order of
Bahá’u’lláh. He also translated into Persian voluminous
biographical works, such as Mr. Faizi and the Maxwells of
Montreal (the first volume). He published his book
Introduction to the Bahá’í Faith in Persian which to date has
sold 35 thousand copies mostly distributed in Iran. His book of
poems was published in 2005 and a new edition is being planned
as the entire stock has long since been sold. He recently began
his book on the Persian writings of Shoghi Effendi, entitled
Bahr-i-Por Gohar, but managed to complete only three chapters,

414                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

having begun writing the fourth when the die cast of scholarship
was interrupted from the spirit which was molding it.
Hushmand Fatheazam’s capacity for work was undeniably
extraordinary and his literary output of the rarest quality.
Mojtaba Minavi (1903–1976), the well-known Iranian historian,
literary scholar and professor of Tehran University, praised
Hushmand, then only 21 years of age, for his outstanding
translation of Tolstoy’s “A Confession” offering it as an
absolute model for its writing style and interpretative potential
as well as linguistic patterns. His distinct style of writing is
worthy of study and emulation. If we were to identify a
constant in Hushmand Fatheazam’s literary output it would be
this: his writings, his poems, his public talks, the ethical
structure of his life pinned on the sovereign idea of transience
not to demean the world or to mock it — he never wished for
anyone to crave for finality — but to impel us to step into
eternity while still on excursion here on earth. Hushmand’s
prodigious literary production rested on the firm belief that to
survive the vicissitudes of fortune one must make ‘the leap of
faith’, a personal commitment to the kind of life not dependent
on the contingencies of success or human love which always
make life unsatisfactory but on a life which rests upon a
relationship with God. Hushmand Fatheazam’s intellectual and
literary endowment, despite his call to onerous, uninterrupted
Bahá’í service, will give the world another heart and other
pulses.

His very last service to the Faith was his participation in the
Youth Conference in Vancouver, on Sunday morning, August
4th, 2013. “His stirring talk at that event called by the Universal
House of Justice was truly a gift of encouragement to those
gathered there. His spiritual life, which began as a youth in
Teheran all those years ago, bore its final sweet fruit among
these youth in Canada. How lucky they were to hear him and
how blessed he was to die with his boots on…”9 That afternoon,
he suffered a heart attack and was taken to hospital never to

fully regain consciousness. He passed away just before midday,
August 13th.

This final act really depicts Mr. Fatheazam’s life as a
serpentine verse. It began with the word faithfulness and ended
with it. His life was accomplished because it was harmoniously
unified. He consistently obeyed his inner self open to the world
and its objects but molded, paradoxically, by institutions,
traditions, and all the social regulators shunned by modern man.
Therein lay his self-sufficiency and self-reliance because these
were spiritually guided not by an inner law but by a law which
was the province of established religion. He showed us that to
respect authority is not servility but stability and more, love.
Indeed, he materialized in its essence ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s injunction:
“Obedience is the rod by which I measure the love of the
friends.”10 His was the tenderest ‘radiant heart that exuded an
all-embracing love’,11 making no difference between feeling for
someone (sympathy) and feeling as them (empathy), all the time
recognizing that while qualities common to the human species
went into the making of it, ego is born only because humanity is
suppressed and unloved.

In any context within this delightful or alarming, disheveled
world, Hushmand Fatheazam was unchangeable, consistent and
never self-divided because he lived in an attitude of prayer, an
attitude which enacted a personal history in which coherent
evolution was shown to be possible and why it inevitably leads
to felicity. His particular greatness was his humility. “He
combined humility and nobility to perfection.”12 Once, on being
asked as a member of the Universal House of Justice, how he
assessed his role in the worldwide development of the Bahá’í
Faith, Hushmand replied: “Individual’s role always gets
amalgamated in any institution of the Bahá’í Faith. I firmly
believe that each Bahá’í reflects the will of God in all his
undertakings, though he plays his role relative to his level of
consciousness, no matter where he is placed.”13 Hushmand was
really saying that individuals on the House disappear in
membership, a similar disposition shared by his contemporary

416                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

and colleague since the earliest days Mr. Ian Semple, himself the
longest serving member of the House and who passed away in
2011\. On those early years, he wrote:

> There was, from the very first, an extraordinary feeling
> of unity and love among the members, and also of
> absolute dependence on the strength and guidance of
> Bahá’u’lláh. The image which came to my mind at that
> time was that we were a handful of pebbles in the palm
> of God.14

We end this brief outline as we began, with another written
remembrance, but this tribute is more poignant, marching,
distinctly relevant, and infinite:
