**AYĀDĪ-**E **AMR ALLĀH,** “Hands of the Cause of God” (sing. also _ayādī_, normally preceded by the reverential term _ḥażrat_), term used in Bahaʾism to designate the highest rank of the appointed religious hierarchy. In early Babism, an attempt was made to establish a hierarchical system based on eighteen groups of nineteen believers under the overall authority of a nineteenth group consisting of the Bāb and his first eighteen disciples, the Letters of the Living (_ḥorūf al-ḥayy_) or Foregoers (_sābeqūn_); but there is no evidence that, apart from the latter group, this system was ever made effective. Later Bābi writings such as the Persian _Bayān_ and _Panj šaʾn_ speak of “mirrors” (_marāyā_), “glasses” (_bolūrīyāt_), “guides” (_adellāʾ_), “letters” (_ḥorūf_, _ḥorūfāt_), and “witnesses” (_šohadāʾ_) (see _Panj šaʾn_, pp. 34, 63, 102, 120, 128, 131, 134-35, 136, 149, 163, 176, 184-85, 193, 200, 209, 235, 247, 257, 280; _Bayān-e fārsī_, pp. 82, 89, 90, 91, 165, 180); but no systematic attempt seems to have been made to create an organized structure based on any of these groupings. In the 1850s, Mīrzā Yaḥyā Ṣobḥ-e Azal, as the generally-recognized successor of the Bāb, did attempt to organize a system of agents, to whom he gave the title _šohadāʾ_, but this never developed into a permanent leadership cadre.

With the emergence of Bahaʾism in a context of conflicting claims to leadership within the Bābi community, any attempt to formalize a hierarchy was abandoned. In reinforcement of his own claim to be the messianic fulfillment of Babism, Bahāʾallāh argued that the Bāb had abrogated the rank of successor (_waṣī_) and that in the _Bayān_ only “letters” and “mirrors” had been named, the latter being “unlimited” (_mārāyā rā ham maḥdūd na-farmūda-and_; _Lawḥ-e serāj_, p. 40). As the new movement developed, however, it became necessary to delegate certain essential religious functions to various individuals and, towards the end of Bahāʾallāh’s life, two small groups emerged as possible nuclei for a more developed hierarchical structure. These were known as Names of God (_asmāʾ Allāh_; e.g., _esm-Allāh al-mīm_, _esm Allāh al-jamāl_) and Hands of the Cause of God. The latter group consisted of four individuals: Ḥājjī Mollā ʿAlī-Akbar Šahmīrzādī, Ḥājjī Mīrzā Moḥammad-Taqī Abharī (Ebn Abhar), Mīrzā Moḥammad-Ḥasan Adīb-al-ʿolamāʾ, and Mīrzā ʿAlī-Moḥammad (Ebn Aṣdaq). Their functions seem to have been to promulgate Bahaʾism, to organize the community of believers in Iran, to advance arguments against opponents (particularly against the Azali Bābis), and to preserve doctrinal unity.

On the death of Bahāʾallāh in 1892, the rank of _esm Allāh_ seems to have fallen into desuetude (partly through defection), but the four Hands continued to function under the direction of Bahāʾallāh’s son and successor ʿAbd-al-Bahāʾ. The latter referred in writing to a number of individuals as _ayādī_, but made no formal appointments to this position. He did, however, define their functions more clearly in his Will and Testament (_Alwāḥ-e waṣāyā_), where he also indicated that his successor, the future Guardian of the Cause (_walīy-e amr Allāh_), was to appoint such individuals and direct their activities. In effect, these Hands were to form a religious aristocracy under the leadership of the head of the faith. Shoghi Effendi, who succeeded to the position of _walī_ in 1921, made only eight posthumous appointments, for the most part westerners, between then and 1951. In that year, he appointed twelve living Hands, three each in Israel, Iran, America, and Europe. In 1952 the number was raised to nineteen, a figure maintained by new appointments following the deaths of several individuals until 1957, when the total was again raised to twenty-seven.
