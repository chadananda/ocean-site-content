THE BEGINNING

In Bisbee and Douglas

The first public reference made in North America to the Bahà’i Faith occurred in 1893.'
On September 23 o f that year, at the W orld’s Parliament o f Religions held in Chicago in
conjunction with the Columbian Exposition, the Rev. George A. Ford, a Presbyterian
minister serving as a missionary in Syria, read a paper written by fellow-missionary Rev.
Henry H. Jessup.2 This public address included a reference to the recent death of
Bahà’u ’ilàh and quoted Bahà’u ’ilàh’s following words:

> “That all nations should become one in faith and all men brothers; that the
> bonds o f affection and unity between the sons o f men should be
> strengthened; that diversity o f religion should cease and differences o f race
> be annulled; what harm is there in this? Yet so shall it be. These fruitless
> strifes, these ruinous wars shall pass away, and the ‘Most Great Peace’
> shall come... Let not a man glory in this, that he loves his country; let him
> rather glory in this, that he loves his kind.”3

Seven years later, in 1900, a related event that also had its beginnings in Chicago
occurred in a distant frontier town in rugged and isolated mountainous hills o f the
Territory o f Arizona *

An early account o f Arizona Bahà’i history states, “The new century [1900] finds just
one person who had heard and was deeply attracted to the Baha’i Message in the vast
Territory in Arizona.”4 That person was Nellie Stevison French who had moved from
Chicago to Bisbee, Arizona, in 1900.5

Nellie French, accompanied by her mother Mrs. (Sarah) Josiah Hill Stevison, had
attended a few meetings around 1896 at the home o f a Bahà’i, Dr. Ibrahim George
Kheiralla, on West Adams Street in Chicago.6 Dr. Kheiralla usually presented a series of
twelve or thirteen lessons that included discussing “various religious subjects current at
the time” and the last three classes provided information about the Bahà’i religion,
“presenting it as the fulfillment o f biblical prophecy.”7

Nellie Stevison was bom in Chicago in 1868 and was raised to be a cultivated woman of
her day. Around the age of twenty she went to Europe where she remained for four years
and trained for the operatic stage and studied the French and Italian languages.8Her plans
to devote her life to operatic singing were interrupted by a serious illness, however, and
the resultant damage to her vocal chords forced her to abandon her plans.9 Following her

*Arizona would become a State in 1912.

return home she married Stuart French in 1894,10 about two years before she attended Dr.
Kheiralla’s Bahà’i meetings. It was Mr. French’s business interests that took the couple in

1900 to Bisbee, a town in the southeastern comer of the Territory o f Arizona. In Bisbee,
Mr. French worked for the Copper Queen Mining Company, owner o f the famous Copper

> Queen Mine one of Arizona’s great ore producers, where he was Assistant Superintendent
o f mines.11

Toward the end o f the 1800s, Bisbee had evolved from a mining camp and “raw
> settlement o f prospectors, burros, and saloon keepers”12 into an established mining town of
> several thousand people13 in one o f the richest copper districts in America. By 1900 Bisbee
> had become a lively boomtown of nearly 20,00014 people as the rich copper bearing hills
> produced tons of the ore in a twenty-four hours a day mining operation. A daily train
brought mail, news, and supplies.15 Other amenities included the Copper Queen’s large

> department store, a library built by the Copper Queen Company, a YMCA, hospital,
> school, and a few churches. Management personnel and many o f the U S. and European
> professional miners and engineers brought their wives and “built fine homes” to house
their families— although the setting of a “rocky, forlorn landscape couldn’t compare to

> even a modest middle-class neighborhood back East”16—while saloons, gambling halls,
> dance halls and boarding houses lined the popular Brewery Gulch area, one o f the tow n’s
main thoroughfares.

Hand o f the Cause Amelia Collins,17 who would become a Bahà’i in 1919 in Pasadena,
California, lived in Bisbee briefly in the early 1900s. She later recalled the dirt road
through the middle o f town with boards to enter the rickety and noisy saloons that lined
the road where, she stated, “I was safe walking past those saloons as any lady on Park
Avenue.. .Rowdy and dirty as those miners were— they were all gentlemen.”18 But it was
a man’s town with little to offer respectable women in the way o f cultural, intellectual or
social pursuits. It was to this setting that the refined Nellie French, with her background o f
foreign travel, two foreign languages and with training in operatic singing, arrived in 1900.
Perhaps Nellie noticed the sign OPERA HO USE over the door o f a large barnlike structure
up on a hill19 where local entertainment and dances were held but where no operas familiar
to Nellie took place.

In response to their longing for companionship and meaningful activities, the women o f
Bisbee had formed sewing and reading clubs. Nellie French belonged to the Bisbee
Reading Club in 190020 and perhaps prior experience in Chicago led her to propose the
well-received idea o f an even larger club. Twenty women responded to her idea and on
October 24, 1900, they met and formed the Bisbee Woman’s Club, a club through which
the women could “be o f service to the community as well as to each other,”21 and Mrs.
French was elected its first president.22 A year later the club was asked to send
representatives to Phoenix to consider forming an Arizona Federation. The Bisbee ladies
were pleased to receive such “outside recognition— a sense o f belonging” being isolated in
those rugged mountains o f southeastern Arizona and “enduring the local ‘razzing’ that all
club women were given” in those early days.23

During Mrs. French’s term o f office, the Bisbee Woman’s Club raised money for a
clubhouse on Quality Hill24 where they built and owned the first Woman’s Club building in
Arizona. It was finished in time for their fall meeting in October 1903.25 Club members and
officials of the mining companies and their wives, among them Mrs. French, provided

most o f the furnishings. One o f the officials, Thomas Collins,26 husband o f Amelia
Engelder Collins, gave the kitchen stove that burned wood and coal.27

Perhaps through Nellie’s influence, the pledge o f the Bisbee Woman’s Club was copied
from the Chicago Woman’s Club.28 The Bisbee club’s objective was to foster the

> intellectual and social advancement o f its members through the formation o f four
> departments: Literary, Educational, Current Events, and Social. After a few months, an
> addition was made to the Club’s aims: “and the general improvement o f our city.”29 A
> photo o f Nellie French, founding president and president for three years, was placed in the
Bisbee Woman’s Club building in 190430 and is still displayed there today.31 Nellie’s

> significant and continued association with the Bisbee club and, later, the Arizona
> Federation o f Women’s Clubs, provided receptive audiences that would hear o f the Bahà’i
Faith.

In 1904 Mr. and Mrs. French moved to Douglas, about twenty-five miles east o f Bisbee,
> when the copper smelter was moved there. The townsite o f Douglas was laid out to
> support the new and needed smelter center and the town “literally grew up overnight, right
> around those mines.”32 Mr. French was made head o f the new smelter33 and Douglas
became home to the Frenches until 1917.

During their years in Douglas, Nellie French continued to be active in the work of
women’s clubs and served as the third president o f the Arizona Federation o f Women’s
Clubs from 1905-1907.34 She was described as “the ideal type to lead the federation in its
pioneer days. She was a woman o f distinctly feminine charm, financially independent, with
the funds and leisure to travel in the State, spread in the ‘new gospel’ [the Bahà’i
message?] and advance federation interest.”35 It is recorded that her visits to Chicago and
New York furnished a few Baha’i contacts with meager information36 and after first
hearing about the Bahà’i Faith in 1896 in Chicago she had kept up a sporadic interest.37

In 1916, most likely toward the end o f the year. Miss Ella Bailey, a dedicated Bahà’i
from Berkeley, California, was visiting in Douglas and unexpectedly encountered Nellie
there.38 Miss Bailey somehow learned that Nellie had heard the Bahà’i message and she
promptly summoned Isabella D. Brittingham,39 an early prominent Bahà’i lecturer and
writer who was able to devote time to extensive traveling, visiting the Bahà’is and
spreading the message o f the Bahà’i Faith. Mrs. Brittingham was soon at the side o f this
“newly found Bahà’i.”40 It was reported that Isabella Brittingham’s visit in 1917
“confirmed Nellie who became the first resident Bahà'i teacher in Arizona.”41 (As will be
seen, earlier, in 1915, a family o f active Bahà’i teachers had moved to South Bisbee.)

An account by Mrs. Brittingham of her visit to Nellie French in Douglas was published
in Star o f the West, March 21, 1917:

> Early on the morning o f my arrival there, this dear newly-found Baha'i
> sister came to me and arranged for an open meeting to be held the next
> Saturday night at the Y.W.C.A. club room s... .Then this dear sister opened
> her home and during the two weeks of my stay in Douglas a number o f
> beautiful meetings and personal interviews were held... ,42

Those “beautiful meetings” apparently included Bahà’i-related study classes at the
Frenches’ home.43 Mrs. Brittingham also spoke about the Bahà’i Faith to individuals and

small groups during visits to Tucson and Phoenix.44 “In Phoenix,” reported Mrs.

Brittingham, “one of Miss Bailey’s letters o f introduction brought to us an invitation to the
home o f some lovely Christian Scientists, to meet at dinner the Governor o f Arizona
[George W. P. Hunt] and his wife and several well known New York City people. All
were interested in the message. Our hostess45 opened her home one afternoon and called a
number o f her friends to hear the glad tidings. The governor’s wife was present and
brought the wife o f the governor’s private secretary. This secretary is the brother of our
own dear [Bahà’i] Isabel Fraser.”45

On Thursday, January 25, 1917, Mrs. Brittingham gave an address on “Universal Peace”
at the Annual Convention o f the Arizona Federation o f Women’s Clubs that was held that
year in Globe.47 A minister at the small mining town of Pearce invited her to give “the
principles o f the Baha'i Movement” in his church one Sunday evening and the following
morning the minister gave her a letter of introduction to a brother clergyman in Tucson.48

Mrs. Brittingham reported, “In Bisbee, several small meetings were held in homes.49 At
one o f them, there were nine guests, seven o f whom were Mormons” and she concluded,
“About a hundred and fifty souls in Arizona, some in groups, some individually, have
heard the message, and now the ground has just been broken for other traveling teachers
to accomplish a fuller work in the glorious Cause of God.”50 Her report also stated that as
a result o f her two weeks in Douglas, “the first Baha'i assembly o f Arizona has been
established.”51 This has led some to conclude that Arizona’s first Local Spiritual
Assembly, the local administrative body in the Bahà’i Faith, was established in Douglas.
However, the Local Spiritual Assembly o f Phoenix is documented as being the first in
Arizona; it was formed by election in 1930.52

In 1917 Nellie French’s mother, who apparently also had embraced the Faith, appears to
have been staying with the Frenches and she was a delegate that year to the Bahà’i Temple
Unity* Convention representing Douglas, Arizona.53 In May, an observance of the
Declaration of the Báb was held at the Frenches’ home with about thirty-five women
present.54

Baha’i visitors to Douglas in 1917 included Helen S. Goodall55 and her daughter, Mrs.

Ella Cooper, both from California; also Mason Remey from Washington, DC, who spoke
about the Faith to a large audience gathered at the local High School building.56

Later in 1917 Nellie with her husband and mother moved from Douglas to Pasadena,
California.57 But Arizona was not left bereft o f Bahà’i activity because shortly before Miss
Bailey’s 1916 discovery o f Nellie French in Douglas and Mrs. Brittingham’s subsequent
visit there, the Duckett family had moved to Bisbee (South Bisbee).

In 1915 Mrs. Viola Duckett, a Bahà’i who was a widow with two grown daughters,
Bessie and Gladys, moved from Fauquier County, Virginia, near Washington, DC, to
Bisbee where according to Bessie they had relatives, “an aunt and uncle.”58 The uncle,
Richard Duckett, was foreman for a shift at the Briggs Mine in the Bisbee-Warren mining
district. Bessie and her family lived about three miles south o f Bisbee (South Bisbee, a
mineworkers’ enclave) near the Briggs Mine in a house that was located “off the road to

* "The first representative national BaháT administrative body... .established by the North American Bahà’is in 1909
to oversee the project to construct a Bahà’i Mashriqu’l-Adhkar [Bahà’i House o f Worship] in the Chicago
area....The Executive Board developed into the American national spiritual assembly during the early 1920s.”
(Smith, Concise Encyclopedia, p. 70.)

Douglas between two hills.” Bessie and Gladys59 Duckett worked in Bisbee; Gladys at the
Fair Store, a general merchandising store, while Bessie sold and fitted women’s

> undergarments (corsets, etc.) at Mrs. Norris’s hat shop where she received rental space in
> return for also selling hats.60 Their jobs would have brought the two sisters into contact
> with women residents of Bisbee and perhaps presented opportunities to invite some of
them to hear about the Bahà’i Faith.

Bessie and her mother were ardent teachers o f the Faith all their lives. Bessie’s mother,
> Viola Duckett (later known as Viola Everly),61 actively taught up to the time o f her death
> in 1967 at the age of 102.62 She first heard the Bahà’i message in 1904 through a friend,
Marie Watson, in Washington, DC. The death o f Viola Duckett’s nine year old son in

1909 caused her to search for answers that she found in the Bahà’i teachings. This led her
> and her daughters, Bessie and Gladys, to become Bahà'is in 1910.63 In June of that year
> Viola Duckett arranged a public meeting in a schoolhouse in Sumerduck, Virginia, close
> to her home. It was attended by more than 100 people who heard the message of the
> Bahà’i Faith from Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Hannen, Bahà’is who lived in nearby Washington,
DC.64 Bahà’i meetings with the Hannens on the fourth Sunday o f each month continued
for three years.65

In 1912 the Ducketts attended a meeting in Washington, DC, to see and hear ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. Charles Mason Remey, a Bahà’i from Washington, DC, took the Ducketts to the
gathering and in a 1980 interview Bessie recalled meeting ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at a gathering of
children on that occasion. She remembered very clearly that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to her,
“You have had many blessings and will have many more.” Bessie told the interviewer that
her greatest blessing was her son, Kenneth, with whom she was living in Monrovia,
California, where the interview took place.66

After the Ducketts moved to Bisbee in 1915, they held weekly Bahà’i-related meetings
in their home.67 Sunday school classes were hosted for about twelve children but when the
subject o f “Bahà’i” was introduced, the parents went to their ministers for more
information and apparently they were advised not to allow their children to attend the
classes.68 Although the children still came to see Bessie, “because they loved me,” she
respectfully withheld further mention about the Bahà’i Faith. Bessie recalled the 1917 visit
of Mrs. Brittingham in Bisbee and that she was a guest in the Duckett home; also that
Ahmad Sohrab was a Bahà’i guest for two weeks in their home and spoke at the Bisbee
Y M C A .69 Neighbors of the Ducketts met and heard both o f the visiting Bahà’is speak
about the Faith. Bessie also recalled that a Bisbee resident at some point joined the ranks
o f the Faith.

Bessie’s cousin from Colorado, Elmore Eugene Duckett, and his family visited their
relatives in South Bisbee from time to time and it was during one o f these visits in 1915
that Bessie, aided by her mother, “convinced him [Elmore] o f the truth o f the Bahà’i
Faith.”70 Elmore’s father and brother also became Bahà’is.71 Bessie and Elmore were
married in Houston, Texas, on June 5, 1918,72 and they and Viola and Gladys moved to
Los Angeles in May 1922. They may have had friends or at least an interest in Los
Angeles as indicated in the July 6, 1921, issue o f the Bisbee Ore that notes: “Miss Gladys
Duckett is leaving today for Los Angeles for a three months’ visit in that city.” 73

Bessie stated in 1980 that there was no contact with Mrs. French when the Frenches
lived in Arizona during the period the Ducketts lived in South Bisbee and that she didn’t
meet Mrs. French until after they both had moved to California.74 In 1922, a Bahà’i whose
name Bessie couldn't recall in 1980, remained behind in Bisbee; they corresponded for a
number of years.75

It appears that other Bahà’is resided in isolated mining communities in Arizona during
those early days. In an article published in Star o f the West, June 5, 1912, a report from
Corinne True, financial secretary of Bahà’i Temple Unity, listed cities and towns from
which Bahà’i contributions had been received since the Convention o f 1911. One of two
towns listed in Arizona was Tombstone; the other was Morenci.76 In 1919 a supplication
to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá requesting Him to revisit America contained more than 1,000 signatures
of Bahà’is from the United States and Canada, and included two from Arizona— Alletta B.
Martin and Geo. E. Witte— under the heading o f “Wilcox, Ariz.”77 At that time Wilcox
was associated with cattle ranches and was an important cattle shipping center.

With the approach o f 1920, it was evident that Phoenix was developing into an
increasingly important center in Arizona and there were also signs that indicated its future
as an important center for the Faith from which other Arizona Bahà’i communities would
spring.

The United States enters the First World War in 1917.

During the summer o f 1917, the same year the Frenches moved from Douglas, Arizona, to
California, Edward and Amanda Ruppers and children moved to Phoenix79 and became the
first permanent Bahà’i residents in Phoenix. The Rupperses had accepted the Faith in the
early years of 190080 and before moving to Phoenix, Edward, Amanda and their four
children lived in Chicago where they were in the presence o f ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on a number of
occasions during His visit to that city in 1912. Mr. Ruppers’ account, undated, o f those
occasions is preserved in the Phoenix Bahà’i archives:81

> At the time o f ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s visit to America, I with my wife and four
> children resided at 4746 Langley Ave., Chicago. Living with us at the time
> was Mrs P.[aul] K.[ingston] Dealey [Dealy], Mrs. Dealey was totally blind,
> having met with a serious accident by falling off a high platform on[to] her
> back, injuring her spine. Mrs Dealey was a devout follower o f ‘Abdu’l-
> Baha, and had received several Tablets from Him while He was in the
> prison o f Acca.

> When we heard that ‘Abdu’l-Baha was to be in Chicago, and that he was
> to give an address in Drill Hall in the Masonic Temple, and were anxious to
> see and hear the one who became known to us as “the Master”, all the
> members o f my family including Mrs Dealey went early to the hall on that
> Sunday morning o f April 30th, 1912. We got seats in the third row from
> the front. There were seven o f us; I was sitting in the first seat from the
> end, then Mrs Ruppers with Nina82 on her lap, next sat Mrs Dealey, then
> the three boys. The hall soon became filled. Lua Getsinger was giving the
> preliminary talk prior to ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s arrival. Suddenly everyone in that
> hall arose as one person, for there on the threshold with his interpreters
> stood the Master. Every eye was turned towards that “Unusual, Majestic
> Personality; A World Commanding Figure had appeared for the Uplift,
> Unification, and Peace o f Mankind.”

> Majestically He walked to the rostrum, and with a gesture o f His hand,
> signaled the audience to be seated; then glancing over the assemblage. His

eyes fell on that o f Mrs Dealey. Like a flash He came down to where we
> were sitting and reaching across Mrs. Ruppers and I, He grasped both o f
> Mrs. Dealey's hands in His, saying: “O Mrs. Dealey, so happy am I to see
> you, so very happy.” She was so thoroughly overcome that she couldn't
> utter a word for a few moments, then with tears streaming down her
> cheeks she said, “O, ‘Abdu’l-Baha, I am so happy to be so near you. Will I
> ever be able to see again?” He answered: “Physically, no, but spiritually
> you will see wondrous things.”83 At that he returned to the rostrum and
> delivered about a 20-minute talk. I marvelled at the time, and have often
> wondered since; how could he know and pick out Mrs Dealey out o f that
> vast audience, not ever having seen her before.

> The next day was the dedication o f the Temple [Bahà’i House o f Worship]
> grounds, and the laying o f the Temple comer stone. It was a cheerless day,
> cold wind blowing off the lake, yet quite a crowd was there for the
> occasion.

> The next day Mrs Ruppers and I called on ‘Abdu’l-Baha at his suite in the
> Plaza Hotel. He welcomed us with outstretched arms, and asked us a few
> questions. Then He said to Mrs. R. [uppers], “You have been in very poor
> health, but your health will be much better for some years to come.” (Her
> health was much better as he had predicted.) Then after giving us His
> blessing with His hand on each o f our heads and then a fatherly embrace to
> each o f us, we left His Holy Presence. To me, it was a great joy and
> privilege to have talked with Him, and to have had that loving close contact
> with Him. My family had the joy of being with Him on another occasion
> when the children gathered in the Plaza Gardens to meet with Him.

> I had the pleasure o f hearing Him give two more addresses - one before the
> Theosophical Society, and another at the All Saints Church.

The Rupperses not only welcomed visiting Bahà’is to give the message o f the Bahà’i
Faith in their Phoenix home, but Mrs. Ruppers is described as being “aflame with the love
o f the Cause” and she “lost no time in speaking o f it in her modest w ay... .”84

Their first Bahà’i visitors arrived in 1918;85 they were Mrs. Corinne True86 with two of
her daughters, Edna and Katherine.87 They spent the winter in Phoenix during a period
when Mrs. True whose life and energies were dedicated to the development of the Bahà’i
House of Worship outside o f Chicago, was actively involved in various aspects o f its early
stages. Also visiting that winter were Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Gift, Bahà’is from Peoria,
Illinois,88 who would spend several more winters in Phoenix. On this occasion, however,
Mrs. Gift and Corinne True spoke at meetings held in the Phoenix home o f the Rupperses
and at the Phoenix Theosophical Center. In addition, Mr. and Mrs. Gift visited Douglas
and spoke to small groups.89

Support and reinforcement o f the Rupperses’ teaching efforts continued in 1919 when
> Amanda Ruppers’ sister. Miss Josephine Nelson, a Baha’i, arrived in Phoenix to live with
the Ruppers family.90

The year 1919 finds Nellie French and her mother, Mrs. Stevison, in Pasadena,
California, where they, with Mr. French, had moved in 1917. It was from there that both
Nellie French and her mother signed the 1919 supplication appealing to ‘Abdu’l-Baha to

> re-visit America.91 Amelia Collins and her husband had moved to Massachusetts.92
> According to her sister-in-law, Amelia attended Baha’i meetings in Pasadena, California,
> when she and her husband spent the winters there. It was there that Amelia heard about
the Faith from former Arizonan, Nellie French.93 Amelia became a Bahà’i in 191994 in
Pasadena, as previously noted; she and her husband eventually moved there.95

From 1919 to 1926, Amelia’s brother Oscar Engelder and his wife Louetta, not yet
Bahà’is, lived in Jerome, Arizona, where Amelia’s husband had a financial investment in
Jerome’s United Verde Extension Copper Mine.96 Oscar worked at the United Verde Mine

as a mining engineer. Louetta and Oscar Engelder would become Bahà’is in the 1940s in
the Greater Phoenix area where they were long-time residents. Amelia Collins lived with
them in their Phoenix area home for some years following the death o f her husband in

1937 and later stayed there during her periodic visits to Phoenix. Amelia Collins visited
Jerome two times during the period her brother and sister-in-law lived there. Upon her
arrival in Jerome in November 1921, Amelia was observed by her sister-in-law to be
unusually and uncharacteristically sad. Amelia explained that when she stepped off the
train in Prescott on her way to Jerome, she received word that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had died in
Haifa, Palestine (now Israel). Years later, Louetta Engelder recalled having been puzzled
at the time about “Milly’s” deep concern and grief over someone who had died in far-off
Haifa and that Milly said many prayers on the slopes o f Jerome on that occasion.97

The previous year, 1920, Viola Duckett o f Bisbee and John W. Gift (winter visitor in
Phoenix) were listed as delegates to the Twelfth Annual Mashrekal Azkar (Bahà’i)
Convention in New York representing, respectively, the communities o f Bisbee and
Phoenix.98 The matter o f delegates was evolving as indicated in a report o f the Convention
published in Star o f the West in 1920:99 “It was thereupon moved that not only at future
Conventions, but at this Convention any delegate representing more than one assembly
should have but one vote in the Convention”100 (emphasis added).

An article in the November 1930 issue o f Bahá 7 News provides some clarification about
the matter o f delegates: “With the institution o f the local Spiritual Assemblies in localities
having nine believers or more, as instructed by Shoghi Effendi, the National Spiritual
Assembly could no longer recognize as Bahà’i bodies those smaller local groups which
under the by-laws o f Bahà’i Temple Unity had enjoyed a status equal to that possessed by
believers in centers able to elect a Spiritual Assembly.”101

By 1920, in addition to Bahà’is residing in Bisbee (the Ducketts and, likely, at least one
other person) and in Phoenix (the Ruppers family and Miss Josephine Nelson plus winter
visitors Mr. and Mrs. John W. Gift), and a few other Arizona localities, some of which
have been mentioned, Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Robarts resided in Kelvin, Arizona, (Cochran
mail)102 located in Pinal County. They gave the Bahà’i message as opportunity arose.103

During 1921, a Dr. Fisher was in Phoenix where he made his home for a brief time and
Mr. and Mrs. Charles Q. Adams and family moved to Phoenix from Denver and

contributed considerably to the teaching work.104 The Adamses received a Tablet from
‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent in care of Roy Wilhelm105 for forwarding to their Phoenix residence.
They later sent it to the National Assembly.106 In April o f 1921, Nellie French and her
husband (not a Bahà’i) visited Haifa and ‘Akká (now in Israel) where Nellie met ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and members o f the Holy Family.107 This pilgrimage to the Holy Land undoubtedly
provided her with first-hand information for a presentation two years later at the annual
convention of the Arizona Federation o f Women’s Clubs.108

More support and reinforcement o f the teaching work in Phoenix occurred when Louis
Gregory visited in 1922.109 Mr. Gregory, an African-American, had participated in the first
BaháM (Race) Amity Convention held in Washington, DC, in 1921, organized by Agnes
Parsons at the request o f ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.n0 It spawned interracial amity meetings in Bahà’i
communities throughout the U S.111 including in Phoenix in the 1930s.

During his 1922 visit in Phoenix, Mr. Gregory spoke at daily meetings in the Ruppers
home; also at a morning and evening service at Tanner Chapel112 at the invitation o f the
minister. Tanner Chapel, located at 20 S. Eighth Street, was described during their 1986
centennial celebration as the oldest black congregation in Arizona that had originally
struggled for existence in a region o f the country populated by few blacks.113 The church
that welcomed Mr. Gregory was part o f the African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.)
denomination and Mr. Gregory appears to be the first Bahà’i to personally contact
African-American residents in Phoenix about the Faith.

While Phoenix was becoming firmly-rooted as a Bahà’i focal center, Bisbee, where it all
began, was one o f several small Bahà’i communities addressed in a letter from Shoghi
Effendi early in his ministry and which was printed in Star o f the West, May 1923:

> The beloved o f the Lord and the handmaids o f the Merciful in Asbury Park, N.J.;
> Augusta, Ga.; Beverly Salem, Mass.; Bisbee, Ariz. [emphasis added]. Care o f the
> members o f the National Spiritual Assembly.
Dearest Fellow-workers in the Vineyard o f God:

Though your number in each o f these cities be small and limited, yet by
> virtue o f that Celestial Potency bequeathed to every one o f you by our departed
> Master [‘Abdu'1-Bahá], you are assured that ere long your small company shall
> expand and wield such power and influence as no earthly power can ever hope for
> or attain. Who can doubt that he is ever watching from his Station on High over
> his scattered fold and is guiding and strengthening his faithful lovers who toil and
> labour for the fulfillment o f his Word and the realization o f his Purpose for
mankind?....

I very eagerly await the news o f the progress o f the Movement in your cities
> and shall be grateful and delighted to hear that you have reinforced your numbers,
> extended your activities, established a centre and founded a Spiritual Assembly
that shall direct and co-ordinate your efforts for the promotion o f the Cause.

Awaiting your joyful news and beseeching the blessings o f the Almighty
upon your efforts.

I am your brother and co-worker,

{Signed) SHOGHI.

It appears that Bisbee had a Local Spiritual Assembly sporadically in the 1980s (e g.,
1982 and 1988, but not in 1986 and 1987, according to available records115 ) but the
present compiler’s recollection is that Bisbee didn’t have a sufficient number o f Bahà’is to
form a Local Assembly either before or after that period to the present time (year 2004).

In 1923 Nellie French, former Arizona resident, visited Phoenix where she was a guest
in the home o f Mrs. Charlotte Ellis for three days."6 Mrs. French spoke about the Bahà’i
Faith to a group of prominent women"7 in a private home, and at a public meeting
arranged by Mrs. Ruppers and the Gifts at the Woman’s Club building where she
addressed “quite a large audience.” "8 She also attended the Twenty-First Annual
Convention o f the Arizona Federation o f Women’s Clubs held in Prescott, April 4-7,"9
where she mentioned the Bahà’i Faith publicly and where two or three individuals sought
more information, among them Miss Sharlot Hall.120 (Miss Hall was named poet o f the
Arizona Federation of Women’s Clubs at their 1923 convention.121 She was also the first
Territorial Historian o f Arizona, appointed in 1909, and she founded the Sharlot Hall
Museum in Prescott in 1928.122)

During the 1923 convention o f the Arizona Federation o f Women’s Clubs, an evening
banquet on April 5th was dedicated to State Federation presidents and Nellie addressed
the audience on the topic “Shrines o f the Holy Land.”123 She most likely drew upon travel
experiences during the time o f her Bahà’i pilgrimage to Haifa and ‘Akká in 1921. She
spoke on the same subject at a meeting o f Prescott’s Rotary Club and placed some books
in the Prescott Public Library.124

That same year another former Arizona resident, Amelia Collins, also returned to visit
Phoenix and Prescott in addition to Jerome. At each place, she spoke to individuals about
the Faith and she, too, donated books to the Prescott library.125

By 1924 the Bahà’i children's magazine, The Children o f the              , went to three
homes in Arizona.126

In 1926 Phoenix received Bahà’i visitors, Mr. and Mrs. Howard McNutt from New
York (he prepared the compilation o f ‘Abdu’l-Bahà’s talks published as Promulgation
Universal Peace), accompanied by their friend Julia Grundy (author o f Ten Days in the
Light o f Acca, originally published ca. 1907).127 Mr. McNutt spoke at several meetings
held in private homes.128

As the foundation o f the Faith was becoming rooted in Phoenix, a significant expansion
and consolidation was about to occur at the end o f the decade.

In the 1930s the Great Depression gripped the United States and

> The years 1929 and 1930 were particularly significant years for the Bahà’i Faith in both
> Phoenix and Arizona. In January 1929, Bahà’is Orcella Rexford (Louise Cutts-Powell)131
> and Dr. Gayne Gregory, her husband and business manager, came to Phoenix for Miss
Rexford to give her series o f paid lectures that could last several weeks.132

Among her published materials were manuals, two o f which were titled Advanced
Course o f Names and              ,N
bers and Cities and Their Vibrations - Where To Live, and

> u
> one o f her books was titled Your Name and You. Does Your Name Spell Dollars?™ She
> also wrote a number of articles for the Bahà’i magazine, World Order, some o f which
> were reprinted as Bahà’i pamphlets, for example, The Art o f Tranquillity and Radiant
Acquiescence.134

Miss Rexford earned her living as “a teacher of psychology and healing,” giving paid
lectures throughout the United States to large audiences of several hundred to one
thousand.135 At the end o f her lecture series, she would offer her classes a free lecture on a
topic that she said was far greater than anything she had already presented. This particular
lecture embodied the message o f the Bahà’i Faith and at the conclusion, the audience was
informed that anyone interested and attracted was invited to a series of free lectures that
would be given by a Bahà’i teacher.136 (A later policy altered this method of Bahà’i
teaching. See APPENDIX 2, pages 58-59, for details.)

In Phoenix on March 15, 1929, Miss Rexford concluded a six weeks paid course of
lectures and study classes and offered her students her usual final free lecture. In the
afternoon o f the following Sunday, March 17,137 she presented her free lecture on the
Bahà’i topic “God's Great Message for the New Day” at the Masonic Temple to an
audience o f some 450 people that included students from her paid lecture series and the
general public.138

At an evening lecture on the same day, she presented “pictures” (slides?) o f the Holy
Land including scenes o f Haifa and ‘Akká and one o f the Bahà’i House o f Worship that
was in the early stages o f construction outside o f Chicago. At the close o f her presentation
she announced the formation o f a class to study the Bahà’i teachings and invited all who
were interested to meet the following evening at the Phoenix Woman’s Club building
located at Second Avenue and Filmore Street. Bahà’i books had been placed for sale at
the rear o f the room—Abdul Baha on Divine Philosophy, The Divine Art o f Living (Mary

Rabb, compiler), and Paul Kingston Dealy’s booklet Dawn o f Knowledge and the Most
Great          aceP

; about twenty-five copies o f each were sold.139
On the evening o f Monday, March 18, about seventy-five people responded and met for
> the formation o f the Bahà’i study class at the Woman’s Club building that had been rented
> for ten dollars per week. After a brief talk, Miss Rexford introduced her Bahà’i friend,
> Edwinna Powell, who had come from La Jolla, California, to conduct the classes on
> Monday and Thursday evenings. All those interested in joining the study class or who
> wanted to receive notices of Bahà’i lectures were asked to sign cards giving their names
and addresses; sixty-eight cards were handed in.140

Since the following Thursday evening was set aside for the celebration o f Naw-Rúz
> (Bahà’i New Year), Miss Rexford extended an invitation to all present and any o f their
> friends, to attend what she characterized as a meeting in which social and spiritual features
would be combined and there would be a “party.” Among the approximately 125 who

> came were many strangers who apparently came out o f curiosity or to enjoy the party and
> refreshments. The program included a brief presentation on Naw-Rúz by Miss Rexford
and another on “The Báb” by Mrs. Powell.141

The first scheduled study class on Monday, March 25, was attended by thirty-five
persons, most o f whom were in their early twenties. The class consisted o f a presentation
on the topic o f “Bahà’u’ilàh” as well as readings, questions and discussion, with the
pamphlet Bahá ’u ’lláh and His Message being distributed to all at the end o f the session.142

On the following Thursday evening, March 28 (“a rainy evening”), the second scheduled
class was attended by twenty-two persons and the topic was “ ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.” This time
the book             Bahá ’u ’lláh

a nd the New Era was offered for sale and twenty copies were
sold.143 While attendance varied slightly, a core group of approximately twenty-eight
committed individuals joined the on-going study class.144

Weekly classes were conducted by Mrs. Powell for about six weeks145 and covered a
variety o f Bahà’i topics with presentations and elaborations on, for example, “What it
Means to be a Believer” and “The Local Spiritual Assembly— its requirements, aims, its
methods and its desirability.”146 Some classes consisted o f presentations by students who
were assigned such subjects as: The Proclamation, The Message of the Báb, Bahà’u’ilàh,
The Divine Plan, Oneness o f Religion, Oneness of Mankind, and Elimination of
Prejudice.147

At an appropriate time, an opportunity was provided for the students to express their
interest in identifying themselves as Bahà’is. Twenty-one adults and three youth responded
affirmatively; three others also responded affirmatively but were in Phoenix temporarily
and actually resided elsewhere, so apparently were advised that their enrollments needed
to be submitted through Bahà’i administrative channels where they lived.148 The core group
was comprised o f an almost equal number o f men and women.149

Mrs. Powell reported that during her six weeks in Phoenix, in addition to conducting the
classes, she gave private interviews lasting from one to three hours with twenty-seven
people, visited in homes or had luncheon with eleven more, held several small group
meetings in her room, and attended two picnics— one attended by twenty-nine people, the
other by twenty-four— where the Faith was explained.150

Before she left Phoenix in April, her enthusiastic students met together and with Mrs.

Powell presiding, elected officers and a Program Committee to organize plans for future

activities o f the class.151 After Mrs. Powell returned to her home in California, the group’s
weekly study classes were held in the home o f two of her students, Clinton and Miriam
Bugbee152 at 1738 West Van Buren Street153 and continued for two years; all the Nineteen
Day Feasts were observed.154

Edwinna Powell and Orcella Rexford both corresponded with this fledgling group of
Baha’is for many years and made occasional return visits.155

On May 5, 1929, John Bosch and George Latimer were returning to the West Coast
following their attendance at the Bahà’i National Convention in Wilmette, Illinois. They

stopped off in Phoenix, met the Bahà’is, presented a report o f the Conventioa and
attended a picnic supper arranged in their honor.156

In June, the secretary o f the Phoenix group wrote to Orcella Rexford and reported that
the average attendance at their meetings was thirty and many were asking for more
meetings.157

Miss Josephine Nelson, who moved to Phoenix in 1919 to live with her sister Amanda
Ruppers and family, had left Phoenix at some point and moved back to Phoenix in

September 1929 from Los Angeles with her mother.158 During this period of her residency
in Phoenix, Miss Nelson along with her mother and Amanda Ruppers, donated some
books that created the foundation o f a Bahà’i library for their small group.159

Miss Nelson also started a weekly evening Esperanto160 class held at the High School
and most of the members o f the Bahà’i study class attended it.161 Bahà’u ’ilàh enjoins the
adoption o f a universal auxiliary language162 and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had praised Esperanto as
having “all the potential qualities” o f becoming an international language.163 Over the years
many Bahà’is have supported Esperanto in the spirit o f Bahà’u ’ilàh’s directive and
Josephine Nelson obviously was one o f its supporters.

Elizabeth Greenleaf,164 one o f the early American Bahà’is, spent most of the winter of
1929 and early spring o f 1930 in Phoenix working with the study class and helped prepare
the group to become a Bahà’i community with a Local Spiritual Assembly.165 Mrs.
Greenleaf was known to be modest about her “beautiful talks”166 and in Phoenix her
inspiring presentations included Bahà’i administration.167By December 1929, two to three
and four meetings per week were being held including the Esperanto classes and Feasts.168
In a letter dated December 17, 1929, Mrs. Greenleaf wrote that she had received a number
o f inquirers with questions about the Faith and that there were enough confirmed believers
to form a good working Local Spiritual Assembly.169

The National Spiritual Assembly had requested the Regional Teaching Committee— the
Pacific Coast Teaching Committee— through Leroy Ioas170 o f San Francisco, to keep in
touch with the Phoenix Bahà’is171 and before the close o f 1929, Mr. Ioas assumed personal
responsibility for this. He provided additional support o f the teaching and consolidation
when he and his wife made a brief visit to Phoenix on Sunday, December 15.172 Their eager
friends met the Ioases’ train when it came into Phoenix at 6:30 A .M .— the Ioases were not
even up yet. Members o f the Bahà’i study group greeted and accompanied Mr. and Mrs.
Ioas until they again boarded the train late that night.173 In the afternoon, Mr. Ioas had
addressed an enthusiastic and interested audience at the Woman’s Club House where a
photograph of the attendees with the Ioases was taken on the steps o f the Club House.174
In the evening he gave a talk at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Bugbee that he began by
showing “the moving pictures o f ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.”175 Mr. Ioas and his wife left Phoenix by

train around 11:20 P.M.176 and were seen off by many o f the friends who, Mrs. Greenleaf
reported, “were talking o f plans for the next visit o f this young man who seemed to them
and to me a tower o f light.”177

Mrs. Greenleaf went to Long Beach, California, to spend an extended Christmas period
with her son. She returned the latter part o f January 1930 and resumed her work with the
Phoenix Bahà’i group.178 Also in January, Curtis Kelsey o f New York arrived for a two-
week’s visit and presented some inspiring and interesting talks179 that included his
experiences in Haifa180 and he showed his beautiful slides o f the Holy Land.181

On February 6, Mrs. Greenleaf wrote to a Bahà’i friend, Roland Estall, from the Apache
Hotel in downtown Phoenix:

> We have a stirring enthusiastic group in Phoenix which will be organized
> into an Assembly on April 21st. They hope to send a delegate to the
> Convention. ..the work is continually increasing here, so many questions
> coming up in the minds o f the friends concerning administration...There
> are also a number of people who, up to the present time, have not met with
> the group, so taken all in all it keeps me busy from morning until night
> almost every day. Once in awhile I run off to the desert and there in its
> glories and solitude, I find quiet and refreshment... 182

Kathryn Frankland,183 an active Bahà’i teacher from Berkeley, California, arrived in
Phoenix in February to lend assistance to Mrs. Greenleaf s services.184 On February 18,
Leroy Ioas returned for a visit along with John Bosch and Fred Schopflocher.185 The group
welcomed them and a Feast o f Attraction was held with about sixty people in
attendance.186

After being in Phoenix for almost five months, Mrs. Greenleaf concluded her services of
assisting the group for the next stage o f their collective Bahà’i development, and she left
Phoenix on April 14, 1930,187to continue her fruitful services to the Faith elsewhere.

By this time, the Phoenix group had been studying together for slightly over one year in
preparation for the next historic step they were about to take.

THE FIRST LOCAL SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY IN ARIZONA

IS FORMED 88

The following appeared in the Phoenix Evening Gazette on April 18, 1930, under the
large heading “LOCAL BAHAI GROUP TO FORM ASSEMBLY”

At a meeting o f the Bahai community o f Phoenix to be held Monday
> evening, beginning at 8 o ’clock, a local Assembly to be known as the Bahai
> Assembly o f Phoenix, affiliated with the National Bahai Assembly o f the
United States and Canada,189will be organized....

Thirty members are enrolled in the Phoenix community which has been
staging regular meetings for more than a year as a study group.

The national assembly will meet in Chicago, April 24, 25 and 26, and
> several delegates from the Pacific coast cities will be in Phoenix on Easter
> Sunday speaking at a free public meeting to be held at the Woman's club
auditorium at 3 o ’clock in the afternoon....

The Bahai movement proclaims the time o f universal peace and provides
> the base for universal religion. It is not a new religious movement but is
> religion revivified and renewed.

A similar article appeared in the Arizona Republican newspaper (a few months later it
would be known as today’s                                   Arizona Republic).m

In anticipation o f this step, several fellow-Bahà’is from the West Coast on their way to
attend the National Convention in Wilmette, Illinois, stopped in Phoenix to offer their
services and witnessed the historic event. On April 20th, National Assembly member and
former Arizonan Nellie French, Louise Caswell, George Latimer, Leroy Ioas and his wife
Sylvia, and John Bosch all arrived for an evening meeting in the home o f Mr. and Mrs.
Bugbee.191 At this meeting with Mr. Latimer acting as chairman, the first Local Spiritual
Assembly in Arizona was formed— the Spiritual Assembly o f the Baha’is o f Phoenix.192

The Phoenix Bahà’is elected from among their number the following individuals to be
the nine members o f the Assembly: Clinton Bugbee, Miriam Bugbee, Emma Jacobs, Wm.
V. McCoy, Amanda Ruppers, Nina Ruppers, Paul Schoeny, Pearl (later known as
“Zahrah”) Schoeny and Ross Seibert.193

Attached to Miriam Bugbee’s Bahà’i Historical Record card194 in the Phoenix Bahà’i
archives, is her photograph and also a photo o f the Bugbees’ home on the back o f which
is written: “First Baha'i Assembly in the State o f Arizona [was] organized in this home
April 21, 1930. Residence o f Mr. and Mrs. C. H. Bugbee[,] 1738 West Van Buren St,
Phoenix, Ariz.” This home continued to be a site o f Bahà’i activities for many years.

> Any activities you plan which will not allow the new believers

> Phoenix. On May 2, 1930, Ella Cooper from San Francisco and Amelia Collins from
> Pasadena visited on their way home after attending the National Convention in Wilmette.
> They gave a report of the Convention at a picnic supper hosted for them.197 Mrs. Collins
> reported that cables and telegrams from all over the world had been read at the
> Convention including one sent to the Phoenix Assembly from Shoghi Effendi198 in response
to a cablegram sent to him following the election o f their Local Spiritual Assembly.199

Many o f the early Bahà’i visitors, whose contact and services were so valuable to the
Bahà'is in Phoenix, maintained close bonds with the Assembly, the community, and

> individual Bahà'is through repeated visits and correspondence. These deep spiritual bonds
> embodied a sincere interest and concern for the well being o f the individual Bahà’is, their
families and friends and, no doubt, contributed greatly to the sense o f Bahà’i family that
existed among the Bahà’is in Arizona.

The Phoenix Bahà’is showed positive and concrete response to this attention and
encouragement, and from the beginning participated in activities and programs instituted
for the establishment and progress o f the Faith. During the first year following the election
o f the Assembly, a study class was held every Monday evening and fruitful Feasts of
Attraction for inquirers were hosted throughout the year. Three Phoenix residents joined
the Faith that Bahà’i year and on January 12, 1931, a Feast o f Attraction was held in their
honor.200 Phoenix membership records that year also included Mrs. J. J. Patterson, San
Carlos Hotel, Yuma.201 (The following Bahà’i year, 1931-1932, two more residents
joined.202 In addition, Emma Maxwell Almonte, who had accepted the Faith in 1927 in
Honolulu, Hawaii, transferred her Bahà’i membership from Honolulu to the Phoenix
Bahà’i Community.203 )

In November 1930, the Phoenix Assembly had written to the regional West Coast
Teaching Committee stating, “The colored people of Phoenix have gone to the
G overnor... and requested him to appoint a committee for Amity work. He appointed five
colored people on the committee and was to appoint five white.” The Assembly “sent a
committee to call on him in regards to the white committee ...” hoping it would “make a
new opening for us.”204 In compliance with the Governor’s request, the Assembly put the
offer o f their services for the interracial amity work being planned, in a letter to him and
enclosed a piece o f literature explaining the Bahà’i principles. Apparently nothing came
from their offer but the Assembly continued pursuing interracial activity. In January 1931,

they changed the name o f the “Social Welfare Committee” to “Amity Committee”205 and
they persevered in promoting race amity as will be seen.

Phoenix Bahà’is showed an early interest in attending the Bahà’i Summer School at
Geyserville, California, and from the 1930s onward some regularly attended each
summer.206 The school was located on property offered by Mr. and Mrs. John Bosch and
they deeded it to the Bahà’i National Assembly in 1936.207 Mr. Bosch was among the
periodic Bahà’i visitors to Phoenix and he and his wife, Louise, kept in touch with Phoenix
Bahà’is through correspondence including personal notes on school announcements.208
Thirteen Bahà’is from Phoenix attended the Bahà’i School at Geyserville during the
summer o f 1933.209

The early history o f the Phoenix Bahà’i Community is linked with many luminaries of
the Faith, some o f whom have been mentioned. Another was Keith Ransom-Kehler210 who
visited for a week in March 1931 under the auspices o f the National Assembly and the
National Teaching Committee.2" Her schedule included speaking to gatherings of Bahà’is
and Baha’is-and-their-friends, in addition to ladies at the Phoenix Woman’s Club, an
interracial audience at the State Interracial Commission meeting at the Phoenix Union
High School, the Parent-Teacher Association at Emerson School, an audience o f 125 at a
public meeting at the Masonic Temple Auditorium (her topic: “The Great Message of
Bahà’u’ilàh”), and to youth at the “Colored Baptist Church.”212 She also made the first213
known Phoenix radio presentation by a Bahà’i, fifteen-minutes long on station KOY.214
Her talk before the State Interracial Commission put the local Assembly in touch with a
group of African-Americans, and the Assembly anticipated that this would prove o f value
when followed up.215

In May, Mrs. Ransom-Kehler wrote the Phoenix Assembly requesting ten more copies
o f the newspaper publicity regarding her Phoenix visit because she wanted to send a copy
as advance publicity to the various Assemblies she soon would be visiting in the Far East,
Middle East, Europe and elsewhere. She added that she considered the Phoenix publicity
articles as one of the most satisfactory write-ups that she’d had.216 The Phoenix Bahà’i
archives contains several letters from her. In one letter dated May 18, 1932, addressed to
the Spiritual Assembly o f the Bahà’is o f Phoenix and postmarked from India, she wrote
that she had remembered the members in prayers at the Shrine o f Bahà’u ’ilàh at Bahji
(then in Palestine). She died o f smallpox almost one and one-half years later in Persia
while on a mission for Shoghi Effendi to appeal to the Shah and Moslem clergy to end the
large-scale persecution o f Bahà’is. She was given the stations both o f a martyr (the first
American Baha’i martyr) and a Hand o f the Cause, by Shoghi Effendi following her death
in October 1933.217

Elected to the Phoenix Assembly in April 1931 were George Jacobs, chairman; Amanda
Ruppers, vice-chairman; Nina Ruppers, recording secretary; Ross Seibert, treasurer; Paul
Schoeny, librarian; Jennie Bowman, Annette Douglass, Miriam Bugbee and Walter Jones.
When Mrs. Bugbee withdrew because o f responsibilities as president o f the Phoenix
Woman’s Club, Clarence Iverson was elected to replace her on the Assembly218 and he was
appointed corresponding secretary.219

In anticipation o f the Twenty-third Annual Convention o f the National Assembly
scheduled for May 1931, a report in Bahá 7                                               Nelisted Phoenix as o
communities among a total of fifty with delegates.220 Phoenix was designated as having

two delegates, Clinton and Miriam Bugbee,221 but it appears that neither o f them attended
the gathering that year. George Latimer and John Bosch stopped in Phoenix one morning
on their way to the Convention and spoke to several groups before leaving in the
evening.222 Ella Cooper also stopped in Phoenix, afterwards, en route to her home in
California and presented a report o f the Convention.223

Early on, the firmly established Phoenix Bahà’i Community utilized the media, print and
radio, to proclaim the Faith and its teachings and to share news o f its activities. A May

1931 issue of The Arizona Gleam, a weekly newspaper224 that primarily served the
African-American community throughout the state, published a twenty-one column-inch
article under the heading “Construction o f Baha’i Temple Causes Inquiries” with a sub­
title “ ‘True Religion the Only Solu-[tion] to Race Problem’ Is the Baha’i Faith [sic].” It
quoted local Assembly member Ross Seibert and presented Baha’i views on racial matters
and included extensive statements made by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.225 At the National Convention
the following year, the secretary o f the National Teaching Committee reported that “the
progress o f the Temple and the work o f traveling teachers have drawn the attention of
people.”226

Edwinna Powell, one o f the instructors o f the study class in 1929, made a weeklong
return visit to Phoenix at the end o f May 1931 and gave the Bahà’is “a great deal of
inspiration” and answered many o f their questions.227 At a meeting in June, Mrs. Powell
said she thought there were too many meetings for one week and suggested combining
one o f them with a scheduled Feast o f Attraction.228

On January 16, 1932, Shahnaz Waite,229 a fellow-Bahà’i from Los Angeles, arrived in
Phoenix for a month-long stay. Her services were utilized almost daily at various Baha'i
meetings— sometimes more than one meeting a day— and included a series o f lessons she
had compiled from the Bahà’i writings.230 A brief report appeared in B ahd’i News
acknowledging the appreciation o f the Phoenix Bahà’is for the inspiration brought by this
beloved teacher. It also acknowledged visits from other Bahà’is including Mr. and Mrs.
Ioas o f San Francisco and stated, “Such visits are tremendously helpful and stimulating
and a great aid in the spread o f the Cause.”231 (According to Bahà’u ’ilàh, “The movement
itself from place to place when undertaken for the sake of God hath always exerted, and
can now exert, its influence in the world.”)232

In November 1931, the Phoenix Assembly had appointed a committee to “formulate a
children’s Sunday School.”233 The following January, a meeting for the children o f the
Bahà’i community was held and with Mrs. Waite’s help, a children’s group was organized
and the name “The Phoenix Garden” was chosen for it. The ages o f the five youngsters
present ranged from two to five years and during the social part o f the gathering, Mrs.
Waite entertained the children with some o f her musical compositions. Several Kodak
pictures were taken.234

Mrs. Waite also “conducted”235 the first Bahà'i marriage236 in Phoenix (and in Arizona) in
1932 when Walter Jones and Emma Maxwell Almonte were married on February 11th.237
Their life-long Bahà’i services together included serving as members o f the Phoenix
Assembly238 and later as members of the first Local Spiritual Assembly o f Glendale,
Arizona.

During Shahnaz W aite’s month-long visit, the regular weekly Bahà’i meetings were
modified to be more appropriate for individuals interested in learning about the Faith.239

Among those who attended was Mrs. Frances Howard who brought a friend.240 Mrs.
Howard was of African-American descent and would enroll as a Bahà’i in 1933.241 In 1932

> she hosted an afternoon meeting at her home with Shahnaz Waite who spoke to about
thirteen African-American women.242

There were no racial barriers in the Phoenix Bahà’i Community in an otherwise generally
segregated society. Open segregation o f blacks was practiced in Phoenix until the late

1940s.243 In 1930, the total population o f Phoenix was 48,118 o f which 1,118 were listed
> as “negroes.”244 A Phoenix survey reported that in 1940 Phoenix had “two negro
> elementary schools in addition to the Phoenix Union colored high school.245 Racial
> differentiation between the white and colored races seems to be an accepted fact in
> Phoenix... It might be said that Phoenix is practically free from racial conflicts... ”246 The
> survey also noted that racial segregation o f “negroes” extended to special swimming
> pools, sections reserved for them in theaters, “sleeping quarters, restaurants and soda
fountains.”247

Interracial harmony reflecting the Bahà’i principles o f the O N ENESS OF HUM ANITY,
> UNITY WITH DIVERSITY and ELIM INATION OF PREJUDICE OF ALL KINDS was evident in the
> formation o f an Amity Committee back in January 1931 by the Baha’is o f Phoenix.248 Such
activities became an important focus o f Bahà’i communities.

The natural sharing o f the Bahà’i Faith and its teachings was typical o f the early Phoenix
> residents who responded to it. This, combined with a vibrant, loving and unified Bahà’i
> community imbued with the Bahà’i spirit, adherence to the directives o f Shoghi Effendi
> and the National Assembly, appealing meetings and activities including those scheduled
> around visiting Bahà’is, and the extensive use of Bahà’i publicity and announcements in
the local newspapers, contributed considerably to the consolidation o f the early Phoenix
Baha’is, individually and collectively, and to the expansion o f the Bahà’i community.

The Arizona Gleam published a prominent article in the spring o f 1932 under the
> heading “Interracial Group Honored with Beautiful Party.” Hosted by Mr. and Mrs.
> (Frances) Howard, 726 E. Grant Street,249 the event was described as an afternoon Easter
> Sunday party and although no Bahà’i mention was made, one o f the two interracial
photographs showed Mrs. Howard with two of her guests— one was a Bahà’i, Kathryn
Frankland,250 visiting from Berkeley, California. Mrs. Frankland had assisted with
preparations for the formation o f the Phoenix Assembly in 1930, and Mrs. Frankland and
local Bahà’is, although not identified, can be recognized in the second larger-group
photo.251

Another article in The Arizona Gleam reported Kathryn Frankland’s visit in March to
the Phoenix Union Colored High School and was captioned “Bahai Representative
Lectures to Students o f High School.”252 The article stated that “An inspiring address was
delivered to the student body...by Mrs. Kathryn Franklin [Frankland] (white)...taking as
her subject, ‘The Unity of Mankind’ ” and that she “went to the very depths o f science for
a few minutes. Some call the universal law God, some call it nature, but man has never
been able to understand that law, but when you catch the spirit you cannot let it go. It is a
live wire.” Her presentation was also “interspersed with bits o f humor” and was obviously
well received because at the conclusion it received loud applause.253

Plans o f the 1932-1933 National Teaching Committee included an appeal to “enkindle
the enthusiasm o f all Bahà’i workers, and give free rein to initiative in serving the

BaM’is and others at a party on Easter Sunday 1932 at the Phoenix home of Frances

Waite along with “three lovely pieces o f poetry she had composed.”257

Walter Jones was elected the Phoenix delegate to the 1932 Bahà’i National
> Convention258 but did not attend. However, Phoenix was among various cities at home and
abroad that sent messages o f loving greetings to the Convention.259

It was noted in May that contact had been made with about ten African-American
> individuals in Phoenix who had shown considerable interest in the teachings of
> Bahà’u’ilàh260 and a Feast o f Attraction that same month was attended by an interracial
group o f seven African-Americans and thirty-seven Caucasians.261

During the year early April 1932 to early April 1933, Phoenix held weekly study classes
> that included a course o f thirty-six lessons recommended by the National Assembly262 in
> addition to a twice-monthly study o f Shoghi Effendi’s recent translation o f        Dawn-
> Breakers™—Nabil’s narrative o f the early days o f the Bahà’i Revelation— first published
> in 1932. In a cablegram dated November 2, 1931, Shoghi Effendi had urged a
> concentrated study o f the soon to be published book “as essential preliminary to renewed
> intensive Teaching Campaign necessitated by completion o f Mashriqu’l-Adhkàr [Bahà’i
House o f Worship], Strongly feel widespread use o f its varied rich and authentic material

constitutes most effective weapon to meet challenge o f a critical hour.”264 As always, the
Phoenix Bahà’is had responded promptly to Shoghi Effendi’s appeal.

Also during the year, meetings o f the children’s group (The Phoenix Garden) were
attended by five girls, two o f whom were from non-Bahá’í homes.265 A Young People’s
Group that was started for older children in January 1932 by Shahnaz Waite266 met twice a
month and their meetings, centered around “Principles o f the Teachings,” were usually
attended by seven youth.267 The Esperanto classes started by Josephine Nelson continued
to be held and in September it was reported they were attended by seven to ten Bahà’is.268

Early in 1933 the Assembly had received a program o f Bahà’i lectures given in Los
Angeles by Ruth Moffett of Chicago and the Assembly decided to try and get her to come
to Phoenix.269 They were successful in their efforts and welcomed her in April.270 Mrs.
Moffett was an accomplished Bahà’i lecturer, teacher and writer and she presented a series
o f public lectures on April 11 and 12 sponsored by the Phoenix Assembly. Within a
twenty-four hour period, she gave seven lectures271 including to audiences at the Junior

College Auditorium, the Woman’s Club and the YWCA; she also presented an evening
> broadcast on radio station KTAR.272 Specific lecture topics included “A New Outlook on
> World Problems,” “The Cause o f the Rise and Fall o f Civilizations,” “The Evolution of the
> Christian Bible and Its Effect on Present Day Thinking” and the general topic o f “World
Problems.”273

Activities during the year also included continued race amity gatherings. In February
> 1933, Nina Ruppers (member o f a one-person Amity Committee in 1932-1933274 and
> chairman o f the four-member Committee in 1933-1934)275 had reported starting “a study
> class with the colored people.”276 She hosted a weekly afternoon Bahà’i study class for an
> interracial group o f thirteen individuals interested in the Faith. African-American members
> o f the group hosted some events for the Bahà’i community—Lucy Lucas hosted the
> celebration of the Declaration o f the Báb at her home on May 23 with thirty-nine people
> present, and Mrs. (Noble) Mathew White hosted an interracial (“equal number o f colored
> and whites”) social gathering at her home on May 25 consisting o f music, readings and
> refreshments.277 By September it was reported that the Assembly agreed to a request of
> several members of the afternoon interracial study class who wanted to attend the weekly
> study meetings held for Bahà’is so they could have the privilege o f studying “the
Administration.”278 When the question arose regarding some who wanted to become
members of the Bahà’i community, the Assembly decided they should first study “the
Administration” for the next few meetings.279 Several of them were getting anxious to
officially be accepted as Bahà’is.280

In June, the Phoenix Assembly implemented a weekly “Training Class for Teachers” to
prepare participants to present Bahà’i talks about the Faith.281 Also in June, Walter Jones
reported that two people who lived in or near Glendale were interested in the Faith.282

That summer, thirteen Phoenix Bahà’is, including children and youth, attended the
Bahà’i Summer School in Geyserville, California, traveling caravan-style in three cars. The
interracial makeup o f the four women occupants (two “colored” and two “white”) o f one
car was significant enough to note in a report to the National Assembly that they were
treated with every courtesy during their travel o f some 2,000 miles, and although
representing two races, they had no trouble in being admitted to “auto courts.”283

On July 4, 1933, an amity dinner was held at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Ruppers with
thirty-one individuals present.284 A special “amity or social meeting” held in September for
a group o f Moslems was attended by twenty-two people; seven were visitors. A
presentation about the Bahà’i Faith and its principles was made and one o f the guests
translated for the other Moslems.285

The Phoenix Bahà’is had responded significantly for a relatively young Bahà’i Assembly
and community o f its size— and still under the depressed economic conditions o f the Great
Depression—to the “Plan o f Unified Action” (1926-1928; 1931-c. 1933), an American-
initiated campaign to collect enough money to continue building the Bahà’i House of
Worship at Wilmette, Illinois.286 There was a flow o f appeals from Shoghi Efendi and the
National Assembly for unabated financial support, especially for the “New Plan o f Unified
Action” implemented in July 1931 by the National Assembly to complete the Bahà’i
Temple (it was dedicated in a public ceremony in May 1953)287 and promote the Cause in
America.288 In a message from Shoghi Effendi in 1932, he wrote that eyes o f countless
people in the East and the West were fixed upon the Temple “eager and expectant to

know whether the growing vicissitudes and the successive crises” afflicting America “are
such as to deflect the American believers from their high purpose or paralyze their
efforts.. .Ours is the duty to vindicate the vitality and invincible power of our Faith.”289
For a community o f approximately thirty Bahà’is during the Bahà’i year 1931 to 1932,
$282.00 was contributed from Phoenix.290 This slightly more than met the estimated
average monthly donation of $9.00 from every Bahà’i to meet the National Assembly’s
expenses that included construction costs o f the Bahà’i House o f Worship.291

In the fall o f 1932, the National Assembly had stated that reports indicated a great
forward movement was taking place in the promulgation o f the Faith.292 Phoenix
experienced this to some degree but Phoenix and Arizona were about to experience a
surge of forward movement in the fall o f 1933.

> Mr. Mathew and Mrs. Noble White. Madame Orlova was one o f sixty interracial guests at
the party where many wore costumes and she was one o f four who won a prize.296

On October 28 and 31, special meetings o f the Phoenix Assembly were held to meet

> and Mrs. White who had hosted the Halloween party the previous evening. They were
among the first African-American residents of Phoenix to embrace the Faith.298

In 1980, Lillie Wiggins was identified by Patricia Harris (formerly Patricia Smith) as the
first African-American resident in Phoenix to become a Bahà’i.299 Patricia Harris also
recalled that Lillie Wiggins lived at 12th Street and Moreland300 before Phoenix was
developed in that area and when the city's development expanded there, attempts were
made to have Mrs. Wiggins move because she was African-American. However, Mrs.
Wiggins’ neighbors (who were not Bahà’is) came to her aid because “they loved and
respected her.” Housing segregation o f blacks in Phoenix continued through the 1950s
with some progress made toward improving their housing in the late 1940s and early
1950s.301

Joining Lillie Wiggins as being among the first African-Americans to embrace the Faith
in Phoenix were Frances Howard and Mathew White;302 also Emma Gardner, Lucy Lucas,
and Noble (Mrs. Mathew) White, all in 1933.303 Mathew White’s Bahà’i Historical Record
card reveals he “was attracted to the Movement by Mrs. Lillie Wiggins, and I love the
order very much.” Frances Howard’s Historical Record card states she was attracted “by
the sincerness [sic] o f the members. I had a great test, and I received a blessing that
enables me to serve humanity.” (When Mrs. Wiggins died in March 1934, a brief
announcement reporting her death appeared on the front page o f The Arizona Gleamm

noting that her funeral services were “conducted by members o f the Bahai movement and
Order of the Eastern Star.”305 The very first Bahà’i funeral service conducted in Phoenix

[and in Arizona] was for Robert Edgar o f Buckeye who died in February 1932.306 Shahnaz
Waite conducted his funeral service during her month-long stay in Phoenix.)307

In November 1933, Madame Orlova stated she had spoken to over 300 people in
> Arizona and felt a Center was necessary. The enrollment o f Bahà’is and the expanded
> number attending meetings, including the Nineteen Day Feasts, led to the opening o f a
> Bahà'i Center located in the Arizona Fire Building at 210 West Adams Street308 where
> Room 16 was rented for $12.50 per month.309 By December it was decided to hold all the
regular meetings at the Bahà’i Center310 and this included meetings on Tuesday, Friday and

> Sunday nights for Bahà’is and “seekers” to deepen on various Bahà’i subjects.311 The
> Center was open to the public six days a week.312 The very first meeting at the Center took
> place in November313 with presentations on the Faith made by Madame Orlova and Mrs. A.
> Y. (Mamie) Seto.314 Arrangements had been made for Mrs. Seto o f San Francisco to
> conduct a new study class beginning the latter part of November for one month.315 Also in
> November, the 116th anniversary of the Birth o f Bahà’u ’ilàh was commemorated with a
> special public meeting held at the Phoenix YWCA building. Music was provided in
> addition to a presentation by Madame Orlova on the topic of “Bahà’u’ilàh.”316 Later that
> month the “Fête Day o f ‘Abdu’l-Bahá” (later re-named Day o f the Covenant)317 was
celebrated with a picnic dinner at the home o f one o f the Bahà’is— 65 people attended.318

During her visit, in addition to consulting with the local Assembly, speaking at events
for Bahà’is and at gatherings o f Bahà’is and their friends,319 Madame Orlova addressed
audiences at the YWCA, Beth Israel Synagogue, a group o f about sixty young Jewish
people, the Dons Luncheon Club, Literary Department o f the W oman’s Club, the student
body at the State Teacher’s College,320 students at “Phoenix Colored High School,” the
W oman’s Club in Glendale, and many meetings arranged in homes.321 She also did some
Bahà’i teaching in the prison at Florence, Arizona, where one young man was enrolled as
a Bahà’i and as a member o f the Phoenix community.322 This was accomplished at a special
meeting of the Phoenix Assembly held in the prison courtyard and was followed by a lunch
together, to get better acquainted with the young man.323 The National Assembly
acknowledged the enrollment o f the prisoner and encouraged continued loving contact
with him, but also suggested caution “in assuming any direct responsibility for the future
conduct of this man before the Board o f Pardons.”324 (It should be noted that according to
current policy [year 2004], “The National Spiritual Assembly feels that it is in the best
interest o f the Faith in the United States at this time to discourage Spiritual Assemblies,
committees and individual believers from initiating teaching projects in prisons.”)325 After
the enrollment of the prisoner, the Phoenix Bahà’is visited Florence, periodically, where
they held informal gatherings including picnics. They also kept in touch with Leslie
Greenshaw, brother o f Phoenix Bahà’i Miriam Bugbee (she enrolled as a Bahà’i with the
1929-1930 group); Mr. Greenshaw was homesteading as a prospector in the area.326

Madame Orlova spoke about the Faith to groups in various other locales in Arizona,
including Buckeye, Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Peoria and Tempe. During one o f her visits
to the Mormon Temple in Mesa, she spoke “to the President, two Vice-presidents and two
Bishops for five hours on the Bahà’i Cause.”327

Bahà’i Historical Record cards were first distributed to Local Assemblies, Groups and Isolated BaM ’is in 1935. The Phoenix
BaháT archives has about fifteen o f these completed by early Phoenix BaháTs.

The Bahà’i National Teaching Committee reported that Madame Orlova’s visit included
> eleven talks on the Faith “in the Mormon Church” in Mesa and that study classes were
> conducted for the visitors at two resorts in the Phoenix area; one was at the Arizona
> Biltmore, the other at Jokake Inn.* “People from all parts of America were attracted and
> on returning to their homes will become voting members o f Assemblies in those cities.
> Demonstrating how the efforts o f every one will, if selflessly offered, bear fruit, the
> teaching achievement in these exclusive resorts was brought about through the services of
> a colored Bahà’i, seamstress [probably Lucy Lucas]328 at one o f the hotels, who made
contacts for Madame Orlova with those for whom she worked.” 329

In March 1934, the month Madame Orlova was to leave Phoenix, Nellie French visited
> again and spent two days while Madame Orlova was still there,330 and Florence
> Schopflocher (Mrs. Seigfried Schopflocher) visited for a few days and gave instructive
talks on Bahà’i administration.331 Also in March, Walter Jones reported progress in a
Bahà’i study class in the Jonses’ home in Glendale.332

Between April 21, 1933 and April 21, 1934 a total of approximately twenty-two
> individuals were enrolled as Bahà’is by the Phoenix Assembly333 and 115 meetings were
> held, excluding Assembly meetings and public lectures by various Bahà’i traveling
teachers.334 Also during this period, records indicate there were Bahà’is in the following

areas: Bisbee (Mr. and Mrs. H. R. Lillywhite335), Douglas (Rex Rice), Kelvin (Mr. and
Mrs. Robarts), Lowell (Emily Keeler), Scottsdale (Walter P. Smith with “Star Route”
address). Tombstone (Jonathan Gordon), Tucson (Theo. Bernard, U. o f Arizona), and
Wilcox (George Witte and Aletta Martin, sister o f Mr. Witte).336

In 1933 the Phoenix Assembly maintained a Post Office Box as a permanent address for
mail “regardless o f any changes which may take place in the personnel o f the Assembly
membership” because “many o f the members live in the metropolitan area outside the city
limits making it difficult to assure satisfactory delivery, without a central and permanent
address.”337 During the early years o f the Phoenix Bahà’i Assembly and Community,
Bahà’is residing outside the city limits o f Phoenix were carried on the membership rolls of
Phoenix. Therefore, when the young man at the prison in Florence was enrolled by the
Phoenix Assembly in December 1933, the Assembly considered him a voting member of
the Phoenix Bahà’i Community.338 The National Assembly advised Phoenix that since
Florence was so distant from Phoenix (“about seventy miles”), it would be beyond the
area of their (Phoenix Assembly’s) jurisdiction and referred to the then current by-laws
which provided that “people living near a Bahà’i community may become voting members
but they must be so situated that they can attend meetings regularly.”339 In February, the
National Assembly wrote Phoenix that Mr. Burrows (in Florence Prison) could “be
regarded from the spiritual point o f view as a true Bahà’i, but with respect to membership
in a local community, since association is impossible, it would be wrong to confer upon
him voting rights under a condition making it impossible for him to fulfill the responsibility
implied by such membership.”340

The National Assembly also called the Phoenix Assembly’s attention to a Bahà’i
administrative principle that “the character o f local Bahà’i community, as the very

contained some names and addresses o f Bahà’is living outside o f Phoenix.344

Paul Schoeny and Mathew White were two o f the nine Bahà’is elected to the Phoenix
> Assembly in April 1934, making Mr. White the first African-American to serve on the
> Phoenix Assembly.345 Mr. Schoeny was elected chairman of the Assembly and Mr. White,

> year and Mr. Schoeny was the first Phoenix delegate to attend and represent Phoenix in
person.347

In June 1934, the Assembly was pursuing information regarding incorporation,348 but it
would be several years before incorporation would be realized.

In November 1934, the Phoenix Assembly showed an interest in having a written record
> o f the history o f the Faith in Phoenix.349 At an Assembly meeting in January 1935 Nina
> Ruppers Seibert presented an historical record compiled by her mother, Amanda Ruppers,
> beginning with Orcella Rexford’s meeting in Phoenix in 1929.350 (In July 1937, Assembly
> records note that the Assembly’s secretary, Amy Dwelly, had completed editing the
> history notes o f early Bahà’i work done in Arizona— notes written by Nina Seibert based
on information from her mother, Amanda Ruppers, and other pioneer Bahà’is beginning in
1900 through April 1930.)351

At the Nineteen Day Feast in November 1934, it was decided by unanimous vote to
> temporarily close the rented Bahà’i Center because o f the need for funds to continue
> construction o f the Bahà’i House o f Worship in Wilmette. The Phoenix Bahà’is decided
their meetings would be held in the homes o f Bahà’is until another public hall or Center
became necessary.352 The strain o f the effects o f the Great Depression continued to impact
economic conditions throughout North America.

Regular meetings and Feasts continued to be held, but there were no special activities
until January 1935 when Orcella Rexford, accompanied by her husband Dr. Gayne
Gregory, again visited Phoenix.353 Reminiscent o f her eventful, productive visit in 1929,
Miss Rexford presented another series o f paid lectures (“nutrition, color psychology and
numerology”)354 followed by a                                   free lecture about the Bahà’i Faith. Several hundr
were expected to attend the free lecture. A group o f individuals responded and formed a
Bahà’i study class which began in March and continued for several months, first taught by
Mamie Seto o f San Francisco, then by Edwinna Nicholson (formerly Edwinna Powell);355
both women previously had taught similar classes in Phoenix. The Assembly also utilized
the services o f both women for public meetings with the usual newspaper publicity.356

Current (year 2004) Phoenix Bahà’i John Eichenauer III recalled that as a lad in Phoenix
in 1935, he accompanied his father and attended Orcella’s five-day paid lecture series

followed by a free Saturday lecture that Orcella had been characterizing as a “wonderful
> event that will change your lives.” John found the free lecture very appealing— it
> introduced him to the Bahà’i Faith. He started going to Bahà’i meetings, including the
> follow-up classes by Mamie Seto and Edwinna Nicholson, and he considered himself a
Bahà’i from then on.357

Miss Rexford’s visit and its outcome must have been particularly welcomed by the
> Phoenix Bahà’is because records from 1935 note that a great many Bahà’is had moved
> away, some had been withdrawn from membership, some were transferred to an “isolated”
> membership list358 and some had died, leaving a total o f twenty-eight as members o f the
Phoenix Bahà’i Community.359 Among those listed as withdrawn were six who had been

dropped from the Phoenix list o f voting members for not attending meetings.360 A letter
from the National Assembly soon explained why this action was not authorized, namely,
that local Assemblies have the responsibility o f “arousing the interest o f those who can but

> do not attend Nineteen Day Feasts and other meetings” and that such action “should be
> decided only where a Bahà’i has moved to another city,” or “has specifically given up faith
in the Cause o f Bahà’u ’ilàh.”361 Restoration of the six to voting membership brought the
total number o f adult Bahà’is to thirty-four.

At the Annual Election Meeting in April 1935, just prior to the election o f the Phoenix
Assembly, various reports presented included committee reports— one o f which was the
“Glendale Activities (Study Group)” prepared by Emma Jones.362 (More about the
Glendale activities will be forthcoming.)

In October 1935, Shoghi Effendi sent the National Assembly a cablegram of
congratulations to be conveyed to the Bahà’is assembled in Wilmette to celebrate the
completion o f the dome unit o f the House o f Worship. He informed them that “The new
hour has struck... calling for nation-wide, systematic, sustained efforts in teaching
field. . . .”363 “Ten weeks later he is even more categoric, and indeed prophetic, for one
seems to feel the first cold shadow o f the coming war: ‘This new stage in the gradual
unfoldment o f the Formative Period o f our Faith into which we have just entered— the
phase of concentrated teaching activity— synchronizes with a period o f deepening gloom,
o f universal impotence, o f ever-increasing destitution and wide-spread disillusionment in
the fortunes o f a declining age.’”364 In 1936, as will be seen, the Phoenix Assembly and
individual Arizona Bahà’is arose and responded to Shoghi Effendi’s appeal for
concentrated teaching activity.

Around 1936 Arizona became home, briefly, to Arna True Perron, daughter o f Corinne
True. After Am a’s son Larry recovered from a bout o f pneumonia while they were living
in the Chicago area, his doctor indicated that the damp, cold winters there were dangerous
for his weakened lungs. This prompted Arna and her three children to settle for about two
years on a ranch in Wilcox where the dry climate, pure air, and plenty o f sunshine
contributed to an improvement in her son’s health.365 Corinne True, no stranger to
Arizona, visited her grandchildren in Wilcox where “the boys enjoyed showing off their
horse-riding skills to her.” The oldest o f Arna’s children, daughter Patty, attended the
University o f Arizona in Tucson.366

In June 1936, B ahà’i                          Newspublished a map o f the United States showing the locatio
Bahà’i Assemblies and groups. Arizona was designated as having one Assembly—
Phoenix— and Bahà’i groups were identified in Payson, Buckeye, Kelvin, Florence,

Wilcox and Tombstone.367 In addition, the town o f Jerome was opened to the Faith when
Nancy Phillips with her husband. Dr. Robert T. Phillips (not a Baha’i), relocated there in

1936 from the Chicago area. Dr. Phillips worked for the United Verde (Copper Company)
Hospital and was also County Health Officer and School Physician.368

Mrs. Phillips presented a series of talks on the Faith broadcast by the Jerome radio
> station369 KCRJ. In 1997, Mrs. Phillips’ son Robert recalled that one o f his mother’s
> services to the Faith while living in Jerome was to slow down his birth so she could finish
pre-recording one o f these programs. She then hurried on to the hospital, up twenty-five

stair steps, to give birth to him. Apparently the hospital personnel were quite startled to
hear the voice of their patient being broadcast over the radio.370 In 1943 Dr. and Mrs.
Phillips with their two children moved to Phoenix.371 Nancy was promptly elected to the
Phoenix Assembly and served on it for many years and many o f those years as its
secretary.372

During the fall o f 1936, Miriam Bugbee was elected as the delegate from Phoenix to the
National Convention.373 Also in the latter part of 1936, the Phoenix Assembly began a
concerted effort to open nearby towns to the Faith374 and the city o f Glendale was selected
as a goal for a second Bahà’i Assembly in Arizona.375 Bahà’i teaching efforts had been
underway there since at least June o f 1933 when Walter Jones reported having interested
“two new inquirers in or near Glendale” and Emma Jones reported that the (Bahà’i) books
in the Glendale library showed use and she suggested planning for some meetings in
Glendale.376 In June 1935, Walter Jones had reported at the Nineteen Day Feast in Phoenix
that a woman from Glendale wished to join the Phoenix group as a Bahá’í,377 and in July
1935, Bertha Braden o f Glendale was enrolled by the Phoenix Assembly.378

The National Teaching Committee reported in February 1937 that “the Glendale,
Arizona members o f the Phoenix Bahà’i Community have been working diligently toward
the goal o f a local Spiritual Assembly in their city....The friends are cooperating with a
local peace group so that it now uses Bahà’i literature for reference purposes, and has
used the ‘Prayer for All Nations’ at some o f its meetings.”379

It appears that the peace group was initiated by Bahà’is and was called the Camelback
Women’s Peace Group. Their first meeting, “in the Camelback district near Glendale,”
was held on September 30, 1936, at the home of (Bahà’i) Emma Jones, on Camelback
Road. The initial group consisted o f seven women— four were listed from Glendale and
three from Phoenix— and they decided to meet every second Wednesday.380 The Bahà’is
present were Zahrah Schoeny and Letitia Main from Phoenix and the hostess, Emma
Jones. Mrs. Jones, whose address was given as Glendale, was International Corresponding
Secretary for the Phoenix Assembly,381 having been appointed in April 1934 to assist the
Assembly’s corresponding secretary,382 a position she held until at least November 1936;383
she also kept minutes o f the Peace Group’s meetings.384

From the beginning, at their meetings members o f the Women’s Peace Group read
passages from Bahà’i publications—                  igs,Bahá ’u 'lláh and the New
lean

G                             , The Bahá 7

Peace Program and World Order magazine385— in addition to using occasional Bahà’i
prayers. While their meetings centered around peace, topics were directly or indirectly
related to Baha’i themes such as “Necessity for Unity and Oneness,” “The Divine Plan”
and “Spiritual Education o f Youth and Adults.”386

On December 16 (1936) only three individuals attended the Peace Group’s meeting
either because o f illness or disagreeable weather. “Due to unavoidable circumstances” the
group’s meetings lapsed and Emma Jones’ secretarial records indicate “as soon as we can
we hope to resume our study and efforts for Universal Peace.”387 It appears December
16th was the last meeting.

Early in 1937, Elizabeth Greenleaf from Eliot, Maine, made a return visit to the Phoenix
area. On February 29, she spoke at a public meeting at the Glendale Woman’s Club with
ten non-Bahá’ís present388 and at a public meeting on March 3 at the Schoeny home in
Phoenix.389 A number o f the Phoenix area Baha’is surely recalled her presence in 1929
when she spent five months in Phoenix instructing the group attracted to the Faith through
Orcella’s Rexford’s first Phoenix lecture series.

The Phoenix Assembly received a report (by Emma Jones) regarding a Glendale study
class that the Phoenix Assembly shared with the Bahà’i National Teaching Committee. As
a result, the National Teaching Committee wrote on April 19, 1937, that they anticipated
Glendale should have a Local Spiritual Assembly by the end o f the next Bahà’i year.390

ARIZONA’S ACTIVITY DURING THE FIRST SEVEN YEAR PLAN

1937-1944

> The foreboding o f war is on the horizon. World War II (1939-1945) breaks
> out and is fought in Europe, Asia and the South Pacific.

> “In 1936 the Guardian judged that the administrative structure o f the Cause was
> sufficiently broad and consolidated in North America that he could begin the first stage of
> the implementation of the Divine Plan itself... .Calling o n .. the believers in North America,
> the Guardian laid out a Seven Year Plan, scheduled to run from 1937 to 1944. Its
> objectives were to establish at least one Local Spiritual Assembly in every state o f the
> United States and every province o f Canada, and to open to the Cause fourteen republics
> in Latin America. To these objectives was added the task, immensely demanding o f a
> community with still very limited numbers and severely straitened financial resources, of
> completing the exterior ornamentation o f the ‘Mother Temple of the W est’ [Bahà’i House
o f Worship in Wilmette] .”391

In slightly more than two years after launching the First Seven Year Plan in May 193 7,392

war broke out (1939) in Europe and two years later, in 1941, the United States was
plunged into World War II. It was during this period, one o f the darkest hours facing the
United States and indeed the planet, that activity o f the Seven Year Plan took place.
During this period, the Phoenix area Bahà’is continued their activities as directed;
meetings and publicity often revolved around the subjects o f “Peace” and the “Bahà’i
House o f Worship.”

In April 1937, the Glendale News and Glendale Herald each had published a lengthy
article about a public meeting at the Phoenix YWCA to commemorate the twenty-fifth
anniversary o f ‘Abdu’l-Bahà’s 1912 visit to America. One o f the articles had a photograph
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahà,393 while the other had a photograph of the Bahà’i House o f Worship in
Wilmette.394 References were made to ‘Abdu’l-Bahà’s prediction o f an imminent outbreak
o f war (WW I) and that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had “called upon the American people in 1912 to
assume the leadership in the promulgation o f universal peace.” The Glendale News article
referred to one o f the speakers, Edward Ruppers o f Phoenix, and noted he had seen
‘Abdu’l-Bahà during His 1912 visit to Chicago. The article also mentioned that Mr.
Ruppers was elected a delegate395 to the Bahà’i National Convention and he was expected
to leave that very week for Chicago to attend it.396 A brief article in the Arizona Republic
also referred to Mr. Ruppers as a delegate.397

The editors o f the Glendale newspapers were receptive to printing Bahà’i articles and
the Glendale                  erald, in particular, never hesitated to print what the Bahà’is submitted.398

H
Between April 21, 1936 and April 21, 1937, two Phoenix residents were welcomed as
Bahà’is399 and all the regular Nineteen Day Feasts were observed by the Phoenix BaháM
Community with “good average attendance.” The children participated by reciting from

memory some quotations from Bahà’u ’Uàh’s Hidden Words learned in conjunction with
> children’s classes taught by Nina Ruppers Seibert and then Amy Dwelly.400 The Phoenix
> Teaching Committee arranged programs for forty-seven regular meetings throughout the
> Bahà’i year.401 On January 5, 1937, there were thirty-eight voting members (twenty-one
> years of age and over) in the Phoenix Bahà’i Community, although one person’s address
> was given as San Francisco. During that period, Mrs. Schoeny requested that her given
> name be recorded as “Zahrah” instead o f Pearl,402 and the Phoenix Assembly’s committees
> included a Glendale Committee and a Phoenix Archives Committee.403 By August, the
> Phoenix Teaching Committee was going to work with the Glendale Committee to
organize Glendale activities throughout the winter.404

In April 1937, “America and the Most Great Peace” was the topic o f the second in a
> series of youth symposiums by the Phoenix Bahà’i youth. An article in the Phoenix
> Gazette announced that the symposium was open to the young people o f the city. It noted
> that speakers would identify some problems that young people working for international
> peace could expect to encounter, as well as solutions for them that could be found in the
Bahà’i teachings.405

In May 1937, the Phoenix Assembly reported that new believers were asked to enroll in
> special study classes for one year covering spiritual teachings and then a six-week study
> class on Baha’i administration before becoming voting members o f the Phoenix Bahà’i
Community.406

The commemoration o f the Declaration o f the Báb on May 23 was held at the Ruppers
> home with fifty-two individuals present.407 That same month, the Phoenix Bahà’i youth
> held a meeting at the Schoeny home where the topic of “Science and Religion” was
> presented by John Eichenauer, Lois Humphrey, Clarence Iverson and Lloyd Schoeny.408

Also in May the Phoenix Assembly sponsored a public symposium on world peace, held at
the Glendale Legion Home. Bahà’i speakers were represented by Walter and Emma Jones
whose topic was “The Bahà’i Peace Plan” and an open discussion welcomed questions

and answers. An article in the Phoenix Gazette had publicized the event and invited the
public to attend.409

The Bahà’is began utilizing the Glendale newspapers with increased frequency for
articles regarding Baha’i news and activities, although many o f the activities took place in
Phoenix. In May, a special article was published in the Glendale News— an announcement
by the Bahà’i National Assembly that it had been informed by cablegram from Haifa,
Palestine, o f the marriage o f Shoghi Effendi and Mary Maxwell.410 (It was on the occasion
o f their marriage that Shoghi Effendi gave Mary Maxwell the name Rúhíyyih Khánum.)411

Both the Glendale News and the Glendale Herald published an article about the July 9th
commemoration o f the Martyrdom o f the Báb. The H eralds extensive article contained an
abbreviated account o f the Bâb’s martyrdom in 1850 as told by Nabil in The Dawn-
Breakers and the article noted a joint commemoration would be observed by the Bahà’is
o f Phoenix and Glendale.412

In September, regular weekly Monday evening Bahà’i meetings were resumed at the
Ruppers home in Phoenix on East Fairmont Avenue, apparently after a summer break, and
the usual invitation was extended to the public.413 It was fairly common for various
businesses and activities to be suspended during the hottest summer months in Phoenix
during this time. Although rather crude commercially produced evaporative coolers were

first introduced in 1930, it was not until after World War II that improved evaporative
coolers became an established product and made Phoenix summers more tolerable.414
(Evaporative coolers started giving way to refrigeration units in the 1950s.)415

On November 1, 1937, the Phoenix Assembly notified the National Spiritual Assembly
that Amanda Ruppers had died on October 14 in Los Angeles after a brief stay in the

hospital there.416 The Ruppers family, mother, father and children, are remembered as the
first permanent Bahà’i residents o f Phoenix, having moved there from Chicago in 1917.

During the fall and winter o f 1937, Phoenix Bahà’is assisted fellow-Bahà’i Laura
Robarts o f Coolidge with arrangements for several public meetings in her hometown. As

> in Phoenix, excellent newspaper publicity was provided that helped to stimulate interest in
a study class.417

In October 1937 Dorothy Baker,418 member o f the National Assembly, was the guest
speaker at an afternoon Feast o f Attraction held in the Phoenix home o f Mr. and Mrs.

Bugbee.419 A newspaper article invited the public and noted that Mrs. Baker’s topic would
be “Cycles of Civilization” and would include an explanation o f the Bahà’i principles as a
basis on which people o f all religions, races and classes can unite.420 During her visit she

> also spoke at a buffet dinner for Bahà’is that was held at the Schoeny home and the
occasion attracted Bahà’is Nancy Phillips from Jerome and Amy Dwelly from Prescott.421

Another member o f the National Assembly, Leroy Ioas, paid a return visit to Phoenix
> and at the Nineteen Day Feast on November 4 he spoke to the Bahà’is about the First
> Seven Year Plan422 that had been launched in May.423 Later in November, the Bahà’is of
Phoenix and the surrounding areas came together to commemorate the Birth of
Bahà’u ’ilàh held at the Schoeny home.424

Clarence Iverson informed the Phoenix Assembly that he was invited to visit with Mr.
Baker (no relation to Dorothy Baker) and his group o f students at the Cave Creek High

School in January 1938, and the Assembly approved his plans for a short talk and songs
and music.425 Also in January the Regional Teaching Committee sponsored a Sunday
afternoon public meeting at the Coolidge Woman’s Club with speakers from Phoenix.
John Eichenauer, a member o f the Phoenix Bahà’i youth group, spoke on the basic
principles o f the Faith and Zahrah Schoeny spoke on the “Gathering o f the Peoples and
Nations.”426 The Committee sponsored a second public meeting in Coolidge in February,
the Bahà’i topics being related to world unity427 and a third meeting in March featured the
topics o f “The Golden Age o f the Human Race” and “God and His Creations.”428 All three
programs incorporated musical presentations by Phoenix Bahà’is.

Simultaneous with activities extended to Glendale and Coolidge in 1937, the Phoenix
Baha’is continued their activities o f expansion and consolidation on the homefront.
Monthly Feasts o f Attraction were held featuring out o f town guest speakers429 who were
also welcomed at Nineteen Day Feasts and whose services were further utilized for public
meetings with newspaper notices and articles that invited the public to attend. In addition,
special meetings with the Bahà’i guest speakers were sometimes held only for the Bahà’is.

In February 1938, Sylvia Matteson, a Bahà’i from Pasadena, was a guest o f the Bugbees
at their West Van Buren Street home. While in Phoenix, Miss Matteson gave a series of
talks on the Faith and spoke to the students at the Junior College. A newspaper article
about her and her visit featured her photograph and invited the public to attend her final
talk at the Schoeny home.430 During her stay. Miss Matteson also attended one o f the

weekly meetings of the Glendale Bahà’i study class where she spoke on the topic, “This
> World Has a Guardian,” and she also presented a brief history o f the Faith and its
principles for the benefit o f two new guests.431

The National Youth Committee had issued a call in December 1937 to all Bahà’i youth
> to unanimously arise as an international body to promote the Third Annual International
> Bahà’i Youth Symposium on Sunday, February 27, 1938, and to begin making plans
> immediately. The Committee had urged that every possible means be used to publicize the
> event.432 The Phoenix youth responded enthusiastically with a public meeting the afternoon
> of February 27 at the Phoenix YWCA. They followed the suggested general theme,
> “Humanity’s Coming o f Age,” with youth speaking on topics recommended by the
> National Youth Committee: “The Dawnbreakers,” “Why Religion?” and “World Order—
> Not Utopia.” Publicity included a comprehensive nineteen column-inch article, in Spanish,
published in El Impartial, a Spanish-language newspaper.433

At Bahà’i events, the musical talents o f various Phoenix Bahà’is were increasingly used,
> particularly those o f Paul Schoeny, a professional singer,434 and John Eichenauer and
> Clarence Iverson, pianists (Clarence occasionally also played the accordion). Their talents
> were utilized when fifty-nine Phoenix and Glendale Bahà’is and guests celebrated Naw
> Rúz (Bahà’i New Year) in March at the Schoeny home. The evening event included talks
> by various Bahà’is interspersed with music that included Paul Schoeny and Gertrude
> Cottrell singing a duet accompanied by pianist Clarence Iverson, a duet sung by Mathew
and Noble White, and a piano duet by John Eichenauer and Clarence Iverson.435

Throughout the years, the Phoenix Bahà’i Assembly and Community, well-grounded
beginning in 1930, attracted the attention o f the National Bahà’i administration. In 1938,
Maurice Besley, a Bahà’i in Tucson, attended occasional events in Phoenix. A matter

regarding him prompted a letter to the Phoenix Assembly from Leroy Ioas as chairman of
the National Teaching Committee (he was also a member o f the National Assembly). In
the letter, Mr. Ioas stated, “The Phoenix Assembly is well-known throughout the country
for its high degree o f unity, and the efficiency of its spiritual services.”436 Such recognized
characteristics contributed considerably to the significant role history bestows upon the
early Phoenix Bahà’i Assemblies and their community members.

In March 1938, another public meeting in conjunction with the Regional Teaching
Committee (RTC) was held at the Coolidge Woman’s Club. Miriam Bugbee, Bahà’i from
Phoenix and member o f the RTC, chaired the meeting. Speakers included Mrs. (Oni) G.C.
Finks, secretary o f the RTC, whose topic was “The Golden Age o f the Human Race.”
Music was provided by Phoenix Bahà’is Gertrude Cottrell, Paul Schoeny, Clarence
Iverson and John Eichenauer.437

Members o f the Glendale study class had written a letter to the Bahà’i National
Assembly in January 1938 expressing a desire to form a Local Spiritual Assembly on April
21 and requested instructions regarding the proper procedure and that they would
appreciate having a teacher.438 The letter was signed by nine individuals, three o f whom
indicated they were preparing for Bahà’i membership— one was Mr. T. E. Dillon,439 an
editor of the Glendale Herald (his office was used for a number o f the study group’s
weekly meetings).440 Each o f the remaining Bahà’is signed as “member o f Phoenix
Community.”441 The minutes o f the January meeting noted the comment made by each
signatory.

A letter dated February 4, 1938, to the Phoenix Assembly stated that the National
Assembly had received a letter signed by nine Bahà’is residing in Glendale who desired to
form a Glendale Assembly on April 21. The National Assembly acknowledged that five of
the nine Glendale Bahà’is were presently “enrolled as members o f the Phoenix Assembly

[community]” (by February 15 the number was noted as seven) and that the Guardian
“always wants an Assembly formed when there are nine or more believers in the same civil
community.” The secretary o f the National Assembly wrote that as far as he could see,
“the National Assembly will sanction the formation of a Glendale Assembly.”442 This letter
appears to have been read at the Phoenix Assembly’s meeting on February 14 and the
Local Assembly, therefore, also sanctioned the formation o f the Glendale Assembly and
the transfer from the Phoenix Bahà’i membership list o f the seven residents o f Glendale
who were registered as members o f the Phoenix community. The Phoenix Assembly had
mixed feelings about the matter—joy at the expansion o f the Faith producing a sister
Assembly in Glendale, but regret at losing a number of Phoenix Bahà’is to Glendale.443

The members o f the Glendale study class began studying a series o f thirty-six lessons,444

and a special meeting o f the Glendale Bahà’i group was held on March 28 to meet with
Mrs. Oni Finks, member o f the Regional Teaching Committee, who was authorized to
ascertain if the group was sufficiently prepared to carry out the contemplated organization
of the Glendale Spiritual Assembly.445

The concentrated efforts o f individual Baha’is identified as residents o f Glendale, the
cooperation of the nearby Phoenix Bahà’i Assembly and its Community, and members of
the Regional Teaching Committee, were credited with making possible the formation of
the second Local Spiritual Assembly in Arizona—that o f Glendale.446 It was formed by
joint declaration447 on April 21, 1938, at the home o f Walter and Emma Jones and was one
o f seven new local Spiritual Assemblies authorized by the National Assembly to be formed
that year.448

Miriam Bugbee, a member o f both the Phoenix Bahà’i Community and the Regional
Teaching Committee, represented the Committee and assisted at the meeting scheduled for
the formation o f the Glendale Assembly. A message was read from Amelia Collins who
sent gifts o f a new edition o f Prayers and Meditations by Bahá ’u ’lláh, and “flower petals
from the Holy Shrines” in small individual cellophane envelopes for each o f the nine
members plus an extra one for the Assembly’s archives.449

A group photograph o f the members o f the Assembly was published in the July 1938

issue o f Bahá 7 News™ The nine Glendale Assembly members were: Sylvanus French,
Helen Burnett, Alice Bennett, Bertha Braden, Donna Braden (enrolled as a Bahà’i in
February), Albert Smith, Patricia Smith, Emma Jones and Walter Jones. Patricia Smith
was elected chairman; Walter Jones, vice-chairman; Alice Bennett, treasurer; Emma Jones,
secretary; Donna Braden, librarian.451 Mr. T. E. Dillon, who had been studying with the
group for Bahà’i membership, previously had moved to Van Nuys, California.452

Between April 21, 1937 and April 21, 1938, the Phoenix Assembly reported that a total
o f 97 Bahà’i meetings were held with a grand total o f 1,250 persons in attendance
including children and adults. In addition, there were twenty-five meetings o f the Local
Assembly. Seventy-one “seekers” met with the Phoenix Bahà’is at various meetings. Also
during the year, Phoenix welcomed twenty-four visiting Bahà’is and welcomed two
women to Bahà’i membership.453

Phoenix delegates Clarence Iverson and Paul Schoeny attended the Thirtieth Annual
> Bahà’i National Convention in April, 1938,454 held in Foundation Hall o f the BaháM House
> of Worship455 that was still under construction in Wilmette. They presented reports of the

> garden o f the Bugbees’ Phoenix home, to commemorate the Declaration of the Báb; the
festivities included a potluck dinner.457

A special BaháM visitor welcomed in June was Agnes Alexander458 whose home was in
> Hawaii. On June 11, 1938, the Bugbees hosted a potluck dinner, again in the garden of
> their home, for the Phoenix and Glendale BaháMs with Miss Alexander who shared her
> recent notes from Haifa459— notes she had taken of Shoghi Effendi’s talks at the dinner

> met Shoghi Effendi and visited Bahà’i Holy Places.)461 While in the Phoenix area, she also
> spoke to a group o f twenty-two Bahà’is and their friends at a Glendale-sponsored meeting
> at the home o f Walter and Emma Jones.462 Miss Alexander and Emma Jones no doubt
> enjoyed their reunion, having known each other in Honolulu where Emma (as Emma
Maxwell Almonte) enrolled as a BaháM in 1927.463 Miss Alexander spoke at another

> meeting in a private home in Glendale where she told the seventeen people present about
> her fourteen years o f BaháM service in Japan.464 She was also the guest speaker at a public
> meeting at the YWCA hall in Phoenix (twenty-five people were present, eight o f whom
were friends o f BaháMs)465 and she presented a fifteen-minute talk on the Faith broadcast
on a Saturday morning over Phoenix radio station KOY.466

During the summer of 1938, Clinton Bugbee o f Phoenix attended the Eleventh Annual
BaháM Summer School at Geyserville, California, where he presented the subject o f a
manuscript he wrote titled, “Religion As a Basis o f World Order.” It dealt with the effect
o f religion upon civilization and the renewal o f basic spiritual principles.467 His manuscript
was published in the January 1939 issue o f the BaháM magazine. World Order.

That fall, in slightly over five months after its formation, the Glendale Assembly decided
in September to concentrate extension teaching efforts in Mesa,468 a community with a
predominately Mormon population where completion of the construction o f a Mormon
Temple had been celebrated in 1928.469 Referred to as “the Mormon Capital o f Arizona,”470
Mesa was located about twenty miles east o f Glendale.

Glendale’s extension teaching decision might have been in response to an appeal because
the Phoenix Assembly reported that following receipt o f a letter from the National
Teaching Committee in August, they also voted to officially sponsor extension teaching (in
Coolidge where organized BaháM activity was inaugurated by the Regional Committee the
previous year.)471

On the afternoon o f Sunday, November 6, 1938, the Phoenix Assembly held the first in a
new series o f public meetings at the Coolidge Woman’s Club building.472 Singer Paul
Schoeny accompanied by pianist Clarence Iverson, contributed their musical talents to a
program that included Phoenix BaháMs who spoke on “The History and Principles o f the
BaháM Faith,” “The Creative Word o f God,” and “The Goal o f a New World Order.”473
The meeting was closed with Paul Schoeny’s a cappella singing o f “Benediction,” written
by Shahnaz Waite.474 Mr. Schoeny often sang the hymn at Nineteen Day Feasts in
Phoenix.475 ‘AbduM-Bahá had advised, “Sing this melody in all gatherings o f Love and

Harmony of the beloved o f God.”476 Another meeting at the same Coolidge location was
> held in December.477 (Around March 1940, Mrs. Robarts, a Bahà’i-pioneer resident of
> Coolidge, moved to Phoenix”478 and Phoenix’s extension teaching in Coolidge apparently
ceased.)

With the threat of a world war drawing ever closer, in January 1939 about eight months
> before World War II broke out, the Glendale Herald published a ten column-inch article
> under the heading, “ ‘Oneness o f Mankind’ Baha'i Plan to Insure World Peace on Earth.”
> It included a quotation from B aháV lláh that comprises almost one and one-half pages in
> Gleanings from the Writings o f                                        B ahd’u ’lldh,and it credited both the
> quotation and the book. In introductory remarks, the article in the Herald referred to “the
> one hope” for world peace, “the greatest need for today,” as being the oneness o f
mankind, and “not conflict and disunion” facing the world.479

Encouragement continued to be provided by visiting Bahà’is who, especially since 1930,
> frequently stopped over in the Phoenix area on their way to and from the West Coast.
> Toward the end o f January 1939, Seigfried Schopflocher o f Montreal, Canada, again
> stopped in Phoenix for two days. He was en route to Los Angeles to attend a meeting of
> the National Assembly o f the U.S. and Canada.480 On a Saturday afternoon he met with the
> Phoenix and Glendale Bahà’is at the Bugbee home, was guest speaker at a 6 P .M . supper­
> meeting with the Bahà’is and their friends at the Schoeny home, followed by an 8 o ’clock
> meeting open to the public with about forty-six persons in attendance.481 On Sunday
> morning, he was a guest at a picnic breakfast at Papago Park hosted by the Bahà’is482—
before continuing on to Los Angeles.

As in the past two years, the Phoenix Bahà’i youth group’s 1939 activities included a
symposium open to the public; this one centered around the theme “Unfoldment o f World
Civilization.” It was held February 26th at the Phoenix YMCA, was attended by thirty-
two people and was scheduled as part o f the worldwide observance o f the Fourth Annual
International Bahà’i Youth Day. The program included talks by John Eichenauer and other
Bahà’i youth.483 The Baha’is secured fifteen-minutes for the subject o f “One Common
Faith” broadcast that evening on radio station KOY.484

In addition to Bahà’i publicity in Phoenix and Glendale newspapers that year, the
Phoenix Assembly’s Publicity Committee reported that one item appeared in the Tucson
Daily Citizen.™ (Back on April 21, 1938, Phoenix also had reported that “during the past
Bahà’i year,” a Bahà’i item had been published in the Tucson Daily          .j486

The Bahà’i communities o f Phoenix and Glendale continued their mutually supportive
activities in 1939 and in March they again celebrated Naw Rúz together with a buffet
dinner. Fifty-one individuals were present including sixteen non-Bahá’í guests from
Phoenix and one from Glendale.487

The Phoenix Assembly incorporated in 1939 with the filing of Articles o f Incorporation
on April 6,488 qualifying it for another “first” in Arizona Bahà’i history. (Seven of the
incorporators were among the group o f Bahà’is that elected the first Phoenix Assembly in
1930\.)489 The incorporation was given additional historic significance when Shoghi Effendi
included Phoenix in a list o f worldwide incorporated local Assemblies in his 1944
publication, G od Passes By, a history o f the Bahà’i Faith from 1844 to 1944.490

Phoenix teaching efforts continued to bear sporadic fruit in their own community. Two
Phoenix residents were welcomed as Baha’is during the 1938-1939 Bahà’i year: Ann

> Williamson and Helen Shearer.491 Mrs. Shearer hosted the Nineteen Day Feast on April 9th
> at her South Central Avenue home two months after her Bahà’i enrollment.492 During that
Bahà’i year, Mathew White, first African-American elected to the Phoenix Assembly
(1934), died.493

During this period, the Phoenix Assembly had a procedure in effect (later simplified) that
complied with suggestions made by the National Assembly for enrolling individuals as
Bahà’is. The person first applied to the local Assembly for membership after having

> attended Bahà’i meetings, usually a series o f study classes and the completion o f a study
> of Bahà’i administration. The Assembly then arranged to meet with the individual and at
> this meeting read to the applicant relevant excerpts from B aha’i Administration,
qualifications o f voting membership in a Bahà’i community, excerpts from the writings of

‘Abdu’l-Bahá and an explanation o f Bahà’i organization. Following acknowledgement
> from the applicant that he/she understood and accepted the tenets o f the Faith and had
> carefully studied Bahá                           'iAdministration and the Will and Testament o f ‘A bdu ’l-Bahá (a
> usually other Bahà’i literature), the applicant retired to another area while the Assembly
> consulted. The applicant was then recalled to hear the Assembly’s decision which in most
> cases, if not all, was to lovingly welcome them as a Bahà’i and as a member o f the Phoenix
> Bahà’i Community. The Assembly then wrote a letter to the National Assembly with the
> name and address o f the individual, the date admitted to voting membership, and any other
> pertinent information such as “brought into the Bahà’i Cause through lectures and
teachings o f... .”494

The Bahà’i Summer School at Geyserville continued to attract Bahà’is from Phoenix
> and attendance at the session in July 1939 was an occasion for publicity in at least three
> issues o f Phoenix newspapers.495 An unusual one in the Sunday edition o f the Arizona
Republic consisted o f a sketch o f a map o f the U S. with cartoon-style drawings of an

> auto, a train engine and a boat, with the heading “By Highway - By Rail - By Boat and
> By Golly.” Various Arizona residents had sent post cards to the newspaper that in turn
> identified the individuals and their travel locations on the map. Included were “John and
Kenneth Eichenauer attending Baha'i Summer School at Geyserville, Calif, with Mr & Mrs

> C. H. Bugbee; Mr & Mrs Schoeny; Genay, Rocella and Zohrl [Zahrl] Schoeny; and
> Adrienne Ellis.”496 The Phoenix Index published an article, about twelve column-inches,
with the heading “America’s Spiritual Mission” in large letters and noting its author, “By
John Eichenauer [Phoenix Bahà’i], Geyserville Baha’i Summer School, July 12, 1939.” It
appears to be the text o f a presentation Mr. Eichenauer made at the Summer School.497

In messages to the Bahá’is o f the U.S. and Canada in 1938 and early 1939, Shoghi
Effendi had referred to the “marked deterioration in world affairs, and the steadily
deepening gloom” enveloping the “Old World” that invested “the Seven Year Plan...with
a significance and urgency that cannot be overestimated.” He also referred to “the
imperative, the spiritual needs of the remaining Republics o f both Central and South
America, for whose entry into the fellowship of Bahà’u ’ilàh the [Seven Year] Plan was
primarily formulated.”498

As the rumblings o f a world war became louder and louder, the Second World War
began when Hitler’s Nazi troops invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. Two days earlier,
in a cablegram dated August 30, 1939, Shoghi Effendi had referred to “Shades o f night
descending on imperilled humanity” that “are inexorably deepening.”499

Shoghi Effendi’s messages to the North American Bahà’is through their National
> Assembly and at National Conventions spurred the Bahà’is on through a continual flow of
> his encouraging words such as, “The privileged community of American believers
> forewarned, undismayed, spiritually equipped”500 and “Victories unsuspected are within
> reach of community. The sooner they are achieved, the sharper the contrast offered with
> distracting miseries afflicting a generation which the Faith alone can and must eventually
> redeem”;501 the American Bahà’is “pursue their God-given task” o f the Seven Year Plan
“with a radiance that no earthly gloom can dim ... .”50J

In September 1939, John Eichenauer at the age o f seventeen, a recent graduate of
> Phoenix High School503 and a member o f the National Bahà’i Youth Committee,504 became
> the (then) youngest Bahà’i foreign pioneer when he left Phoenix for San Salvador, El
> Salvador, in Central America in response to the First Seven Year Plan.505 According to
> Rúhiyyih Khanum, “Shoghi Effendi would mention with pride this young man’s response
> to the need for pioneers.” Initially, John “was advised he was too young and should wait
> until he was older and had finished more o f his studies; Shoghi Effendi cabled the
> American National Assembly to reconsider letting him g o ....”506 Soon John was joined in
> San Salvador by his Bahà’i friend and co-worker from Phoenix, Clarence Iverson.507
> Louise Caswell, a Bahà’i pioneer in Central America, witnessed the results o f the services
> and activities o f the two men in El Salvador and reported they had established the Faith
there on a solid basis.508

In Arizona, Nancy Phillips’ Bahà’i teaching efforts in Jerome continued with radio
broadcasts and in September, the topic was “The Basis o f the Brotherhood o f Mankind.”

That same month, Paul Schoeny o f Phoenix supported her efforts with a presentation on
“Love, the Key to World Unity” broadcast by the Jerome station.509 In Phoenix, a Bahà’i

> study class began in November 1939 at the Bugbee home that was attended by eleven
> individuals (six o f whom were basically hearing about the Faith for the first time) including
one person from Tolleson.510

The previous month, October 1939, the Phoenix Assembly had decided to rent a room
at the YWCA for a period o f six months. Plans included public meetings to be held there
on the first and third Sunday evenings o f each month. The rental charge was $1.50 per
meeting.511 The location was changed when the Schoenys offered two rooms in their
spacious home at 302 West Portland for use as a Bahà’i Center.512 In preparation for this,
some furnishings were loaned and others donated by Bahà’is o f the community;513 even the
children helped by washing the windows and woodwork.514 On November 23, guest
Amelia Collins officially opened the Center with a short prayer service.515 The significance
o f the occasion was apparent by the attendance of members o f the Glendale Assembly and
by former Phoenix Bahà’i residents Frances Howard o f Pasadena, California, Letitia Main
o f Prescott and Nina Ruppers Seibert o f Payson.516 Within the first five months a variety of
activities took place. Weekly Sunday evening Bahà’i meetings were attended by an
average o f nineteen individuals and a (non-Bahá’í) Phoenix Health Study Class held every
other Sunday afternoon during March and April attracted a number o f people who became
“interested in the Bahà’i teachings, many o f them hearing o f the teachings for the first
time.” A Bahà’i Reading Room opened in February (every Tuesday and Thursday from 1
to 4pm ) and on March 21, a tea was held announcing that the Reading Room and the
Bahà’i Center were available to the public. The Reading Room was furnished with fifty-

some books and twenty-seven magazines for use, and Nineteen Day Feasts, Spiritual
> Assembly meetings, Bahà’i child education classes and a number o f Feasts o f Attraction
> were also held at the Center. The Library Room was rented beginning in February,
> generating a “nice” fund for additional furnishings.517 The Center was attributed with
attracting increased interest in the Faith.518

Various other Phoenix activities during the Bahà’i year 1939 to 1940 included the
> donation of Bahà’i books and/or magazine subscriptions to Fort Grant Boys School,
Maricopa County Library, Phoenix Junior College and the Phoenix Public Library.519

In November 1939, a farewell party was held at the Bahà’i Center for Clarence Iverson
> who was leaving to join his friend John Eichenauer in San Salvador.520 A newspaper article
> reported Clarence’s and John’s “purpose is to establish the Baha'i faith in that country
> through helping to spread throughout the Western hemisphere the teachings of
Baha’u ’llah establishing human brotherhood and universal peace.”521

Between April 21, 1939 and April 1940, the brother o f Amelia Collins, Oscar Engelder
> and his wife, and also John and Clarice Eichenauer—who were supportive, including
> financially, o f their son going to pioneer in Central America— were among a number of
> individuals attending Bahà’i meetings to learn more about the Faith.522 Three adults were
> welcomed and enrolled as Bahà’is during the year and three youth declared their intention
> of becoming voting members o f the Bahà’i community when they attained the age of
twenty-one.523

Twenty-two children from Phoenix and Glendale attended Bahà’i children’s classes that
year plus a child from Tempe324 whose mother was accepted as a voting member o f the
Phoenix Bahà’i Community on June 30, 1940.525

In 1940, ten years after the election of the first Assembly o f Phoenix, the Assembly had
ten committees to assist the community’s activities: Publicity and Radio, Teaching,
Nineteen Day Feasts, Archives and History, Youth, Child Education, Auditing, Hospitality
(all members). Contact and Circuit, and a Center Committee.526

The September 1940 issue o f Bcihá 7 News reported a directive from Shoghi Effendi that
stated, “In connection with the formation o f new Assemblies and the maintenance o f their
Assembly status, the Guardian wishes to reaffirm the general principle that only those who
reside within the city limits of any given locality have the right to either vote or be elected
as member o f the Assembly, even though this may involve frequent dissolution of the
Assembly owing to insufficient number o f members.. .This principle should be closely
adhered to, otherwise it will lead to confusion and overlapping.”527 The October 1940 issue
o f Bahá 7 News listed nine local Assemblies that had been dissolved as a result o f the
application o f the Guardian’s instruction concerning the residence o f voting believers; one
o f them was the Assembly o f Glendale, Arizona.528 Glendale was without a Spiritual
Assembly until one was again formed in 1963 by Joint Declaration o f nine Bahà’is.529

One can perhaps identify some of the confusion and overlapping that may have led to
the 1938 formation o f the Glendale Assembly and then its termination two years later. For
example, a report o f the National Teaching Committee early in 1937 referred to “the
Glendale, Arizona members o f the Phoenix Bahà’i Community....”530 Also, the letter from
Glendale dated January 21, 1938, addressed to the National Assembly expressing the
“desire to form a Baha'i Spiritual Assembly in Glendale, Arizona, on April 21, 1938,” as
noted earlier, was signed with the names and addresses of nine individuals, all listing

Glendale addresses. Six listed a Glendale address with a Route and Box number or “P.O.”
> and each o f those six added they were a member o f the Phoenix Bahà’i Community.531 The
> City o f Glendale incorporated in 1910 and some o f the Bahà’is may have assumed their
> Glendale mailing addresses constituted their place o f residence when in reality, they did
not reside within the required “civil limits” (incorporated limits) o f the City of Glendale.

The 1940 announcement o f Shoghi Effendi’s directive that led to the dissolution o f the
> Glendale Assembly also led the Phoenix Assembly to make some adjustments in its
> membership roster, and the Assembly transferred to an “isolated list” a number o f Phoenix
> Bahà’is determined to be living outside the city limits o f Phoenix. This step resulted in the
> need for a by-election to replace two members o f the Assembly.532 The adjustments made
> to its community membership also resulted in a group o f Bahà’is living just outside the
> Phoenix city limits. On January 18, 1941, four o f these Bahà’is decided to form an
> organized group— “the first rural Bahà’i Community in Arizona” and they elected a
> recording secretary.533 The four individuals were Amelia Engelder Collins, her brother
> Oscar Engelder and his wife Louetta (who were now Bahà’is) and Edward Ruppers.

Louetta Engelder was elected secretary. (This account will follow the development o f this
Bahà’i group.)

In March 1941, the National Teaching Committee reported highlights o f a teaching
project in a number o f cities in the southwest that included Phoenix. The services o f a
travel teacher, Beatrice Irwin, and various National Committees were coordinated with the
Bahà’is o f selected cities to obtain wide publicity and personal contacts and to consolidate
with adequate literature, a traveling library and plans for follow-up study. Among the
materials provided in Phoenix were a traveling library for display, radio transcriptions,
“diversified” free literature, books for library placements and sale, and a small model of
the Bahà’i House o f Worship with publicity material about it.534

Miss Irwin spoke at three public meetings in Phoenix that attracted about 150 people—
at the YW CA and at the Adams and Westward Ho Hotels. Another public meeting held
at the Veteran’s Hall in Glendale attracted about forty people. Broadcasts about the Faith
were made on radio stations KTAR and KPHO, a small plaster model o f the Bahà’i House
o f Worship was displayed for a few days at two different Phoenix stores and Bahà’i books
were displayed in a local bookstore. Miss Irwin also addressed about 500 students o f the
Phoenix Junior College in addition to having personal interviews with individuals including
an Episcopalian Dean, a Rabbi, and the Dean of Phoenix Junior College. She also
contacted the managers o f a number o f prominent area hotels— Camelback Inn, Jokake
Inn, San Carlos Hotel, and the Wigwam Hotel at Litchfied—the Tempe College, Dean
Gammage, and the Optimist Club. As a result o f the activities, a Monday evening study
class began for people interested in learning more about the Faith.535

During the 1940-1941 Bahà’i year, the Phoenix Assembly reported it enrolled six
individuals as Bahà’is including the woman who lived in Tempe and one individual who
lived outside the city limits o f Phoenix.536

Miriam Bugbee o f Phoenix was re-appointed as a member o f the 1941-1942 Regional
Teaching Committee that served, among other states, Arizona. She had been a member of
the Committee since its inception in 1936.537 The 1941-1942 RTC also included other
current and former Arizona Bahà’is— Amy Dwelly, Sadie Ellis, Mrs. I. A. (Nellie) Ircadia
and Paul Schoeny.538

Expansion-consolidation activities resulted in the formation o f a new Local Spiritual
Assembly in 1941— the Phoenix East Rural Assembly,535 apparently formerly the “first

rural Bahà’i Community [Group] in Arizona.” There was some question about what name
> to use for the Assembly but Arizona again had two Bahà’i Assemblies. Three organized
> Bahà’i groups were reported that spring—the city o f Glendale and two separate Glendale
Township groups.540

Following the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the United
States entered World War II. The National Assembly published a cablegram dated six days
> later from Shoghi Effendi to be shared with the Spiritual Assemblies, Communities and
> Groups of the Bahà’is o f the United States and Canada.541 It stated, in part, that “the great
> Republic o f the New World, the enviable parent o f System heralding the World Order of
> Bahà’u ’ilàh, must assume through adversity its preponderating share of responsibility to
> lay down, once for all, broad, worldwide, unassailable foundations o f that discredited yet
> immortal System” and he appealed to all the Bahà’is not to relax their teaching efforts or
> “slaken their sacred task o f building the institutions whose progress destiny has
> indissolubly linked with the fortunes of the most disastrous, most challenging, most
> pregnant period o f human history.”542 The onward progress o f the Faith continued
nationally and locally.

After one and one-half years as a Bahà’i pioneer in San Salvador, former Phoenix
> resident John Eichenauer went on to assist the formation o f the first Local Spiritual
> Assembly o f Tegucigalpa, Honduras, in April 1941 and he visited Bahà’is in Nicaragua,
> Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala and Mexico.543 His pioneering was cut short by World
> War II and in October 1942 he was drafted into the U.S. Army. In a letter addressed to
> “Messrs. John and Marshall [John’s brother] Eichenauer” from Haifa written on behalf of
> Shoghi Effendi and dated December 5, 1942, Shoghi Effendi recognized that John was
> “doing such good work in Central America” where his “labours were much needed” and
> regretfully acknowledged it was necessary for him to return to the United States— “since
there seemed no choice in the matter, it cannot be helped.”544 John ended up being

stationed in Germany where he helped reorganize the persecuted German Bahà’i
community after V-E Day (May 8, 1945, Victory in Europe Day—the end o f the World
War II fighting in Europe) and he assisted the communication between Shoghi Effendi at
the Bahà’i World Centre and the Bahà’is in Germany.545 He received the American Bronze
Star and French Croix de Guerre (War Cross) for his military services.546

During this time, construction o f the Bahà’i House o f Worship in Wilmette was
progressing and was becoming an increasingly attractive subject for Bahà’i publicity. In
February 1942, a plaster model of it was displayed with pots o f planted tulips in the
window o f Keen’s Flower Shop in Phoenix for a little over two weeks.547 That same month
Miss Adrienne Ellis, chairman o f the Bahà’i youth group in Phoenix, spoke about the
architecture and significance o f the House o f Worship in a program broadcast by radio
station KPHO. The announcer, who introduced Miss Ellis and her subject, told the
listening audience that the “Bahà’i Temple” was dedicated to the promulgation of
universal religion and universal peace. He also announced details o f plans o f the Phoenix
Bahà’i youth to observe the approaching International Bahà’i Youth Day with a
symposium on February 22 at the Phoenix YWCA and the public was invited to attend.548

A year later Adrienne Ellis was listed on the National Assembly’s Pioneer Roll o f Honor
as a homefront pioneer to Greensboro, North Carolina.549

Four adults had applied to the Phoenix Assembly for membership and were welcomed as
> Bahà’is by the Assembly on February 4, 1943.550 (Another adult whose first introduction to
> the Faith was through lectures given by Madame Orlova in 1933, had been welcomed as a
> new Phoenix Bahà’i in August 1942;551 also, two youth joined the Bahà’i youth group
during the Bahà’i year 1942-1943. )552

In March 1943, Amelia Collins o f the Phoenix East Rural Township community was
> elected delegate to the National Convention.553 Local Assemblies elected in April 1943

included one in Phoenix and one in “Phoenix (East Rural),”554 also referred to as East
> Phoenix, or Phoenix East Rural Township. Also listed for that same year were Bahà’i
> groups in Glendale Rural, Phoenix Rural (West), Poston, and Tucson; cities and postal
> zones having isolated Bahà’is were Buckeye, Coolidge, Douglas, Glendale, Kingman,
Payson, Phoenix, Prescott, Sonoita and Tucson.555

The Schoenys’ Phoenix home at 302 West Portland Street was no longer used as a
> Bahà’i Center by April 1943 because the Assembly decided it (the Assembly) “should have
> complete jurisdiction o f a Bahà’i Center, keys and etc.”556 The Assembly had previously
> expressed concern at one o f their meetings about ways and means o f advancing the BaháM
> Faith in Phoenix and one suggestion was to have a Center in downtown Phoenix.557 In
> May, the Assembly appointed a committee to find a location for a Center and it was
successfully accomplished that summer.558

In August 1943, just prior to a national teaching campaign and in time to accommodate
> related local activities, a Bahà’i Center was opened in downtown Phoenix559— a room in
> the Printery Building at 210 West Adams Street was rented for $35.00 per month.560 The
> address was the same as the very first Phoenix BaháM Center rented briefly beginning in
November 1933; in 1933 the building had been known as the Arizona Fire Building.561

The year 1944 would mark the first year o f the second BaháM Century and in
> anticipation of, and in preparation for, the centenary o f the Faith (1844 to 1944) to be
> celebrated following the final phase o f the Seven Year Plan, the National Assembly called
for a nationwide teaching campaign. The plan called for a series o f public meetings in each

local BaháM community from September 1943 to April 1944, culminating in a centenary
celebration on May 23. Four proposed themes, each within a specific time frame, were
Race Unity, Religious Unity, World Unity, and The Manifestation o f God. A public
meeting was to be keyed to each subject within its time frame along with publicity and
study classes.562

As always, the Phoenix Assembly and the BaháMs, as is evident in their activities, closely
followed directives and appeals from Shoghi Effendi and the National Assembly. On this
occasion, the Phoenix and Phoenix East Rural Assemblies responded with plans for an
ambitious series o f events. Dorothy Baker, member o f the National Assembly and five
national committees including the Race Unity Committee,563 gave a public lecture in the
first o f the series on September 30, 1943, at the Phoenix Woman’s Club on the theme of
Race Unity and followed it up with a ten-minute radio talk the next morning. The event at
the Woman’s Club had been promoted through radio announcements, display ads, items in
the newspapers and the mailing o f a letter with a dignified invitational card to civic clubs
and individuals.564

Bahà’is in front of the Phoenix Printery Building. In 1943 a room was rented for a Bahà’i Center.

In 1943 Dorothy Baker spoke at the first of a series of public meetings during a teaching campaign in Phoenix.

The teaching campaign’s program with the theme of Religious Unity was scheduled for
the end of the 1943 565and had as its high point an evening o f music. It was held at the
Schoeny home and fifty invitations had been sent to friends.566 For January and February

1944, the time frame specified for the theme of World Unity, a series o f public meetings
was held on various related topics on Sunday evenings at the Bahà’i Center where a
library and a reading room were open to the public on Monday, Wednesday and Friday
afternoons. Small folded invitational leaflets featuring a picture o f the Bahà’i House of
Worship in Wilmette on the cover and containing the January-February schedules were
printed and distributed. The leaflet also contained two quotations from Bahà’i writings and
a brief statement o f Bahà’i teachings and principles. A symposium for the public by the
Bahà’i youth concluded this phase of the campaign on February 27.567

Programs and schedules were also printed and distributed for public meetings in March
and April, the final phase o f the campaign that had as its theme The Manifestation of
God.568 The Phoenix and Phoenix East Rural Assemblies entered into a contract in April
with the Arizona Republic and Phoenix Gazette for a weekly insertion, during April and
May, o f a short quotation from the Bahà’i writings.569

Thus, the Bahà’i communities o f Phoenix and Phoenix East Rural joined the National
Assembly (whose actions included a letter and a telegram to the President o f the United
States)570 and Bahà’i communities throughout the world, in ushering in the historic Baha’i
Centenary Celebrations in May 1944.

A TWO-YEAR RESPITE

“The two-year respite... is now ended. ” 571

-Shoohi Efendi, A pril 1946

> Between the end o f the first Seven Year Plan (April 1944)572 and the launching o f the
> Second Seven Year Plan (April 1946) there was what Shoghi Effendi called a “two year
> respite.” Rúhíyyih Khánum wrote, “It is unlikely that the American Community had
> realized their arduous labours between 1944 and 1946. . . had been a ‘respite’ until the
Guardian called it that.”573

In a message dated April 2, 1944, Shoghi Eifendi had referred to the total victory o f the
> first Seven Year Plan: “The brilliant achievements o f the heroic pioneers, the itinerant
> teachers, the indefatigable administrators o f Bahà’i teaching activities whether local,
> regional or national, set the seal of total victory on the Seven Year Plan... ,”574 He stated in
> another message on April 15, again referring to the first Seven Year Plan, “The structural
> basis o f the Administrative Order o f the Faith o f B aháV lláh has, through this superb
victory, and on the very eve o f the world-wide celebrations o f the Centenary o f His Faith,
been firmly laid by the champion-builders o f His World Order in every state o f the Great
Republic of the West and in every Province o f the Dominion o f Canada.”575

Prior to the centenary celebrations, Arizona’s first Bahà’i State Convention was held in
April 1944,576 the first time delegates were selected at state conventions by votes from the
eligible Bahà’is o f each state rather than by communities with Local Spiritual
Assemblies.577 That same month a visit from journalist and world traveler Marzieh Gail
provided another opportunity for the Phoenix Assembly to publicize and promote the
Faith. Mrs. Gail, a Bahà’i from San Francisco, was the daughter of distinguished Bahà’i
parents and she spent many years in Persia (Iran). Articles in the Arizona Republic and
Phoenix Gazette publicized her two public lectures at the Bahà’i Center— a Saturday
evening lecture on “Persia As I Saw It” and the other, Sunday afternoon, on “A New Faith
for a New World.”578 She spoke to seventy-five students o f Sociology and English at the
Phoenix Junior College using “Persia As I Saw It” as a background for a presentation on
the Faith. She also spoke to 150 students and teachers o f Carver High School (African-
American) at a special assembly meeting. In addition to “Persia and the Bahà’i Faith,” she
referred to the tribute that the school’s namesake, George Washington Carver, had made
to the Faith. That same day she also spoke to a combined class o f 7th and 8th graders at
Booker T. Washington School. It was reported that Mrs. Gail brought the Bahà’i message
to a total o f 305 young people through her visits to the three schools.579

On the 22nd o f May 1944, the Arizona Republic carried a sixteen column-inch article
about the Bahà’i Faith and the centenary celebration in the U S. and during the centennial
week, a related broadcast was made on Phoenix radio station KPHO. The Phoenix
community had ordered special radio transcripts offered by the Bahà’i National Radio

Committee.580 A local gathering held to celebrate the centenary included listening to the
KPHO radio program, a transcription o f a talk by Marzieh Gail.581

The Phoenix Assembly wrote the national Bahà’i Contacts Committee in September
1944, regarding Italian and German internment camps, Japanese relocation camps and
> several army bases situated in the Phoenix area and inquired if the Committee had any
> plans or suggestions as to how such camps could be contacted and teaching undertaken.582
> The National Assembly replied that the Bahà’i administrative body that had jurisdiction in
> the area (Local Assembly or Regional Committee) and not individual initiative, had
> authorization for distribution o f all Bahà’i literature to military prisoners through
> established channels recognized by the War Department.583 Available records don’t
> indicate what, if any, action was taken by the Phoenix Assembly. However, the Youth
> Symposium that year utilized the Jubilee Singers from the Luke Air Force Base singing a
group o f spirituals.584

The youth were reported as “quite active” during the year. Their activities included
> Sunday meetings and they conducted several of the community’s regular public meetings
> at the Bahà’i Center; they helped, as needed, with children’s classes on Sunday mornings
> and they planned picnics jointly with the children’s group. Several o f the Bahà’i youth
joined the adults on extended teaching trips and participated in the programs that were
presented.585

Approximately ninety-eight inquirers attended Phoenix Bahà’i meetings throughout the
1944-1945 Bahà’i year; at least one individual in Phoenix embraced the Faith that year.586

In March 1945, the Bahà’is of Phoenix sponsored a series of weekly group study
meetings for the public that were held on Sunday afternoons at the Bahà’i Center in the
Printery Building beginning with a series o f five sessions conducted by Mrs. E. R. (Loulie)
Matthews, chairman o f the International Bahà’i School at Colorado Springs. On March 4

> and 11 the subject was Unity as the Pattern for Future Society, followed by Race Amity
> on March 18, Education for World Peace on March 25 and Prayer and Meditation on
April 8. The meetings were all well publicized in the Arizona Republic, Phoenix Gazette
and the Arizona Sun, a “Negro weekly” that carried many reports o f Phoenix and Tucson
Bahà’i activities.587 Although no large numbers o f inquirers were attracted, the same ones
came again and again.588

On Saturday, March 31, the Phoenix Gazette printed an extensive article listing the
sponsors and locations of Easter Sunday observances. Never one to miss an opportunity
to publicize and promulgate the Faith, near the end o f the article was an announcement
that the Phoenix Bahà’is would conduct an afternoon group study and discussion on
“Resurrection” at their Bahà’i Center on West Adams Street (Printery Building).589

Following the April 1945 election o f Assemblies for the Bahà’i year 1945-1946, Arizona
had two Assemblies— Phoenix, and East Phoenix where two residents590 had been
welcomed as new Bahà’is during the past year. Bahà’i groups were reported in Phoenix
Rural (West) and Poston; cities and postal zones listed with isolated Bahà’is were
Coolidge, Buckeye, Florence, Glendale, Kingman, Payson, Phoenix, Prescott, Tempe and
Tucson.591

In June, the Phoenix Assembly submitted to the Bisbee Daily Review a manuscript
released by the National Baha'i News Service and the Assembly expressed the hope the
newspaper would publish it in an early issue.592

World War II officially ended in September 1945 when Japan signed the terms of
surrender following the atom bombing o f Hiroshima in August. That fall, the Phoenix
Assembly sponsored another series o f public meetings at the Center, this time on the
general theme. Steps Toward World Peace.593 They also planned a separate weekly series
of hour-long study classes for the Bahà’i community beginning with the then recent
publication, God Passes By, the Guardian’s history o f the first Bahà’i century.594

The Assembly was notified by the Printery Building manager in November that the space
rented for the Bahà’i Center was being requisitioned for commercial use, so activities were
carried on without a Center; public meetings took the form o f informal study classes held
in the homes o f the Bahà’is.595

The Second Seven Year Plan
'‘The time is ripe.. .for inauguration of a Second Seven

Year Plan. ”596 -S h o g h i E ffe n d i, A p r il 1946.

> In April o f 1946, a message from the Guardian to the Thirty-Eighth Annual Convention at
> the Bahà’i House o f Worship in Wilmette, announced the inauguration of a second Seven
> Year Plan (1946-1953) for the American Bahà’is. The first o f several goals was the
> consolidation o f victories already won throughout the Americas, involving multiplication
> of Bahà’i centers and bolder proclamation to the masses. The second was completion of
> the interior ornamentation o f the Bahà’i House o f Worship in time for the celebration of
its fiftieth anniversary in 1953.597

A cablegram received from the Guardian on June 13, 1946, included an appeal for the
“number o f Assemblies functioning in North America” to reach 175 before the expiration

o f the second year o f the second stage o f the Divine Plan (April 1948).598 The Phoenix
Assembly responded by sponsoring Tucson as a goal to be raised to Assembly status.599
Between April 1946 and April 1947, Tucson was the main objective o f the Phoenix
Extension Teaching Committee that arranged seven meetings there, some in conjunction
with the Regional Teaching Committee, and the Bahà’is began a series o f radio
programs.000 A number of the meetings were held in the Tucson home of a Bahà’i, Isabelle
Dodge. Twenty-two individuals attended a meeting held in the home of a former Phoenix
Bahà’i, Frances Lewis (formerly Frances Howard), who lived outside o f Tucson. Mrs. Joy
Allen from California was the speaker and she remained in Tucson for one week to do
additional teaching.601

Among the highlights o f activities in 1946, was a Bahà’i exhibit at the Arizona State Fair
in November. The exhibit was sponsored by the Phoenix Assembly with assistance from
the Assembly o f East Phoenix, and it featured a small white plaster model o f the Bahà’i
House o f Worship in Wilmette with a series o f color slides o f the actual edifice that were
automatically projected onto a screen. Two large circular maps o f the world displayed
colored flags designating countries where the Faith was represented and above the maps a
large sign read “The earth is but one country and mankind its citizens - Bahàu’ilàh.” The
Bahà’i exhibit attracted approximately 4,000 people and 2,000 pieces of literature were
handed out. Even State Fair personnel were enthusiastically attracted by the exhibit and
they assured the Bahà’is that space would be available for them at the next year’s Fair.602

Helen Reed Bishop visited Phoenix in January 1947 and spoke to a capacity audience of
180 at the Adams Hotel on “The Meaning of Crisis.” A follow-up meeting the next
evening attracted thirty-five individuals. Mrs. Bishop remained in Phoenix for a week
during which she “did much teaching work” and a study class began for those who were
attracted to the Faith.603

Sometime around June 1947, four Bahà’is including two from the East Phoenix
community visited Safford and Duncan where an evening meeting was attended by

nineteen adults and six children.604 On June 23, the East Phoenix Rural Assembly had
> expressed concern at their meeting that a letter from Amelia Collins “should receive an
answer and a request made fo r... [her] official transfer” to Evanston, Illinois.605

Following communications back and forth between the East Phoenix Rural Assembly
> and the National Assembly and its Regional Teaching Committee, on July 22, 1947, the
> National Assembly wrote that the conditions for electing the East Phoenix Rural Assembly
> on April 21 (1947) did not exist due to an inadequate number o f resident Bahà’is and it
> therefore had reverted to Group status.606 Although the local Bahà’is must have been
> deeply disappointed over the changed status o f their community, they anticipated re­
forming as an Assembly in April 1948.607

In September 1947, the East Phoenix Group contacted Zahrah Schoeny o f Phoenix
> about initiating a series o f meetings with Bahà’is living close to Phoenix and it was
reported that several meetings were being held in Tempe.608

In a cablegram to the National Assembly dated January 10, 1948, Shoghi Effendi made
> an urgent “last minute appeal to every single member o f the community, the champion
> warriors in the army o f Bahà’u ’Uàh” to “fill the gap” regarding attainment o f the goal of
> 175 functioning Assemblies in North America (the United States and Canada) by April 21,
> 1948.609 At the National U S. Bahà’i Convention in 1948, the National Teaching
> Committee was able to report the goal o f 175 actually had been surpassed with a total of
194 functioning Assemblies.610

Contributing to this success was an Arizona Bahà’i Group (most likely East Phoenix
Rural, having reverted from Assembly to Group status) designated as “East Phoenix.”611

The name was soon changed to “North Phoenix”612 and it soon changed from a Bahà’i
Group to a Local Spiritual Assembly. A special meeting with Nancy Phillips (Phoenix
Bahà’i), who was a member o f the Regional Teaching Committee, was held with the
Group in early April to discuss forming a Local Spiritual Assembly on April 21st. Mrs.
Phillips noted that the Group was known both as East Phoenix and North Phoenix and she
offered to try to clarify the matter with the National Assembly.613 The Assembly was to be
designated as “North Phoenix.”

In 1948 two new Bahà’i Assemblies in Arizona were formed in response to Shoghi
Effendi’s emergency appeal—the Assembly o f North Phoenix614 and the Assembly of
Tucson that was assisted by eight Bahà’is relocating there.615 Phoenix Bahà’is were
involved in the formation o f both— Clarence Iverson and Owen Trowbridge relocated to
“North Phoenix” and Paul and Zahrah Schoeny and family relocated to Tucson. The four
adult Phoenix Bahà’is were among 134 who arose to resettle in areas o f the U S. to secure
endangered Assemblies and enable new ones to be formed.616 Clarence Iverson had
returned to Phoenix after serving as a Bahà’i pioneer to El Salvador, Central America,
from 1939 to 1946, initially under the First Seven Year Plan. (He died in 1979— again
serving the Faith as a pioneer, this time to the French island o f Corsica in fulfillment o f one
o f the goals of the Nine Year Plan, 1964-1973.)617

Members o f the first Assembly o f Tucson in 1948 were: Isabelle Dodge, Maida Merriam
from Chicago, Mabel Hoegner from Tucson Township #13, Paul and Zahrah Schoeny
from Phoenix, Kathyrn Frankland from Kentucky, Mary Louise Kelsey from New Jersey,
and Evelyn and Richard Walters from New Mexico.618

Also in 1948, “the oldest National Assembly in the Bahà’i world, that o f the United
> States and Canada,”619 became two separate Assemblies when Shoghi Effendi “launched
> Canada on her own independent administrative destiny” with her own first National
Convention in April.620

Throughout 1948, the Phoenix Bahà’i activities included fairly regular public meetings,
> with notices and articles in newspapers serving the Phoenix area. Local Bahà’is generally
> were utilized as speakers at the public meetings and occasional visiting Baha’i speakers
> included Mamie Seto from San Francisco. She had conducted the Bahà’i study class that
> was formed in Phoenix in 1935 following Orcella Rexford’s series o f lectures, and she was
one o f several speakers at a Phoenix Bahà’i Winter Institute in 1948.621

By the summer o f 1948 the Bugbees, early Phoenix Baha’is, had built an addition onto
> their West Van Buren Street home that accommodated many Bahà’i gatherings. This
> addition had the name “Assembly Hall” printed in large letters over the front doorway. In
> 1989 the building could still be identified, but abandoned and deteriorating in a setting
> quite different from the upper middle class residential neighborhood o f the 1930s and into
> the 1950s. On July 9, 1948, the Bahà’is commemorated the Martyrdom o f the Báb at the
> Assembly Hall site followed by a memorial service for George Latimer622 who had died in
> June.623 He was remembered for his many Bahà’i services including his membership on the
> National Assembly and for his assistance as chairman at the 1930 meeting for the election
> o f the very first Phoenix Assembly.624 In the fall of 1948, the Bugbees offered the use of
Assembly Hall to the Phoenix Bahà’i community for a Bahà’i Center.625

Assembly Hall became the site o f many Bahà’i events including the four-day first annual
> Winter Institute on Bahà’i Education sponsored by the Phoenix Assembly in December
> 1948 with Bahà’i and non-Bahá’í participants and open to the public.626 On the evening o f
the first day’s session a Fellowship (or “Friendship”) Feast was held, attended by

> approximately sixty-three people.627 One o f several Bahà’i speakers was Amelia Engelder
> Collins from Wilmette,628 whose brother Oscar Engelder and his wife were now members
o f the Bahà’i Assembly o f North Phoenix. Filmstrips, movies, music, and dancing filled the
Winter Institute’s evenings.629 The cover o f the program for the Institute had a photo o f
the Bugbee residence with its Assembly Hall addition.630 Advance publicity, mailed
programs, personal invitations and prayers all contributed to the Institute’s success “from
which,” according to the National Teaching Committee, “have come many
confirmations.”631 On Saturday, December 25, the day before the Institute began, Clinton
Bugbee spoke at a public meeting held in Assembly Hall. His topic, appropriate for
Christmas Day, was “The Prince of Peace” (BaháV lláh).632

The Bahà’i State Convention in February 1949, held in Assembly Hall,633 was attended
by twenty-eight eligible Bahà’i voters, plus children, and guests who were Bahà’is. The
total number o f eligible voters in Arizona that February was reported to be seventy.034
Forty-seven ballots were cast that elected John Eichenauer and Paul Schoeny as delegates
to the National Convention.635

In April 1949, following the formation o f local Spiritual Assemblies, Arizona had three
Assemblies— Phoenix, North Phoenix and Tucson; cities and townships having Bahà’i
groups were located in Duncan, Glendale Rural West, Prescott and Tucson Township 14;
localities having isolated Bahà’is were Buckeye, Coolidge, Flagstaff, Florence, Glendale,

Among the goals o f the Second Seven Year Plan, as noted, was the completion o f the
interior ornamentation o f the Bahà’i House of Worship in Wilmette by 1953637 and in July
1949, work began on it.638 Ever mindful of the directives o f Shoghi Effendi and their
current status, the Arizona Bahà’is must have been gratified to see the article published in
the Arizona Sun on July 15, 1949, explaining details of masonry techniques and the work
underway, just four days after the work began on completion o f the interior
ornamentation. The article was accompanied by a four inch by six and one-half inch sketch
of what three of the lace-like sections o f stonework would look like when they were
assembled and in place. It would be several more years before it was completed.

Conclusion

> Looking back over the years 1900 to 1950, one can see the evolving process o f the
> establishment o f the Bahà’i Faith in Arizona during a period that overlapped the ministries
> and guidance o f ‘Abdu’l-Bahà and then Shoghi Effendi. Progress o f the Faith in Arizona
> can also be attributed to close association and cooperation o f the unified Bahà’is with the

In February 1953, the Ten Year Crusade was launched639 and in May o f that same year
the House o f Worship in Wilmette was dedicated in a public ceremony.640

By August 1953 there was a newly formed Arizona Assembly, Tucson Township 14,
> that wanted to adopt Clifton, Arizona, as their Extension Teaching Committee project.641

The Tucson Township 14 Assembly appears to have been renamed Tucson Suburban Area
North and after Assembly elections in 1956 its status was first reported as

> “undetermined,” and by August it was reported it had lost its Assembly status642
(presumably due to an inadequate number o f Bahà’is).

In May 1954, a Local Assembly was reported formed in Yuma,643 but it lost its Assembly
> status by 1955 because it lacked the required number o f Bahà’is.644 However, in April
1956, it was restored to Assembly status.645

In July 1954, the Tucson Assembly had reported that their community’s first legal
Bahà’i marriage had taken place.646

Two cablegrams from Shoghi Effendi in 1954 pertained to Freemasonry and stated,
“Disapprove membership (in) Freemasonry” (November 11, 1954); “Any Bahà’i
determined retain membership (in) Freemasonry loses voting rights” (December 22, 1954).
The National Assembly noted that the directive was an application o f the general principle
Shoghi Effendi “laid down some years ago” that “Bahà’is are not to affiliate with
organizations, any o f whose purposes and methods contradict fundamental principles o f
the Bahà’i teachings.”647 Toward the end o f the 1950s, Phoenix Bahà’is Clinton and
Miriam Bugbee and Clarice Eichenauer chose to remain in their respective Masonic Order
and Eastern Star organizations and forfeited their membership in the Bahà’i Faith. The
Bugbees apparently had invested money in Freemasonry that included pre-paid burial, an
arrangement they chose not to give up. Clarice Eichenauer (mother o f John) was later re­
instated as a Bahà’i.648 She died in March 2002 at the age o f 106.649

John Eichenauer, following his pilgrimage to the Bahà’i World Centre in 1956, went on
to pioneer in Monterey, Mexico, for two years and assisted the formation o f Monterey’s

> first Local Spiritual Assembly.650 He currently (year 2004) resides in Phoenix where he
continues serving the Faith.

By 1956 Zahrah Schoeny, who relocated with husband and family to Tucson in 1948 for
the formation o f the Assembly there, had returned to Phoenix and the Schoeny home at

> 302 West Portland, apparently confident that the continuation o f a Tucson Assembly was
> assured. Correct in that assessment, the Tucson Bahà’i community has expanded in
membership over the years and has maintained its Assembly status.

Also by 1956, there were five Local Spiritual Assemblies in Arizona: Phoenix, Phoenix
Suburban Area North (earlier known as “North Phoenix,” it apparently was annexed to the
incorporated City o f Phoenix sometime between October 1958 and October 1959),
Tempe, Tucson, and Yuma (which lost its Assembly status by April 1957).651

Among the early Arizona Bahà’is mentioned who left their communities to settle in
locations with either few or no Bahà’is or who responded to serve in other lands, was
Nina Ruppers Seibert. She and her daughter, Carol (in year 2004, known as Carol Agahi
o f Phoenix) moved to Lincoln, Nebraska, as Bahà’i homefront pioneers there— Carol had
turned twenty-one so both were instrumental in the formation o f the first Local Spiritual
Assembly o f Lincoln, Nebraska, and both were members o f the Assembly. Eventually,
Nina went on to pioneer in Panama where a Bahà’i school was named after her. She had
dropped the name Nina, which she wasn’t fond of and in its place adopted her middle
name, Virginia.652

The Bahà’is in Arizona during the early period covered by this history were very
representative o f the early Bahà’is in general— dedicated, devoted and committed
individuals who translated their love and devotion for Bahà’u ’ilàh, the Bahà’i Faith and its
teachings, into action and deeds o f service. A solid core o f individuals built a firm
foundation for the Faith in Arizona. They did it with an eagerness, exertion o f effort, and
perseverance, during the extremely disruptive conditions o f two world wars and the Great
Depression and they achieved promised victories for the Faith.

AMELIA ENGELDER COLLINS

1 8 7 3 -1 9 6 2

Louetta Engelder, who was married to Amelia’s brother Oscar, provided the following
information (unless designated otherwise) on the dates noted.

> Amelia was a housekeeper for her oldest brother, Conrad, when she and Thomas
> Collins met in Calumet, Michigan. * Conrad was a minister in Calumet. (Notes of
> present writer’s conversation with Louetta Engelder on July 21, 1977.)

> Amelia Engelder and Thomas Hoatson Collins were married [on August 22, 1895]
> at Marwood, Pennsylvania, outside o f Butler. Milly’s father married them. Her
> father was a Lutheran minister there and lived in the parsonage. Milly had been
> away from home taking care o f her brother Conrad in Calumet, Michigan. (Notes
> from writer’s conversation with Louetta Engelder on March 9, 1979.)

> Tom ’s relatives and friends were interested in mining and they had Tom go to
> Arizona [in the late 1890s?] to look over possible mining property. He and Walter
> Douglas dickered over buying the Irish Mag mine property. Tom was responsible
> for choosing the land that was bought and he became a director. It was the
> Hoatson family— his mother’s family and their friends—that bought the stock.
> Tom and Amelia Collins left Bisbee in 1904. They had made their fortune before
> that. The Calumet and Arizona Mine [see endnote 18], associated with the
> Hoatson family, became Phelps Dodge after the Depression. Louetta Engelder said
> it would be fair to say that the generous financial contributions Milly made to the
> Faith had their origins in the wealth from the Collinses’ financial interests in
> Arizona mining businesses. (July 21, 1977.)

> Thomas Hoatson Collins’ Hoatson relatives sent him out to Bisbee from Michigan
> (to oversee the copper mining business that his uncle, “Captain” Jim Hoatson, had
> become involved in). Tom and Milly lived on Quality Hill in Bisbee, where Mike
> Brophy or “Baldy” E. B. Mason lived. Tom exercised his wisdom in “picking up
> property that no one else saw [copper mining] potential for.” Mr. Frank Cullen
> Brophy complimented Tom’s wisdom and foresight and said Tom was “closely
> connected with Bisbee.” (Notes from conversation of Lou Engelder and Maureen
> Thur with Mr. Frank C. Brophy at his Phoenix home, July 1977.)

* Portraits o f Some Bahd'i Women by O. Z. Whitehead, George Ronald, 1996, states (p. 74), “When M illy was a
young girl, she and her brothers visited in Copper Harbor, Michigan. Here she met Thomas H. Collins, whom she
later married.”

According to Louetta Engelder, Tom and Amelia Collins left Bisbee, Arizona, around
1904 and visited Europe, then returned to Calumet, Michigan; they visited various mines
and visited in Pasadena, California. By 1904, Tom had acquired their considerable wealth
from the [copper] mining business.

> Mr. Thomas and Mrs. Amelia Collins had a farm called “Ahk-in-doony” [phonetic
> spelling]— Scottish for “house on the hill”— in Princeton, Massachusetts, located
> forty or so miles from Boston. They had purchased the farmland about 1915 and
> had a house built. They had a small model o f the house made prior to building it,
> wherein every piece of furniture, etc., was represented. By 1919 the Collinses were
> occupying it. It was in this house that “Milly” received the Tablet from ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá [complete text is at the end o f this APPENDIX], She had expected to spend
> the rest o f her life there but Tom Collins did not want to stay there because it was
> too “dead”— too far from people he wanted to visit with. Louetta Engelder felt
> Tom preferred the atmosphere o f California. They had cattle on the farm and fruit
> trees. Milly had the fruit canned— “she was very thrifty, she wasn’t going to have
> anything go to waste.” (Notes from conversation o f Maureen Thur with Louetta
> Engelder on July 17, 1979.)

> The Collinses had spent their winters in Pasadena, California. (Shortly after 1919
> they sold the Massachusetts farm, per Louetta Engelder.) Between 1928 and 1930
> they were living at the Vista Del Arroyo (near the Rose Bowl), a very exclusive
> hotel in Pasadena. Tom’s aunt, Mrs. Thomas Hoatson, was living on Los Feliz in
> Hollywood and took. . . (Louetta Engelder to show her) where Milly was going to
> build a beautiful new home in Pacific Palisades.* Milly and Tom lived in the house
> about two years when Tom died. After Tom died, Milly sold the house to actor
> Charles Laughton. She visited Mr. Laughton there on at least a couple occasions.

Mr. Laughton sold the house to a Spanish lady.

> After Tom died (1937), Milly went to see Shoghi Effendi in Haifa and he took her
> up into the Bahà’i Gardens and talked with her. She didn’t get a chance to tell him
> all her problems as she intended, and on return to serving on the National
> Assembly, she found she was prepared through her visit with Shoghi Effendi
> regarding certain matters concerning Bahà’i administration. Before Tom died, he
> had made arrangements for Milly to live with Oscar and Louetta by buying five
> acres next to their Phoenix area home, saying his “pump” (heart) wasn’t too good.
> Tom then said he could “go happily; I only have two wishes”— one, knowing “that
> you [Oscar] and Lou take care o f Milly the rest o f her life, and (two) I want to go
> to Geyserville to see Collins Hall, the dorm and the little bridge.” Oscar said he
> would take care o f Milly. Milly went to Louetta—“would you like to do something
> for Tom, Lou?” Milly asked Louetta to give Tom a hooked rug she’d made that

* A book that was in the possession o f Mabel Helmick (deceased) in Phoenix had a small 1932 calendar in the front
along with the name “Am elia E. Collins” with the address “ 14954 Corona Del Mar, Pacific Palisades [California].”

Tom went home. Tom wasn’t well. Milly suggested they (she and Tom) take a

> and was taken off the boat in Rotterdam, Holland, and he died either then or on

Miscellaneous notes about Amelia and Tom Collins by Maureen Thur, some related by
Louetta Engelder and some from personal knowledge.

> Louetta and Oscar were very close to Milly and Tom Collins and, after the death
> o f her husband, Milly stayed with her brother and his wife in their Phoenix area
> home, sometimes for extended periods. As Milly developed arthritis, she would
> come from the Holy Land to Phoenix for its warm climate and medical attention.
> At first, the address of the Engelders’ home was Route 2, Box 394; later the
> address changed to 7540 N. 7th Street. A room was built onto the house for Milly.

After the death of Oscar, Louetta sold the property that was then re-developed.

Louetta Engelder told the present writer that during a difficult period in Amelia’s married
life, Amelia wrote a letter to ‘Abdu’l-Bahà about a personal problem (Louetta didn’t
identify the problem).653 However, Amelia decided not to send the letter and tossed it into
the fireplace where it was burned. Shortly thereafter, Amelia received a Tablet from
‘Abdu’l-Bahá in which Milly said her concerns were answered, unasked. O. Z. Whitehead
in Portraits o f Some Bahá 7                                      en,page 74, most likely documents the problem:

> om
> W
seems that while Tom was serving his country in Paris in World War I [One] he fell in love
with a nurse. On his return to the United States he asked Milly for a divorce. Deeply
shocked by his request, she flatly refused to grant it. He was furious and vowed he would
leave her virtually nothing in his will. Milly did not change her mind. Her spiritual strength
and adherence to high principles saved their marriage.”

The following Tablet from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Amelia Collins is faithfully copied from a
carbon (or mimeographed?) copy received by Maureen Thur from Louetta Engelder:

To the maid-servant of God, Mrs. Collins,

care his honor Mr. Harlan F. Ober, Boston, Mass. U.S.A.

Upon her be BahaVUah el Abha.

He Is GOD!

O thou lady of the Kingdom!

Praise thou God that in this century—
the century of the Dispensation of Baha’o’llah—thou hast been
awakened, hast been made aware of the manifestation of the Lord of
Hosts. All the people of the world are buried in the graves of
nature or are slumbering, heedless and unaware. Just as His Holiness,
Christ says: “I may come when you are not aware. The coming of the
Son of Man is like the coming of a thief into a house, the owner of
which is utterly unaware.”

In brief, from the bounties of His Holiness Baha’o’llah my
hope is that thou mayest daily advance in the Kingdom, that thou
mayest become a heavenly angel, confirmed by the breaths of the
Holy Spirit, and may erect a structure that shall eternally remain
firm and unshakable.

The contribution thou hast given for the propagation of the
Lights of the Kingdom has been highly acceptable and the Committee
on Teaching in America will expend this sum for Teaching the Cause
of God.

Convey on my behalf to thy respected husband respectful
greetings and say to him— “These days are very precious; grasp the
present opportunity and ignite a candle that shall never be
extinguished and which shall pour out It’s [s/c] light eternally and
illumine the world of mankind!”

Upon thee be Baha el Abha.

ORCELLA REXFORD
(Louise Cutts-Powell)

18 8 7 -1 9 4 6

> “Planning in her youth to become a college professor, she [Orcella] attended the
> University o f California at Berkeley, where she studied four languages and majored in
> education and domestic science. On receiving her Bachelor of Science degree, she took
> graduate work in philosophy and psychology, found her interests changing, and became a
writer and lecturer.

The name ‘Orcella Rexford’ is a cryptogram, made up o f letters chosen for her by an
> acquaintance... To Orcella this name symbolized her wish to link her personality to cosmic
forces for good, which would give her the greatest impetus for development.”

She became a Bahà’i “in 1918-1919....‘Abdu’l-Bahà’s newly-revealed Tablets of the
> Divine Plan called for pioneers to spread the Faith. In response, Orcella set out for Alaska
> in 1922....The first Alaskan to accept the Faith through Orcella was Gayne V. Gregory,
who soon became the husband o f his teacher and. . . [he] gave up his extensive dental

> practice to serve as business manager of Orcella’s lecture tours.. .conducting classes on
> various subjects (among other topics, such as diet, she did much to popularize the use of
> color in clothing and in household furnishings and utensils, at that time traditionally drab)
> she would refer her students to a lecture that would follow the paid series o f talks, and
would bring them a knowledge that was beyond price. This final talk was on the advent of
Bahà’u ’ilàh. Invariably, she left a Bahà’i study class, which was then conducted by other
Bahà’i teachers. That her method was successful is proved by the large numbers of
Bahà’is who first learned o f the Faith through Orcella. In Denver [in 1930], for example,
eighteen hundred people attended. . . on each o f two nights to hear Orcella speak on the
Cause, and a study class of four hundred and thirty-five people resulted.” (Bahá 7           ,
vol. 11, 1946-1950, pp. 495-496, ‘In Memoriam.’)

Phoenix Bahà’i Pearl Schoeny changed her first name to “Zahrah” based on a technique
used and practiced by Orcella. The Schoenys also sought Orcella’s recommendation for
the names o f some o f the Schoeny children. The present writer’s collection contains a
copy o f a telegram dated May 11, 1935, that was sent by “Paul A. Schoeny” to Orcella in
San Francisco: “Boy arrived eight ten this morning [stop] Zahrah and baby fine [stop]
name please [stop].” The baby boy was named “Zahrl” .

In her biography o f Louis Gregory, To Move the World (p. 236), Gayle Morrison refers
to a letter written on behalf o f Shoghi Effendi to Louis Gregory in 1932 regarding the kind
o f work that Mr. Gregory should pursue. Shoghi Effendi advised Mr. Gregory not to
pursue the “kind o f work Miss [Orcella] Rexford has.. .for even though there is no harm in
it, it may cause misunderstanding. The people may confuse what you say on the subject of
the Cause with what you say in your other lectures.”

By 1943 the National Assembly had prepared a statement “defining the relationship
between Miss Orcella Rexford’s teaching activities and the Bahà’i administrative body of

the city in which her work is being carried on.” A letter containing the statement was sent
to local Assemblies o f the cities in which Miss Rexford would be conducting her lectures.
Among the six specific issues addressed, the statement explained that “her lectures and
classes on non-Bahá’í subjects” were “to be entirely dissociated from the Bahà’i Faith.” It
also explained how the process o f the follow-up study classes was to proceed to the point
where the group would be turned over to a Bahà’i administrative body for “direct and
continuous Bahà’i instruction.” The sixth and concluding item was that Local Assemblies
were requested to appreciate that Miss Rexford was capable o f establishing large study
classes and this presented an opportunity for increasing Bahà’i membership and promoting
the Faith. (Letter dated February 9, 1943, “To the Spiritual Assembly” with the letterhead
o f the National Assembly and signed by Horace Holley, Secretary.)*

Orcella had been in the Phoenix area in late 1942 and spoke to students at a Glendale
High School assembly. (Nina Seibert was appointed “follow up teacher” .)654

“While visiting Phoenix, Orcella was injured in a fall, which ended her professional
career as a lecturer. In Hollywood to regain her health, she was active in teaching and
administrative work.” (                         B ahà’iWorld, vol. 11, 1946-1950, p. 496.)

A Los Angeles Bahà’i newsletter655 reported that Orcella died at her Los Angeles,
California, home in August 1946 and that Mr. and Mrs. (Zahrah) Paul Schoeny, Bahà’is of
Phoenix, assisted Orcella’s husband in making arrangements for Orcella to be buried near
the grave site o f Thornton Chase (called by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “the first American Bahà’i”) at
the Inglewood Cemetery in Inglewood, California. Paul Schoeny sang at Orcella’s funeral
service “ending with the Bahà’i Benediction,” the a cappella hymn that he frequently sang
at Bahà’i events in Phoenix and elsewhere.

*A photocopy o f an original letter is in the present writer’s collection. The original o f it is in the possession o f Robert
Cadwalader, Watsonville, California— it was among the items o f Phoenix Bahà’i, Zahrah Schoeny (deceased, 1978),
when they were being disposed o f and were made available to all the Bahà’is o f the area.

addition to A rizon a v o tin g lists dated 1958 through 1966 but n one dated prior to 1957). T h e one cited
here appears to refer to a year prior to 1957 and is assum ed to be 1 9 5 6 because th e total num ber o f
B a h à ’is is less than 1957 and later years, and because o f the variation s in lists o f A ssem b lies, Groups and
