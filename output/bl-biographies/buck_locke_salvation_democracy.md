## Alain Locke: Bahá'í Principles and the Salvation of Democracy

### by [Christopher Buck](https://bahai-library.com/author/Christopher+Buck)

2007


> **Abstract:** The Chautauqua Institution is a center for the arts, education, and religion. This presentation focuses on Alain Locke's philosophy of democracy in nine dimensions, with corresponding references to statements by the Bahá’í International Community, the Bahá’í Writings, and by the Universal House of Justice on the positive aspects of democracy as good governance. Alain Locke, who joined the Bahá'í Faith in 1918 (the same year that he was awarded his PhD in philosophy from Harvard University) has provided a greatly expanded framework for democracy studies, in what may be considered to be a comprehensive view of democracy in its various economic, social, cultural and religious applications.

In the clustered jewels of the races may
the blacks be as sapphires and rubies and

Bahá’í Principles & the Salvation of Democracy

1885–1954

Democracy Defined
Alain Locke • (MSRC, Box 164-141, Folder 14)
In a democracy built out of many peoples by this
great historical process of immigration, the only safe
principle of democracy is that embodied in this
conception of democracy:(A democracy is a system of
government and corporate living in which there is no
distinction between minority and majority rights; and under
4hich life is safe and equa"y abundant for a" minorities. In
historical perspective/,0 this is really the distinctive
foundation/al0 principle of American life. Our task
today is to make America truly and consistently
American.

Democracy Widened

Locke • Talladega College (1941)
Democracy, of course, is one of the basic human
ideals, but as an ideal of human association it is
something quite superior to any outward institution
or any particular society.
Therefore, not only is government too narrow to
express democracy, but government from time to
time must grow to realize democracy.

Democracy Achieved
Locke • “Stretching Our Social Mind” (1944,

unpub.)
> Just as world#mindedness must dominate and
> remould nation#mindedness, so we must transfor+
> eventua"y race(mindedness into human(mindedness.
> The intelligent and e.ective righting of our racial
> wrongs and handicaps involves pleading and righting
> the cause of any and all oppressed minorities.

Local Democracy
Locke • Talladega College (1941)
It may be a little daring in the time we have at our disposal, but let
us put on seven#league boots and trace democracy(one of the
great social concepts. Both in concept and in practice democracy
began in Greece(in the Greek city state. In its day it was a grea-
achievement, but in that day democracy was a concept of local citizenship.

Our nearest approach to it is the kind of fellowship we $nd in
college fraternities and sororities in which the bonds are of %like#
mindedness& excluding others. The rim of the Greek concept of
democracy was the barbarian: it was then merely the principle of
fraternity within a narrow, limited circle. There was a dignity
accorded to each member on the basis of membership in the
group. It excluded foreigners, slaves and women.

Local Democracy
Bahá’í Principle—“Family and Social

Development” (June 1994)
The family is the $rst environment to teach the values of
democracy, human rights, social responsibility, tolerance
and peace, enabling their individual members to
contribute to the $ght against poverty as advocates for
social justice.
Social progress implies the constant and dynamic
interaction between family structure and functions and
the larger social, economic, cultural and physical
environment.

Local Democracy
Bahá’í Principle—UHJ to NSA (10 April 2001)

> But considered in its local sphere alone there is much to
> thrill and amaze the heart. Here it links the individual
> to the collective processes by which a society is built or
> restored. Here, for instance, the Feast is an arena of
> democracy at the very root of society, where the Local
> Spiritual Assembly and the members of the community
> meet on common ground, where individuals are free to
> o.er their gifts of thought, whether as new ideas or
> constructive criticism, to the building processes of an
> advancing civilization.

Moral Democracy
Locke • Talladega College (1941)
Christianity was responsible for the introduction of the next
great revision in the concept of democracy. We owe to
Christianity one of the great basic ideals of democracy,the ideal of
the moral equality of human beings. The Christian ideal of
democracy was in its initial stages more democratic than it
subsequently became. …

Christianity was thus a crusading ideal in bringing humanity
into wider association. But the Christian church was a political
institution and in making compromises often failed in bringing
about real human equality.

Moral Democracy
Bahá’í Principle—BIC, “The Search for Values in

an Age of Transition” (October 2005)
> We commend the international community for its commitment
> to democracy and to a freely elected government as a universal
> value. … Beyond the administration of material a.airs,
governance is a moral exercise.

> A healthy democracy must be founded on the principle of the
> equality of men and women and equal recognition of their
> contribution to the establishment of a just society. In its e.orts
> to promote democracy, the Member States of the United
> Nations must vigilantly work for the inclusion of women in all
> facets of governance in their respective countries.

Political Democracy

Locke • Talladega College (1941)
The third great step in democracy came :om Protestant lands and
people who evolved the ideal of political equality: !1"
equality before the law; political citizenship.
This political democracy pivoted on individualism, and th%
:eedom of the individual in terms of what we know as th%
fundamental rights of man. It found its best expression in the
historic formula of %Liberty, equality and fraternity.& …
In the perspective of democracy)s long evolution, we must regard
our country)s history as a progressive process of democratization,
not yet fu"y achieved.

Political Democracy
Bahá’í Principle—One Common Faith (2006)
A widely quoted passage in Bah,)u)ll,h)s Tablet to Queen
Victoria expresses emphatic praise of the principle of
democratic and constitutional government …
In other passages, Bah,)u)ll,h spells out some of the practical
implications. The governments of the world are called upon
to convene an international consultative body as the
foundation, in the words of the Guardian, of %a world federal
system& empowered to safeguard the autonomy and territory
of its state members, resolve national and regional disputes
and coordinate programmes of global development for the
good of the entire human race.

Political Democracy
Bahá’í Principle—BIC, “The Search for Values in

an Age of Transition” (October 2005)
> We commend the international community for its commitment
> to democracy and to a freely elected government as a universal
> value. What is needed is a consultative process 11 at all levels of
> governance …
> Through participation and unity of purpose, consultation
> becomes the operating expression of justice in human a.airs.
> Without this principled anchor, democracy falls prey to the
> excesses of individualism and nationalism, which tear at the
> fabric of the community ( both nationally and globally.

Economic Democracy
The fourth crucial stage in the enlargement of democracy began,
I think, with the income tax amendment. Woodrow Wilson tried
to put into operation /as0 an extension of democracy … In this
country for many generations we thought we had economic
equality.

What we really had was a frontier expansion which developed
such surpluses and o.ered such practical equality of opportunity
as to give us the illusion of economic equality. We later learned
that we did not have economic democracy, and that in order to have this,
4e must have guaranteed to a" citizens certain minimal standards of
living and the right to earn a living.

Economic Democracy
Bahá’í Principle—“Bahá'í International
Community: History of Active Cooperation with

the United Nations” (2000)
> Economic justice and cooperation. A vision of
> human prosperity in the fullest sense of the term#an
> awakening to the possibilities of the spiritual and
> material well#being of all the planet)s inhabitants#will
> help galvanize the collective will to overcome such
> barriers to peace as the inordinate disparity between
> rich and poor.

Cultural Democracy
This !0h phase is the stru8le for cultural democracy, and rests on the concep-
of the right of di1erence,,that is, the guarantee of the rights of minorities.
Again in the colonial days, we achieved the basic ideals of this crucial
aspect of democracy, but scarcely realized them in fact. …

These contemporary problems of democracy can be vividly sensed if
we realize that the race question is at the very heart of this stru8le for
cultural democracy. …

The fact that a man cannot a.ord to buy a decent house for his
family involves the problem of economic inequality; but … the ma#
4ho through social prejudice is refused the purchase of a house though he ca#
a1ord to buy it con:onts us with an example of cultural inequality.

Cultural Democracy
Bahá’í Principle—“Development, Democracy

and Human Rights” (1993)
Without economic rights, the exercise of civil or
social rights is severely attenuated. Without cultural
rights, an individual or community will have the
greatest di*culty in exercising political or economic
rights to a degree that meets the essential
requirements of their respective situations.

Cultural Democracy
Bahá’í Principle—“Development, Democracy

and Human Rights” (1993)
Every individual needs the assurance that the
exercise of the faculties referred to will enjoy access
to whatever bene$ts, protections, and opportunities
can reasonably be provided by the society in which
he or she lives.
These bene$ts include … not only civil and political
rights, but also rights in the area of economic, social,
and cultural life.

Racial Democracy
Locke • The Washington Star (7 Nov. 1943)
There must be complete consistency between what
democracy professes and what democracy practices.
Public opinion in America has got to be sold on
racial democracy. Now is the time for the people to
face this question. Race equality alone can secure world
peace. …
To save the United States from moral bankruptcy we
must solve the color problem.

Racial Democracy
Bahá’í Principle—BIC, “One Same

Substance” (2001)
Racism originates not in the skin but in the human mind.
Further, the principle of the oneness of humanity exposes
any attempt to distinguish separate %races& or %peoples& in
the contemporary world as arti$cial and misleading. While
racial, national and/or ethnic heritage can be considered as
sources of pride and even a backdrop for positive social
development, such distinctions should not become a basis
for new forms of separation or superiority, however subtle.

Racial Democracy
Bahá’í Principle—BIC, “The Search for Values in

an Age of Transition” (October 2005)
> The meaningful integration of minority groups in
> democratic processes is of critical importance ( both to
> shield minorities from the abuses of the past and to
> encourage their participation and responsibility for the
> well#being of society.
> We urge Member States, in their work to promote
> democracy, to strive for the full inclusion of minorities (
> belonging to any faith, race, or class ( in the processes of
> goal#setting and deliberation.

Social Democracy
Locke • “Teaching Democracy” (unpub.)
It is a sad irony that the social institution most
committed and potentially most capable of
implementing social democracy should actually be the
weakest and most inconsistent, organized religion.
Of a" the segregated bodies, the racia"y separate church is th%
saddest and most obviously self(contradicting. The separate
Negro church, organized in self#defensive protest, is
nonetheless just as anaomolous /sic0, though perhaps,
more pardonably so.

Social Democracy
Locke • 17th Bahá’í Congress (1925)
The working out of social democracy can be accomplished
here. To this end we should not think in little arcs of
experience, but in the big, comprehensive way. Let
our country reform its own heart and life. Needed
reforms cannot be worked out by the action of any
one group, but a $ne sense of cooperation must
secure universal fellowship. …

In !nal analysis, peace cannot exist anywhere withou-
existing everywhere.

Social Democracy
Bahá’í Principle—One Common Faith (2006)
Democratic decision#making has fundamentally
altered the relationship of the individual to
authority.
The Bah,)- community today comprises several
million people representative of virtually every
ethnic, cultural, social and religious background on
earth, administering their collective a.airs without
the intervention of a clergy, through democratically
elected institutions.

Spiritual Democracy
Locke • “The Gospel of the Twentieth Century”

> The gospel for the Twentieth Century rises out of the
> heart of its greatest problems. … Much has bee#
> accomplished in the name of Democracy, but Spiritual
> Democracy, its largest and most inner meaning, is so below
> our common horizons.
> And we must begin heroically with the great apparent
> irreconcilables; the East and the West, the black ma#
> and the self(arrogating Anglo(Saxon, for unless these ar%
> reconciled, the salvation of society in this world cannot be.

Spiritual Democracy
Locke • “The Gospel of the Twentieth Century”

> The word of God is sti" insistent, and more emphatic as th%
> human redemption delays and becomes more crucial, and we
> have what Dr. Elsemont /Esslemont0 rightly calls
> Bah6)u)"6h)s .one great trumpet(ca" to humanity/:
> %That all nations shall become one in faith, and all men as
> brothers; that the bonds of a.ection and unity between
> the sons of men should be strengthened; that diversity of
> religion should cease, and di1erences of race be annu"ed …
> These strifes and this bloodshed and discord must cease,
> and all men be as one kindred and family./&0

Spiritual Democracy
Bahá’í Principle—One Common Faith (2006)
Throughout history, the primary agents of spiritual
development have been the great religions. …
At the social level, the resulting moral principles
have repeatedly translated themselves into universal
codes of law, regulating and elevating human
relationships.
Viewed in perspective, the major religions emerge as
the primary driving forces of the civilizing process.

World Democracy
Locke • “Town Meeting” (1 June 1942)
The fact is, the idealistic exponents of world unity and
human brotherhood have throughout the ages and even
today expected their $gs to grow from thistles.
We cannot expect to get international bread :om sociological ston%
4hether it be the granite of national self(su$ciency, the *int of
racial antagonisms, or the adamant of religious partisanship. . . .
The question pivots, therefore, not on the desirability of
world unity, but upon the more realistic issue of its
practicability.

World Democracy
Locke • KMYR, Denver (6 August 1944)
Just as the foundation of democracy as a national
principle made necessary the declaration of the basic
equality of persons, so the founding of international
democracy must guarantee the basic equality of
human groups.

World Democracy
Bahá’í Principle—Century of Light (2001)
The process leading to the election of the Universal House of
Justice /19630(made possible by the successful completion of
the three initial stages of the Master)s Divine Plan under the
leadership of Shoghi E.endi(very likely constituted history)s
$rst global democratic election. !92"

… the speci$c provisions requiring the free and democratic
election by the mass of the faithful of the Body that constitutes
the sole legislative organ in the world#wide Baha)i community ##
these are among the features which combine to set apart the
Order identi$ed with the Revelation of Baha)u)llah from any of
the existing systems of human government.& !GPB 326"

World Democracy
Bahá’í Principle—BIC, “Perspective: Some

Thoughts on Elections” (2001)
The rise of democracy and democratic processes worldwide
is a positive trend. …
There are currently some 180 National Spiritual Assemblies
around the world, and in some countries they represent one
of the few truly democratic institutions in existence. …
Nevertheless, the world at large can learn much from a
thorough study of Bah,)- election procedures and practices.

Salvation of Democracy
Locke • “America’s Part in World Peace” (1925)

> America)s democracy must begin at home with a
> spiritual fusion of all her constituent peoples in
> brotherhood, and in an actual mutuality of life. …
> Until it establishes itself in human hearts, it can
> never institutionally 2ourish. …
> Bah6); Principles and the leavening of our national lif%
> 4ith their power, is to be regarded as the salvation of
> democracy. In this way only can the $ne professions of
> American ideals be realized.

> Salvation of Democracy
Bahá’í Principle—BIC, “The Prosperity of

Humankind” (3 March 1995)
The institutions of society will succeed in eliciting and
directing the potentialities latent in the consciousness of
the world)s peoples to the extent that the exercise of
authority is governed by principles that are in harmony
with the evolving interests of a rapidly maturing human
race.
Clearly, such principles can operate only within a culture
that is essentially democratic in spirit and method.

> “Find your larger self in some
group project and realize the

> philosophy of a fine African
proverb that says, ‘Through

others I am somebody.’”
“The highest education is the

education that has the
greatest social coefficient; the

lowest that has the largest
personal coefficient, certainly
if that be purchased at the
sacrifice of the former.”

— Alain Locke, “The
Command of the Spirit”
