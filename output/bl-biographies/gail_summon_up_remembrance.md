## Summon Up Remembrance

### by [Marzieh Gail](https://bahai-library.com/author/Marzieh+Gail)

Oxford: George Ronald, 1987


> **Abstract:** The fascinating story of a pleasure-seeking Persian boy who became one of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's leading English translators and united East and West in the first Persian-American Bahá'í marriage. Here is the colourful story of Ali-Kuli Khan, the first to translate into English such important works as the 'Seven Valleys', the 'Kitáb-i-Íqán', and the Glad-Tidings. Told by his daughter, herself a well-known author and translator, Khan's story is based on his memoirs and personal papers. Through them we are given a unique and detailed picture of life in Persia at the end of the century, complete with an explanation of that oft-met protocol 'ta'áruf'. We follow the young Khan, dressed as a dervish, on his adventurous walk to 'Akká and note his transformation from a frivolous youth to a skilled translator for 'Abdu'l-Bahá. In his nearly two years as a member of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's household, Khan both translated for those first groups of American pilgrims to visit the Holy Land and rendered 'Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets into English. In 1901 Khan was sent to America to assist Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl and to translate the great teacher's book, The Bahá'í Proofs, into English. It was in America that Khan met and fell in love with a Boston society girl, Florence Breed. Their Victorian romance unfolds in the delicate love-letters written by Florence to Khan. Their marriage, the first between a Persian and an American Bahá'í, not only symbolized but portrayed the unity between East and West taught by the Bahá'í Faith. _Summon Up Remembrance_ is peopled with such familiar figures as Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl, Laura Barney, Edward and Lua Getsinger, Mary Hanford Ford and the Atábak. But this is a book dedicated to 'Abdu'l-Bahá, and it is His wisdom and teaching that characterizes it. A unique feature is the inclusion of the Tablet of Cremation revealed by 'Abdu'l-Bahá, here published for the first time in English in a new translation by the Research Department of the Universal House of Justice. The story continues in [_Arches of the Years._](http://bahai-library.com/gail_arches_years)
