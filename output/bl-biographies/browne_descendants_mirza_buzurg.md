    This list was sent to me in June, 1912, by the already-mentioned Azalí scribe of Isfahán, resident in Tihrán, with whom I succeeded in establishing relations, and who supplied me with numerous precious documents. The original is written, not very distinctly, by a certain Mírzá Ibráhím Khán, the son of Fátima Khánim, the niece of Mírzá Buzurg's daughter (the half-sister of both Bahá'u'lláh and Subh-i-Azal) Sháh Sultán Khánim, commonly known as _Hájji_ (or _Hájjiya_) _Khánim-i- Buzurg_. It is accompanied by a more legible transcript by the aforesaid scribe.

    Mirzá Buzurg seems to have had six wives (unnamed in the list) who bore him children, and who are here distinguished by Roman numbers.

> I.
> 
> (1) Mírzá Yahyá _Subh-i-Azal_.
> 
> II.
> 
> (2) Mírzá Husayn 'Ali _Bahá'u'lláh_: (3) Mírzá Músá _Kalimu'lláh_1, who followed Bahá: (4) an unnamed daughter
> 
> III.
> 
> (5) Mírzá Muhammad Hasan (Azalí).
> 
> IV.
> 
> (6) Mírzá-quli: (7) an unnamed daughter (both Bahá'ís).

    1 The only one of Mirza Musa's sons with whom I was acquainted was Majdu'd-Din, but he had three other sons named 'Ali Rizá, Jamil and Kamál.
