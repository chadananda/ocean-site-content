Yahyá, Mírzá (c. 1831–1912)
Younger half-brother of Bahá’u’lláh; follower of the Báb, who conferred on him a
high station and leading role in the Bábí community; later, opponent of
Bahá’u’lláh; known as Azal (Eternity or Pre-eternity) and Subh-i-Azal (Morning of
Eternity), leading to his followers becoming known as Azalís; described by Shoghi
Effendi as "the arch-breaker of the Covenant of the Báb." 1

1844, Mírzá Yahyá was one of several of Bahá’u’lláh’s full- and half-siblings who became Bábís.

In December 1848 Mírzá Yahyá was a member of a small party led by
Bahá’u’lláh that was arrested in Mazandaran near the Bábí fortress at
Shaykh Tabarsí, to which they were bringing provisions. The entire party
was taken in shackles to Amul, where the prisoners were interrogated
and threatened with being bastinadoed or executed. Bahá’u’lláh insisted
on bearing punishment on behalf of His companions, and His feet were
beaten until they bled. Subsequently, He and the rest of the party were
freed but prohibited from reaching their destination.

By May 1849 virtually all the Bábís at Shaykh Tabarsí had been killed,
and the role of leadership had fallen increasingly on Bahá’u’lláh. The
Báb, imprisoned in the remote mountains of Azerbaijan, wrote letters
that conferred on the teenaged Mírzá Yahyá a high station and leading
role, giving him such titles as Mir’átu’l-Azalíyyih (Everlasting Mirror),
Ismu’l-Azal (Name of Eternity), and Thamara-i-Azalíyyih (the Eternal
Fruit). Subh-i-Azal appears to have been a title that Mírzá Yahyá took
for himself.

Bahá’u’lláh later wrote in a passage addressed to Mírzá Yahyá,              Bahá’í Photographic Library

"remember how We nurtured thee by day and by night for service to
the Cause." 2 Under Bahá’u’lláh’s guidance, Mírzá Yahyá gained an extensive familiarity with the writings
of the Báb but remained reclusive and demonstrated limited ability for leadership. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has
explained that Mírzá Yahyá’s appointment as leader of the Bábís was a stratagem that Bahá’u’lláh, His
brother Mírzá Músá, and Mullá ‘Abdu’l-Karím Qazvíní, one of the Báb’s secretaries, devised, with the
Báb’s approval, to divert attention onto a little-known figurehead and away from Bahá’u’lláh, "though
He was known and seen." 3

At the time of the Báb’s execution in July 1850, Mírzá Yahyá, married while still in his teens, was living
with his wife and young child in his father’s native village of Tákur in Núr. Fearing arrest, he took
refuge in the mountains of Mazandaran, where he wandered in disguise. His position became more
vulnerable when Bahá’u’lláh, who continued to serve as his protector, was compelled by the prime
minister, Mírzá Taqí Khán, to leave Iran in June 1851. Bahá’u’lláh went to Iraq, effectively in exile, only
to be pardoned and summoned back nine months later by the new prime minister, Mírzá Áqá Khán.

On His return, Bahá’u’lláh learned of a conspiracy against Nasir al-Din Shah and the prime minister by
a disgruntled group of Bábís. Bahá’u’lláh condemned the plan and warned the chief plotter of the
disastrous consequences of such action. Just before the attempted assassination, which took place on
15 August 1852, Mírzá Yahyá, who was also aware of the plot, left the capital to rally the Bábís in
Tákur if the assassination proved successful. Instead, the plan misfired, resulting in reprisals against
the Bábís of Tehran, including Bahá’u’lláh, who was cast into a dungeon known as the Síyáh-Chál (Black
Pit). Attacks on the Bábís quickly spread to the remotest regions of the country.

Disguised as a dervish, Mírzá Yahyá fled Tákur. A cavalry regiment burned the village and terrorized the
countryside, looting and burning the mansion of Mírzá Buzurg. The reprisals continued until mid-
December 1852, when Bahá’u’lláh was released from prison, His properties were formally confiscated,
and He was ordered to leave Iran within a month.

In Iraq, 1853–63
Choosing Iraq as His place of exile, in January 1853 Bahá’u’lláh left for Baghdad, accompanied by His
family and by officials representing the Iranian government and the Russian Legation. The party
included His younger full-brother, Mírzá Músá, and sixteen-year-old half-brother, Muhammad Qulí. Mírzá
Yahyá, after leaving Tákur, headed west for Rasht and Qazvin. Unknown to the Bábís, he worked as a
seller of shrouds in Kirmanshah, on the edge of Kurdistan. There he met Bahá’u’lláh’s party en route to
Baghdad. Having been given a small sum of money that enabled him to travel, Mírzá Yahyá followed
Bahá’u’lláh to Baghdad, posing as a cotton merchant. He arrived about June 1853, two months after
Bahá’u’lláh. Mírzá Yahyá established his own residence in the Arab quarter of the city.

Since Mírzá Yahyá had not been banished, Bahá’u’lláh advised
him to return to Iran and guide the Bábís. Instead, Mírzá Yahyá
spent the next few years in hiding, under an assumed name,
sometimes in Baghdad and sometimes in Basra or elsewhere.
Even when Bábís loyal to him as the Báb’s nominee traveled
hundreds of miles to see him and were able to locate him, he
usually refused to see them. His reticence created a void that as
many as twenty-five claimants to leadership sought to fill.
                                                                            Historical view of Baghdad and the Tigris River. Date:

Bábís turned to Him for the support and leadership that was not
forthcoming from Mírzá Yahyá. Bahá’u’lláh’s favorable reputation spread beyond Bábí circles and
garnered increasing respect for the exiles.

While Bahá’u’lláh’s prestige grew, Mírzá Yahyá was joined in Baghdad by Siyyid Muhammad Isfahání, a
Bábí who had met Bahá’u’lláh during His visit to Karbala in 1851. Siyyid Muhammad, described by
Bahá’u’lláh in a passage addressed to Mírzá Yahyá as "him who led thee astray," 4 became Mírzá Yahyá’s
chief supporter. Incited by Siyyid Muhammad, Mírzá Yahyá became increasingly jealous of Bahá’u’lláh
and started to intrigue against Him, circulating rumors and stirring controversies.

Unwilling to speak out against His brother, Bahá’u’lláh decided to remove Himself from the situation. In
April 1854, with only one companion, He retired to Sargalu and Sulaymaniyah in Iraqi Kurdistan, where
He remained in seclusion for two years, living as a dervish. "The one object of Our retirement,"
Bahá’u’lláh later asserted, "was to avoid becoming a subject of discord among the faithful, a source of
disturbance unto Our companions, the means of injury to any soul, or the cause of sorrow to any
heart." 5

During Bahá’u’lláh’s absence, Mírzá Yahyá continued both to hide—much of the time as a guest in
Bahá’u’lláh’s home, which he closed to visitors—and to attack those whom he perceived as his enemies.
He denounced Mírzá Asadu’lláh Dayyán, a rival for the leadership of the Bábís, stating that Dayyán and
his supporters should be killed. While Bahá’u’lláh was away, Mírzá Yahyá also married the Báb’s second
wife and, shortly thereafter, gave her in marriage to Siyyid Muhammad Isfahání. Bahá’u’lláh later
described these actions as having dishonored the Báb. 6

By early 1856, when Bahá’u’lláh’s whereabouts finally became known and His family prevailed on Him to
return, the Bábís in Baghdad, including Mírzá Yahyá, had become thoroughly demoralized and
discredited. Bahá’u’lláh’s return to Baghdad regenerated the Bábí community there, which numbered
only some thirty or forty, and attracted the growing respect of officials and the general population.
However, Mírzá Yahyá continued to seek ways to strengthen his own position. Dayyán, who had
renounced his claims after traveling from Azerbaijan to meet Bahá’u’lláh, was assassinated while in
Baghdad. Mírzá Yahyá also ordered the murder of Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar, the Báb’s cousin and an admirer of
Dayyán.

In Turkey, 1863–68
In 1863 the Ottoman authorities summoned Bahá’u’lláh to Istanbul, yielding to concerted pressure from
the Iranian government to distance Bahá’u’lláh from His homeland and thereby reduce His growing
influence. Before His departure in April, Bahá’u’lláh entrusted Mírzá Yahyá with the task of
disseminating in Iran writings of the Báb that Mírzá Yahyá had previously transcribed. Instead, Mírzá
Yahyá proceeded to Mosul, where he joined Bahá’u’lláh’s retinue en route to Istanbul, going most of the
way in disguise even though the party included his own wives and Siyyid Muhammad Isfahání. When
Bahá’u’lláh was exiled from Istanbul to Edirne (Adrianople) in December 1863, Mírzá Yahyá and Siyyid
Muhammad Isfahání followed.

In Edirne, although Bahá’u’lláh and His companions were in difficult physical circumstances at first, the
favorable attitude of the authorities lessened the exiles’ fear of persecution. For the first time in many
years, Mírzá Yahyá emerged from hiding. He continued to intrigue, however. This time he entertained
plans to kill Bahá’u’lláh. About a year after their arrival in Edirne, Mírzá Yahyá himself poisoned
Bahá’u’lláh, causing Him to be ill for a month and to develop a tremor in His hand that He retained to
the end of His life. After this unsuccessful attempt, Mírzá Yahyá tried to induce Bahá’u’lláh’s barber to
cut His throat.

Bahá’u’lláh endeavored to protect His brother and the community by asking that the events not be
discussed. Nevertheless, the attempts on His life ultimately could not be concealed. Mírzá Yahyá, and
later his followers, denied these and other malevolent acts and laid the blame on Bahá’u’lláh. The
attempts to murder Bahá’u’lláh and the allegations surrounding them created an uproar among the
exiles, who had until then treated Mírzá Yahyá with deference.

In about March 1866, because of Mírzá Yahyá’s continuing intrigues, Bahá’u’lláh openly announced to
His brother His claim to be "He Whom God shall make manifest" (Man Yuzhiruhu’lláh), the messianic
Figure prophesied by the Báb. Mírzá Yahyá was aware of Bahá’u’lláh’s declaration of His station to His
followers nearly three years earlier, shortly before His departure from Baghdad, but had never before
been challenged to respond. Since the Báb had indicated in the Bayán that, upon the appearance of
"Him Whom God shall make manifest," the Bábí dispensation would end, Bahá’u’lláh’s claim, if accepted,
meant the end of the dispensation and of Mírzá Yahyá’s authority. Spurred on by Siyyid Muhammad
Isfahání, Mírzá Yahyá refused to accept Bahá’u’lláh’s announcement and countered it with claims of his
own.

                                                         Mírzá Yahyá’s action caused Bahá’u’lláh once again to withdraw
                                                         into isolation. After sending Mírzá Yahyá half of His possessions,
                                                         including rings, seals, and manuscripts that He had received
                                                         from the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh moved to another house and went into
                                                         seclusion on 10 March 1866. For two months no one but His
                                                         immediate family had access to Him. Forced to choose between
                                                         Bahá’u’lláh and Mírzá Yahyá, the community of exiles fell into
                                                         disarray.

                                       Mírzá Yahyá and Siyyid Muhammad Isfahání renewed their
by noted Bahá’í teachers Martha Root and Marion
                                       assault on Bahá’u’lláh by spreading stories to discredit Him.
Jack. Root described this scene as 'a portion of the

the famous Sultan Salim mosque, was Bahá’u’lláh's
                                       Yahyá’s reputation as well. A key miscalculation occurred in
residence at the time of the final break between Him
and Mírzá Yahyá. On 10 Mar. 1866 Bahá’u’lláh

                                       Bahá’u’lláh would decline. Instead, He agreed. A large crowd
gathered for the event, but Mírzá Yahyá, who had been touted as the one seeking to prove the truth of
his position and the falsehood of Bahá’u’lláh’s, failed to appear.

In the summer of 1868, after Mírzá Yahyá had written to the Ottoman authorities and involved them,
the sultan decided to put a stop to the disruption. He ordered Bahá’u’lláh to be incarcerated for life in
the prison city of Acre in Ottoman Palestine (See: Bahá’í World Center.Early Development) and
condemned Mírzá Yahyá to exile on the island of Cyprus.

The upheaval that began in Edirne quickly spread to Iran. In the end,
however, almost all of the Bábís chose to follow Bahá’u’lláh.

In Cyprus, 1868–1912
Mírzá Yahyá was sent to Famagusta, a port city on the northeastern
coast of Cyprus. He remained a recluse, regarded by the inhabitants as
a Muslim holy man, a notion that Mírzá Yahyá did not dispel. When
people called to greet him on important feast days during Ramadan and
the annual period of pilgrimage to Mecca (the Hajj), it being customary
to visit a holy man on such occasions, he accepted their demonstrations
of deference. He and his followers made no attempt to teach the local
people the Bábí or Azalí religious beliefs.

After a few years, three of Mírzá Yahyá’s supporters, Persians from
Zanjan, joined him on the island. Although freed from his exile in 1881,
after the British occupation of Cyprus, Mírzá Yahyá chose to remain in
                                                                                            Mírzá Yahyá, c. 1868. Bahá’í Photographic

Over a two-week period in March 1890, Mírzá Yahyá met with the young Cambridge University
orientalist Edward G. Browne, who found him initially reticent but soon gained his confidence. Browne
described Mírzá Yahyá as "a venerable and benevolent-looking old man of about sixty years of age,
somewhat below the middle height, with ample forehead on which the traces of care and anxiety were
apparent, clear searching blue eyes, and long grey beard" and with a "mild and dignified countenance." 7
From him Browne gained what he considered to be a wealth of new information on the Bábí Faith,
about which Mírzá Yahyá spoke freely, but little about the breach between him and Bahá’u’lláh, which
Mírzá Yahyá was evidently reluctant to discuss.

Mírzá Yahyá died on 29 April 1912 at the age of about eighty. According to an account by his son
Ridván ‘Alí, who had by this time become a Christian and taken the name Constantine the Persian, no
"witnesses to the Bayán" (i.e., Bábís) could be found to carry out the funeral ceremony. Hence, it was
performed by the imám-jum’ih (the chief mullá) of Famagusta and other Muslim clerics. 8 Mírzá Yahyá
was buried in a small shrine that then lay outside the town but is now incorporated in the modern city
of Famagusta.

References to Mírzá Yahyá in Bahá’í Literature
In one of His works, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, Bahá’u’lláh often mentions Mírzá Yahyá and
recounts his actions. Bahá’u’lláh specifically addresses Mírzá Yahyá in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas   (Most Holy
Book): "I swear by God that I have wept for thee to see thee following thy selfish passions. . . .
Granted that the people were confused about thy station, is it conceivable that thou thyself art similarly
confused?" In the same passage, Bahá’u’lláh urges Mírzá Yahyá to repent of his wrongdoing and
assures him of God’s forgiveness if he repents.9 In His Suriy-i-Haykal, Bahá’u’lláh speaks of having
"singled out" Mírzá Yahyá and "protected him from the harm of the malevolent," only to find that "he
became filled with arrogance and pride" and "emerged from behind the veil of concealment" to plot
against Bahá’u’lláh. "Were God to turn all the oceans of the earth into ink and all created things into
pens," Bahá’u’lláh continues, "they would not suffice Me to exhaust the record of his wrongdoings."10

According to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Bahá’u’lláh’s brother Mírzá Músá sought to "rescue Mírzá Yahyá from the
gulf" during the Adrianople period, reminding him of Bahá’u’lláh’s kindness and His efforts to train them
both, assisting with spelling and composition and even guiding Mírzá Yahyá’s hand with His own. "Is
this your thanks for all His tenderness," Mírzá Musá reportedly asked, "that you plot with Siyyid
Muhammad and desert the shelter of Bahá’u’lláh?"11

Shoghi Effendi refers frequently to Mírzá Yahyá in his history of the Bábí and Bahá’í Faiths from 1844 to
1944, including devoting a chapter to "The Rebellion of Mírzá Yahyá and the Proclamation of
Bahá’u’lláh’s Mission in Adrianople." 12

In many of His writings, particularly in the Kitáb-i Badí’, Bahá’u’lláh addresses the Azalís, those who
followed Mírzá Yahyá. Bahá’u’lláh usually refers to them as the "People of the Bayán" and exhorts them
to examine His claims fairly and in the light of the writings of the Báb.

EDWARD G. BROWNE AND THE QUESTION OF THE SUCCESSION TO THE BÁB
Edward G. Browne, whose study of the Bábís played a major role in bringing the Bábí and Bahá’í Faiths
to the attention of Western academics, has made the question of Mírzá Yahyá’s accession to the
leadership of the Bábí movement seem simple and logical by asserting that Mírzá Yahyá was one of the
Letters of the Living, the fourth letter of the first váhid (or unit of nineteen) of the Bábí hierarchy.13
Thus, Browne concludes, Mírzá Yahyá became the leader after the three persons above him—the Báb,
Quddús, and Mullá Husayn Bushrú’í—had been killed.

This explanation is fundamentally flawed, however. Mírzá Yahyá was not a Letter of the Living. He was
only thirteen years old in 1844, when the Báb’s first disciples sought and recognized Him. According to
Mírzá Yahyá’s own statements, he did not become a Bábí until some time later. Moreover, neither the
proto-Azalí history Nuqtatu’l-Káf nor the Azalí polemical work Hasht Bihisht makes such a claim for
Mírzá Yahyá. The twentieth-century Azalí polemicist and descendant of Mírzá Yahyá, Jalal Azal, also
asserts that Mírzá Yahyá "was not a Letter of the Living." 14

Browne has claimed, moreover, that "during the period which elapsed from the Báb’s death till the
advancement of Behá’u’lláh’s claim to be ‘He whom God shall manifest’ (i.e. from 1850 to 1864 at any
rate) he [Azal] was recognized by all the Bábís as their spiritual chief."15 Such a position is untenable
even on the basis of statements that the Azalís themselves advance. The Hasht Bihisht, written by two
sons-in-law of Mírzá Yahyá-Shaykh Ahmad Ruhí and Mírzá Áqá Khán Kirmání—and quoted by Browne,
lists five persons who in this same period laid claim to the station of "Him Whom God shall make
manifest" and thereby implied the abrogation Mírzá Yahyá’s authority.16 Moreover, since one of the five,
Husayn Mílání, was killed in the 1852 upheaval, these claims must have originated shortly after the
martyrdom of the Báb. Furthermore, Mírzá Yahyá makes it clear in his book Mustayqiz (quoted by
Browne) that at least one of these claimants, Mírzá Asadu’lláh Dayyán, had attracted a following from
among the Bábís; Mírzá Yahyá calls them the Asadíyyún.17 Browne also mentions Husayn Mílání and
Siyyid Husayn of Hindíján (in the vicinity of Fárs) as having attracted a following.18

                                  Thus, even from information well known to Browne, Mírzá Yahyá’s
                                  authority was clearly far from paramount or unchallenged as early as
                                  the period shortly after the Báb’s martyrdom. It was certainly not the
                                  case, as Browne often suggests, that Bahá’u’lláh introduced His claim
                                  into the midst of a movement solidly united behind Mírzá Yahyá.

                                        A third area in which Browne has been responsible for perpetuating a
                                        misleading impression is the question of the timing of the advent of
                                        "Him Whom God shall make manifest." Browne has advanced the late
                                        Azalí position that maintains from the numerology of the words Ghiyáth
                                        (Succorer) and Mustagháth (He who is invoked for succor) that "He
                                        Whom God shall make manifest" would not appear before fifteen
                                        hundred or two thousand years had passed. However, the Bábís in the
                                        1850s expected an imminent advent. Quite apart from oral statements
                                        that the Báb reportedly made, indicating to several of His disciples that
                                        they would meet "Him Whom God shall make manifest," a number of

Community. Bahá’í Media Bank            the early period had been expecting the advent of "Him Whom God
shall make manifest" in fifteen hundred years or more, it is unlikely that so many claimants would have
emerged in the decade and a half immediately after the Báb’s martyrdom.

Finally, the early pro-Azalí work Nuqtatu’l-Káf identifies Mírzá Yahyá as "He Whom God shall make
manifest. "19 Thus the claim that Man Yuzhiruhu’lláh would not appear before fifteen hundred years is a
late Azalí position taken in response to Bahá’u’lláh’s claim; it probably originated with the authors of the
Hasht Bihisht.

THE AZALÍS

In Iran
The vast majority of the Bábís of Iran became Bahá’ís. Among the small pockets of Bábís who did not,
a very few stayed uncommitted to either Bahá’u’lláh or Mírzá Yahyá and are called Bayání Bábís. A
larger number looked to Mírzá Yahyá as their leader and are called Azalí Bábís.

At first, appreciable numbers of Azalís existed in Iran, usually revolving around one or more prominent
individuals: in Qazvin, around Muhammad Hasan Fatá and Mullá Hádí Qazvíní; in the Kashan and Naráq
area, around Mullá Ja’far Naráqí; in the Isfahan area, around Mullá Rajab ‘Alí Qahír (whose sister had
married the Báb while He was in Isfahan), his brother Mullá ‘Alí-Muhammad Siráj, and Mírzá Hádí
Dawlatábádí; in Kirman, around Mullá Muhammad Ja’far Kirmání; and in Núr, around Mírzá Yahyá’s half-
sister and other members of his family. Azalí groups could also be found in some of the towns and
villages of Azerbaijan, in Hindíján, and in Zanjan.

Over the years, however, the Azalí groups in Iran diminished. In many towns, meetings were held to
debate the claims of Bahá’u’lláh and Mírzá Yahyá. Some individual Azalís made the journey to Cyprus
and Acre to investigate the claims of Mírzá Yahyá and Bahá’u’lláh. They usually returned as Bahá’ís.
One such was Áqá Mírzá Yahyá Sarráf, the son of the Qazvin Azalí leader Muhammad Hasan Fatá. His
conversion to the Bahá’í cause, followed by the conversion of other Azalís, led to the eventual
disappearance of the Qazvin Azalí group. The Hindíján Azalís also disappeared, most of them reverting
to Islam.

Up to the time of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, estimates of the numbers of Azalís in Iran ranged from
five hundred to five thousand. They could be divided into two categories. One group, many of whom
should be regarded more as Bábís than Azalís, were villagers in such places as Tár, near Kashan, and
several villages near Isfahan.

The other group of Azalís was deeply involved in politics. Although their numbers were small, they
played an important role in the reform and constitutionalist movements in Iran. Mírzá Yahyá’s two sons-
in-law, Shaykh Ahmad Rúhí (the son of the Azálí leader Mullá Muhammad Ja’far Kirmání, mentioned
above) and Mírzá Áqá Khán Kirmání, were both important writers who promoted the cause of reform in
Iran in the late nineteenth century and advanced the pan-Islamist movement of Siyyid Jamal al-Din
Asadabadi ("Afghani"). They were both executed in Tabriz in 1896, after the assassination of Nasir al-
Din Shah by one of Siyyid Jamal al-Dín’s supporters. Mírzá Nasru’lláh Maliku’l-Mutakallimín and Siyyid
Jamalu’d-Dín Isfahání were Azalís from Isfahan who played important roles as populist preachers in the
Constitutional Revolution of 1906.

The group of Azalís interested in politics centered on the Dawlatábádí family. In later years members of
this group helped one another into high places in the political and governmental establishment in
Pahlavi Iran. They also included a number of literary figures, such as Mutarjim Humáyún. They had no
organization and held no meetings, but, from about 1942 onward, one of their number named Qásimí
published a few books, including some works by the Báb.

In Cyprus
The Azalís remaining in Cyprus are mostly the descendants of Mírzá Yahyá, who had numerous wives
(estimates of the number vary from eleven, given by his own son, to seventeen). The marriages
resulted in a large number of children, many of whom resided in Cyprus.

Several of Mírzá Yahyá’s children defected from the Azalí cause. His eldest son in Cyprus, Ahmad
Bahháj, became a Bahá’í; another son became a Christian. Many of his children either did not marry or
were childless. Therefore, the numbers of his acknowledged descendants shrank in the succeeding
generations. Most of Mírzá Yahyá’s descendants in Cyprus at present are outwardly Muslims, and no
Azalí community as such exists.

Succession
It appears that Mírzá Yahyá originally intended his son Ahmad Bahháj to succeed him. After a family
dispute, Mírzá Yahyá changed the succession and appointed Mírzá Hádí Dawlatábádí. On Mírzá Hádí’s
death in 1908, Mírzá Yahyá appointed Mírzá Yahyá Dawlatábádí, Mírzá Hádí’s son, who resided in Tehran
and became a member of Parliament and a prominent figure in Iranian public life.
The E. G. Browne manuscripts include a poem that appears to indicate that the succession should have
gone to Mírzá Yahyá’s grandson Hájí Mírzá Ahmad Misbahu’l-Hukamá, the son of Núru’lláh. 20 However,
Jalál Azal, a grandson of Mírzá Yahyá and a latter-day Azalí apologist, denies that Mírzá Yahyá
appointed anyone to succeed him. At present, the Azalís appear to have no leader.
