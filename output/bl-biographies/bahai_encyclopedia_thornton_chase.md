Chase, Thornton (1847–1912)
First person in the West to become a steadfast Bahá’í; one of the founders and
chief builders of the Chicago Bahá’í community; included by Shoghi Effendi among
a number of prominent early Bahá’ís of the West whom he designated as
"Disciples of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá."

mother eighteen days after he was born
profoundly shaped his subsequent development. Jotham remarried three years later, and the couple
soon adopted three girls, but Chase and his stepmother seem not to have bonded. Chase described his
childhood as "loveless and lonely," with "neither mother, sister nor brother."1 The inner vacuum he felt
apparently set him on a quest for love that culminated in his mystical interests.

for one month’s training in a school for officers of
black infantry units. By May, Chase was second in command of one hundred men, Company K of the
Twenty-sixth United States Colored Troops. Two months later, on 5 and 7 July, the unit fought two
battles in South Carolina, south of Charleston; Chase was slightly wounded by an exploding cannon,
which permanently impaired the hearing in his left ear. By the end of the war in April 1865, he had
been promoted to captain and headed his own company.

YEARS OF SPIRITUAL SEARCH
After the war Chase attended Brown University but dropped out before completing his second semester.
He returned to Springfield, where he worked as a salesman for his father’s timber business, and on 11
May 1870 he married Annie Elizabeth Allyn of Bristol, Rhode Island. The couple had two children: Sarah
Thornton (1871) and Jessamine Allyn (1874). Chase started his own specialty lumber business in
Springfield, directed the choir of the First Baptist Church, and served as an officer in one of the city’s
musical organizations.

In 1872 Chase’s business failed. Unable to obtain work in Springfield, Chase moved to Boston, where he
obtained a meager living through singing and acting. In 1873, in the midst of loneliness, poverty, and a
sense of failure, Chase had an experience of God’s love, of love "unspeakable," of "absolute oneness." 2
The experience pulled him back from the brink of self-destruction, renewed his hope, and gave further

impetus to his religious search.

When employment opportunities in Boston proved inadequate, Chase moved to Fort Howard (Green
Bay), Wisconsin, where he taught school for a time. Then he moved to Chicago, where he acted in
McVicker’s Theater, one of the better-known theaters in the city. He subsequently obtained teaching
and music jobs in Kansas and lived for a time in Del Norte, Colorado.

While Chase searched for meaningful work, Annie and the two children remained in Springfield with her
mother, waiting for him to settle and support his family. Finally, in the mid-1870s, she moved back to
Rhode Island and in March 1878 sued Chase for divorce. He begged her to reconsider, but the court
granted her petition. She remained in Newport, Rhode Island, where she died in 1918. Chase’s older
daughter, Sarah, married in 1895 and had five children before dying suddenly in 1908. Chase’s second
daughter, Jessamine, who never married, became a schoolteacher and musician, like her father. She
died in 1947.

search and began to read a wide variety of books about religion.

Chase continued to earn his living in various ways, as a journalist, an actor in Denver, and an operator
of a music store. In 1888 he was hired by the Union Mutual Life Insurance Company as an agent and
soon became the manager of its entire Colorado operation. In 1889 the company promoted him and
moved him to its Santa Cruz and San Francisco offices. Chase’s only son, William Jotham Thornton
Chase, was born in Santa Cruz on 28 June 1889 (d. 2 March 1967).

In California, Thornton Chase continued his religious search, combining it with his work. In 1893 he
published a booklet called Sketches that uses biblical and religious stories to explain why people should
purchase life insurance for themselves. The booklet reveals Chase as a religious seeker familiar with all
the major religions.

ACTIVITIES AS A BAHÁ’Í
About 1893 Union Mutual transferred Chase to Chicago, the headquarters for all company operations
west of the Appalachian Mountains. In early 1894 Chase was writing a poem about God when a

business colleague entered his office. The colleague was intrigued by the poem and told Chase about a
man who claimed that God had recently "walked upon the earth." 3 Chase investigated and discovered
that the man was Ibrahim Kheiralla, a Bahá’í from Beirut who had recently come to the United States,
and that he taught the coming of Bahá’u’lláh, a Messenger of God, in fulfillment of biblical prophecy.
Chase and a small group of Chicagoans began to study the Bahá’í Faith with Kheiralla. Chase indicates
that 5 June 1894 was a crucial date for the class; probably it was the day the class was organized. By
1895 Chase had completed the class and had become a Bahá’í. At least three other Americans
completed the class and accepted the new religion before Chase, but subsequently these three lost
interest in the Bahá’í Faith. Thus, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá recognized Chase as "the first American believer," 4 and
Shoghi Effendi later described him as "indeed the first to embrace the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh in the
Western world." 5

Classes on the Bahá’í Faith were organized in Chicago and later in Enterprise, Kansas; Kenosha,
Wisconsin; Ithaca, New York; New York City; Philadelphia; and Oakland, California. By 1899 about
fifteen hundred Americans had become Bahá’ís, including seven hundred in Chicago. Chase gave a class
on the Bahá’í Faith, wrote numerous letters to interested seekers, and taught the Faith widely during
his frequent travels for his company.

In 1899 American Bahá’ís returning from a pilgrimage to the
Bahá’í holy places in Ottoman Palestine (See: Bahá’í World
Center) brought to North America rudimentary knowledge of the
Bahá’í administrative system (See: Administration, Bahá’í).
Chase became actively involved in administering the Chicago
Bahá’í community, first in November 1899, when the community
elected officers, and then in March 1900, when the community
elected a ten-member Board of Council. Chase was one of the
1899 officers and a member of the 1900 board. Starting in
1898, Ibrahim Kheiralla began to insist on a formal role as
leader of the American Bahá’ís. Chase was one of those who
tried unsuccessfully to help Kheiralla realize the
inappropriateness of his demand, and subsequently Chase
played a central part in reorganizing the Bahá’í community
independently of Kheiralla.

In 1900 and 1901 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent four knowledgeable Persians
—‘Abdu’l Karím Tihrání, Hájí Mírzá Hasan Khurásání, Mírzá
Asadu’lláh Isfahání, and Mírzá Abu’l-Fadl Gulpáygání—to the         Thornton Chase. National Bahá’í Archives, United

States.

United States to deepen the Bahá’ís’ knowledge of their religion.
Chase arranged for the latter two visitors to stay in the Chicago Bahá’í Center and moved into the
center with them when his wife had to go to New England for a year to handle legal matters connected
with the death of his stepmother in Springfield.

Having acquired a deep understanding of the Bahá’í teachings during his time with the Persians, Chase
soon emerged as the principal organizer of the Chicago Bahá’í community. In May 1901 he coordinated
an election that replaced the Board of Council with a new consultative body, which was first called the
Chicago House of Justice and then the Chicago House of Spirituality. By 1902 Chase was serving as
chairman of the House of Spirituality, an office he retained until he moved to California in 1909. Chase
had learned about the Bahá’í principle of consultation from the Persian teachers and emphasized its
importance, thus becoming the first American Bahá’í to champion it. Chase also wrote many circular
letters that the House of Spirituality sent to Bahá’í communities throughout the United States and
Canada, explaining the Bahá’í holy days and the period of fasting, thereby establishing their observance
in North America.

Chase’s writing experience proved useful in the effort to edit and publish Bahá’í literature. In 1900

Chase and three other Chicago Bahá’í businessmen founded the Behais Supply and Publishing Board of
Chicago. In the fall of 1902, the publisher was legally incorporated as the Bahai Publishing Society. It
soon emerged as the principal publisher of Bahá’í literature in the English-speaking world and became a
major force behind the standardization of the spelling of Persian and Arabic Bahá’í names and terms.
Chase was the principal editor of the society’s literature and one of its principal financiers. The society
published several Bahá’í pamphlets that Chase wrote.

In 1907 Chase was able to go on pilgrimage to Ottoman Palestine. Though he could be with ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá in Acre for only three days, the experience transformed Chase. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, highly impressed by
Chase’s qualities, conferred on him the title Thábit (Steadfast).

On returning home Chase wrote an account of his pilgrimage that was published in 1908 as In Galilee.
The short work gives a detailed and poignant description of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s home and family in Acre, as
well as a moving description of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself. The work remains an important example of the
genre commonly known as pilgrim’s notes; thoughtful and reflective, it is of higher quality than most.

opportunities to serve his religion. Chase considered resigning
National Bahá’í Archives, United States.    from the company, but at the age of sixty-two he found it

impossible to obtain another job, and he had to support his wife,
his son in college, and his elderly mother-in-law, none of whom had become Bahá’í. Consequently,
Chase had no choice but to accept the new position, even though it paid much less than he had been
earning.

Chase still traveled extensively for his company as far north as Seattle and as far east as Denver,
travels that gave him opportunities to visit the rapidly developing Bahá’í communities of the Rocky
Mountain and Pacific states. At home he helped to organize the Los Angeles Bahá’ís. In 1910 they
elected Chase a member of their first five-member governing board and established their first monthly
meetings. During this period Chase returned to writing poetry, primarily on the Bahá’í Faith.

Thornton Chase became ill, suddenly and unexpectedly, while traveling in late September 1912.
Following abdominal surgery, he lay gravely ill in a Los Angeles hospital. On 27 September the Bahá’ís
wired the news to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who was visiting the United States at the time and had stopped briefly
to rest in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, en route to San Francisco. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and His party were
saddened by the news. Chase died on the evening of 30 September, just a day before ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
arrived in California, and was buried on 4 October in Inglewood Park Cemetery. Bahá’ís throughout the
United States sent messages eulogizing Chase for his intelligence, his consultative approach to
problems, his constant advocacy of the need for organization, and his loving disposition.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá made a special trip to Los Angeles to visit Chase’s grave. On 19 October, accompanied by
about twenty-five Bahá’ís, He took a tram to the cemetery, walked solemnly and directly to the
gravesite, and carefully covered it with flowers. He then chanted Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet of Visitation, which

is recited in the Shrines of Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb, and a prayer for the departed. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
reportedly praised Chase’s qualities: "During his lifetime he bore many trials and vicissitudes, but he
was very patient and long-suffering. He had a heart most illuminated, a spirit most rejoiced; his hope
was to serve the world of humanity. . . ." ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated that Chase "will not be forgotten" and
that his worth was not known then but would become "inestimably dear." ‘Abdu’l-Bahá instructed the
Bahá’ís to visit Chase’s grave, to bring flowers on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s behalf, and to "have the utmost
consideration for the members of his family." 6 At the end of His visit, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá knelt and kissed the
grave.

Shoghi Effendi, in God Passes By , his history of the first Bahá’í
century, mentions the "poignant sight" of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá kissing
the tombstone of "His beloved disciple" as one of the scenes
from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to the West that will never "be effaced
from memory."7 Shoghi Effendi also included Chase among
outstanding early Bahá’í’s of the West whom he designated as
"Disciples of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá." 8

Adhering to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s instructions, the American Bahá’í
community holds an annual commemoration at Chase’s grave on
the Sunday nearest to the date of his death. His importance as
an early North American Bahá’í thinker, publicist, administrator,
and organizer is still underappreciated, however. In many ways
Chase’s death left a gap in the North American Bahá’í
community that remained unfilled until the rise to prominence in
the early 1920s of Horace Holley, the chief developer of Bahá’í
organization in the United States and Canada.
