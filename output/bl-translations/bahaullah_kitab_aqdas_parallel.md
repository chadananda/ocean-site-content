## The Most Holy Book: Parallel Translation of the _Kitáb-i-Aqdas_

### by [Bahá'u'lláh](https://bahai-library.com/author/Bahá'u'lláh)

translated by [Shoghi Effendi](https://bahai-library.com/author/Shoghi%20Effendi) and [Anton Haddad](https://bahai-library.com/author/Anton%20Haddad).  
1901/1922


> **About:** This parallel text of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas presents the Authorized Translation by Shoghi Effendi et al. (ca. 1950-1992) and the first English translation by Anton Haddad (ca. 1901). The paragraph breaks in these two texts usually do not coincide. Like most Arabic writings, the original Aqdas was revealed without this segmentation—paragraph breaks were supplied by the translators. For paralleling purposes, it was necessary to include section breaks in this version. The sections were split according to the Authorized translation, with three verses per section. Where this splits the Haddad translation in the middle of a paragraph, the annotation "\[no break\]" is inserted. The Haddad translation also lacks the verse numbers inserted in the Authorized edition. Footnotes to the Haddad translation are in the body of the text in the original. Short parenthetical comments are left there; longer ones have been moved to the end of the table cell, and are indicated by smaller font. The Haddad translation may contain typographical errors or omissions, introduced either through its long history of manuscript transmission or by being hand-entered for this online edition. \[-J.W., 1999\]

| IN THE NAME OF HIM WHO IS THE SUPREME RULER OVER ALL THAT HATH BEEN AND ALL THAT IS TO BE

#### 1

The first duty prescribed by God for His servants is the recognition of Him Who is the Dayspring of His Revelation and the Fountain of His laws, Who representeth the Godhead in both the Kingdom of His Cause and the world of creation. Whoso achieveth this duty hath attained unto all good; and whoso is deprived thereof hath gone astray, though he be the author of every righteous deed. It behoveth every one who reacheth this most sublime station, this summit of transcendent glory, to observe every ordinance of Him Who is the Desire of the world. These twin duties are inseparable. Neither is acceptable without the other. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the Source of Divine inspiration.

#### 2

They whom God hath endued with insight will readily recognize that the precepts laid down by God constitute the highest means for the maintenance of order in the world and the security of its peoples. He that turneth away from them is accounted among the abject and foolish. We, verily, have commanded you to refuse the dictates of your evil passions and corrupt desires, and not to transgress the bounds which the Pen of the Most High hath fixed, for these are the breath of life unto all created things. The seas of Divine wisdom and Divine utterance have risen under the breath of the breeze of the All-Merciful. Hasten to drink your fill, O men of understanding! They that have violated the Covenant of God by breaking His commandments, and have turned back on their heels, these have erred grievously in the sight of God, the All- Possessing, the Most High.

#### 3

O ye peoples of the world! Know assuredly that My commandments are the lamps of My loving providence among My servants, and the keys of My mercy for My creatures. Thus hath it been sent down from the heaven of the Will of your Lord, the Lord of Revelation. Were any man to taste the sweetness of the words which the lips of the All-Merciful have willed to utter, he would, though the treasures of the earth be in his possession, renounce them one and all, that he might vindicate the truth of even one of His commandments, shining above the Dayspring of His bountiful care and loving-kindness. | IN HIS NAME, THE RULER OVER WHAT WAS AND IS.

Verily the first thing which God hath ordained unto the servants is the knowledge of the dawning place of His command, which was the station of Himself, in the world of command and creation (that is, the knowledge of Bahá, who is the manifestation of God in the world).

Whosoever attaineth there unto hath attained unto all good; and he who is deprived thereof is indeed of the people of error - even though he bringeth all good actions.

And when this most glorious station and this most lofty horizon hath been attained, it behooveth every one to follow that whereunto he is commanded on the part of the supreme object, because these two things are inseparable: one of them will not be accepted without the other. This is what the dayspring of inspiration hath decreed. Verily those who are given vision from God will regard. the ordinances of God as the greatest means to the order of the world and the preservation of the nations - and those who are careless, are of the vile and worthless.

Verily we have commanded you to restrain the desires of passion and lust, and not violate that which was written by the supreme pen; for it is indeed the spirit of life to whomsoever is in the realm of creation - The seas of wisdom (inspired utterances) and beyan have moved, because the breath of the merciful hath breathed.

Avail yourselves of this (opportunity) Oh people of intelligence! Verily those who have violated the covenant of God in His commandments, and turned backwards, (become backsliders) are of the people of error before God the independent, the exalted. O people of the earth! Know that My commandments are assuredly the lamps of My grace amongst My servants, and the keys of My mercy for the creatures.

Thus hath the matter been revealed from the heaven of the primal will of your Lord, the ruler of all religions.

Should any one come in contact with the delight of beyan - which has come from the mouth of the will of the merciful - he would expend all that possesseth even should it be all the treasures of the earth for the sake of establishing one command of His commandments, that shine from the horizon of grace and goodness.

Say: From My laws the sweet-smelling savour of My garment can be smelled, and by their aid the standards of Victory will be planted upon the highest peaks. The Tongue of My power hath, from the heaven of My omnipotent glory, addressed to My creation these words: "Observe My commandments, for the love of My beauty." Happy is the lover that hath inhaled the divine fragrance of his Best-Beloved from these words, laden with the perfume of a grace which no tongue can describe. By My life! He who hath drunk the choice wine of fairness from the hands of My bountiful favour will circle around My commandments that shine above the Dayspring of My creation.

#### 5

Think not that We have revealed unto you a mere code of laws. Nay, rather, We have unsealed the choice Wine with the fingers of might and power. To this beareth witness that which the Pen of Revelation hath revealed. Meditate upon this, O men of insight!

#### 6

We have enjoined obligatory prayer upon you, with nine rak'ahs, to be offered at noon and in the morning and the evening unto God, the Revealer of Verses. We have relieved you of a greater number, as a command in the Book of God. He, verily, is the Ordainer, the Omnipotent, the Unrestrained. When ye desire to perform this prayer, turn ye towards the Court of My Most Holy Presence, this Hallowed Spot that God hath made the Centre round which circle the Concourse on High, and which He hath decreed to be the Point of Adoration for the denizens of the Cities of Eternity, and the Source of Command unto all that are in heaven and on earth; and when the Sun of Truth and Utterance shall set, turn your faces towards the Spot that We have ordained for you. He, verily, is Almighty and Omniscient. | \[no break\] Say! From My ordinances emanateth the scent of My garment, and by them the standards of victory will be hoisted on the tops of mountains and hills. The tongue of My might, in the realm of My greatness hath addressed My creatures saying: "Follow My ordinances for the love of My perfection. Blessed is a lover who findeth the scent of the beloved from this word wherefrom emanateth the fragrances of grace, in such wise that to describe them is beyond the power of mind.

By My life, he who drinketh the pure wine of fairness from the hands of favors is indeed revolving around My commandments that shine from the horizon of creation.  
  
Think ye not that we have revealed the ordinances unto you; rather we have opened the seal of the sealed wine, with the fingers of might and potency, whereunto will bear witness that which was revealed by the pen of inspiration. Reflect on this - O people of ideas! In prayer, nine prostrations are ordained before God, the revealer of the signs:- the morning, the afternoon and the evening, and we have exempted you from sundry others as commanded in the book of God (Koran). Verily, He is the commander, the potent, the unconstrained.  
  
When you want to pray, turn your faces towards the most holy region, (The Holy Place) which God hath made the point round which the supreme concourse revolves, and that whereunto the denizens of the cities of permanence advance; and that whence issueth the command to whomsoever is on the earth and in the heavens. And when the sun of truth and exaltation sets, the Kibla will be that place which we have appointed unto you. Verily, He is the mighty, the all- knowing!

#### 7

Everything that is hath come to be through His irresistible decree. Whenever My laws appear like the sun in the heaven of Mine utterance, they must be faithfully obeyed by all, though My decree be such as to cause the heaven of every religion to be cleft asunder. He doeth what He pleaseth. He chooseth, and none may question His choice. Whatsoever He, the Well-Beloved, ordaineth, the same is, verily, beloved. To this He Who is the Lord of all creation beareth Me witness. Whoso hath inhaled the sweet fragrance of the All-Merciful, and recognized the Source of this utterance, will welcome with his own eyes the shafts of the enemy, that he may establish the truth of the laws of God amongst men. Well is it with him that hath turned thereunto, and apprehended the meaning of His decisive decree.

#### 8

We have set forth the details of obligatory prayer in another Tablet. Blessed is he who observeth that whereunto he hath been bidden by Him Who ruleth over all mankind. In the Prayer for the Dead six specific passages have been sent down by God, the Revealer of Verses. Let one who is able to read recite that which hath been revealed to precede these passages; and as for him who is unable, God hath relieved him of this requirement. He, of a truth, is the Mighty, the Pardoner.

#### 9

Hair doth not invalidate your prayer, nor aught from which the spirit hath departed, such as bones and the like. Ye are free to wear the fur of the sable as ye would that of the beaver, the squirrel, and other animals; the prohibition of its use hath stemmed, not from the Qur'an, but from the misconceptions of the divines. He, verily, is the All-Glorious, the All-Knowing. | \[no break\] Everything has been established by His decisive command, and when the sun of the ordinances shineth from the horizon of El Beyan it then will be the duty of everyone to follow him, should it be in such a manner that causes the heavens of the hearts of all religions to be rent. Verily He doeth what He pleaseth, and will not be questioned of that which He desireth, and whatever is decreed by the beloved, by the life of the ruler of creation! is indeed beloved. Verily he who findeth the scent of the merciful and knoweth the dayspring of this Beyan, verily he will turn to receive in his heart the darts of affliction for the purpose of establishing the ordinances amidst the creatures.

Blessed is he who advanceth, and attaineth unto the perfections of the incontrovertible proof (This Book). We have fully expounded the laws of prayer in another paper (tablet). Blessed is he who doeth that whereunto he is commanded on the part of God, the ruler of persons.

Prayer used for the burial of the dead as given by God, the revealer of signs, is six taxbeerat; - that is, to say the word, "Allah'ho'Akbar", (God is greater) six times; but he who knows how to read, must repeat over the revealed lines preceding the foregoing word - and he who does not, is excused. Verily He is the mighty, the pardoner! Hair, or that which is void of life, such as bone, would not nullify your prayers. Attire yourselves with the fur of sable in the same manner as ye use silkware and the fur of minever and aught else. Verily it was not forbidden in the Koran, but was misunderstood by the divines. He is the potent, the omniscient.*****

***** (This refers to the Shiites who believe that the wearing of garments containing the hair of animals, or which are made of their skins, or have buttons of bone or ivory would be conducive to the nullification of their prayers; believing that the same was prohibited in the Koran.)

#### 10

We have commanded you to pray and fast from the beginning of maturity; this is ordained by God, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers. He hath exempted from this those who are weak from illness or age, as a bounty from His Presence, and He is the Forgiving, the Generous. God hath granted you leave to prostrate yourselves on any surface that is clean, for We have removed in this regard the limitation that had been laid down in the Book; God, indeed, hath knowledge of that whereof ye know naught. Let him that findeth no water for ablution repeat five times the words "In the Name of God, the Most Pure, the Most Pure", and then proceed to his devotions. Such is the command of the Lord of all worlds. In regions where the days and nights grow long, let times of prayer be gauged by clocks and other instruments that mark the passage of the hours. He, verily, is the Expounder, the Wise.

#### 11

We have absolved you from the requirement of performing the Prayer of the Signs. On the appearance of fearful natural events call ye to mind the might and majesty of your Lord, He Who heareth and seeth all, and say "Dominion is God's, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, the Lord of creation".

#### 12

It hath been ordained that obligatory prayer is to be performed by each of you individually. Save in the Prayer for the Dead, the practice of congregational prayer hath been annulled. He, of a truth, is the Ordainer, the All-Wise. | Prayer and fasting are incumbent upon you after maturity - as a command on the part of your Lord, and the Lord of your forefathers. The sick, the aged and the infirm are excused, as a favor on His part. Verily He is the pardoner, the bounteous!

God hath permitted you to worship upon any clean thing, and the law concerning this as ordained in the book (Koran) is hereby cancelled. Verily, God knoweth, but ye know not!  
  
He who doth not find water it sufficeth him to say, five times, the words: - "Bismullah Al Attar Al Athas". (In the name of God, the most pure). Then let him begin to pray - this is what hath been decreed by the Lord of the worlds.  
  
In the countries wherein days and nights are long, times of prayers must be regulated by watches and time pieces, by means of which time is limited. Verily He is the listener, the seer! Then say:- Greatness be to God, the Lord of the visible and the invisible, and the Lord of the worlds! (This refers to the Mohammedan custom of reciting certain prayers individually, \[sic — no closing parenthesis\] and all congregational prayers are abolished, except in the single case of the prayers used for the burial of the dead - Verily He is the powerful, the wise!

#### 13

God hath exempted women who are in their courses from obligatory prayer and fasting. Let them, instead, after performance of their ablutions, give praise unto God, repeating ninety-five times between the noon of one day and the next "Glorified be God, the Lord of Splendour and Beauty". Thus hath it been decreed in the Book, if ye be of them that comprehend.

#### 14

When travelling, if ye should stop and rest in some safe spot, perform ye- -men and women alike — a single prostration in place of each unsaid Obligatory Prayer, and while prostrating say "Glorified be God, the Lord of Might and Majesty, of Grace and Bounty". Whoso is unable to do this, let him say only "Glorified be God"; this shall assuredly suffice him. He is, of a truth, the all-sufficing, the ever-abiding, the forgiving, compassionate God. Upon completing your prostrations, seat yourselves cross-legged — men and women alike — and eighteen times repeat "Glorified be God, the Lord of the kingdoms of earth and heaven". Thus doth the Lord make plain the ways of truth and guidance, ways that lead to one way, which is this Straight Path. Render thanks unto God for this most gracious favour; offer praise unto Him for this bounty that hath encompassed the heavens and the earth; extol Him for this mercy that hath pervaded all creation.

#### 15

Say: God hath made My hidden love the key to the Treasure; would that ye might perceive it! But for the key, the Treasure would to all eternity have remained concealed; would that ye might believe it! Say: This is the Source of Revelation, the Dawning-place of Splendour, Whose brightness hath illumined the horizons of the world. Would that ye might understand! This is, verily, that fixed Decree through which every irrevocable decree hath been established. | Women, during the period of menstruation are excused by God from praying and fasting, but they have to bathe themselves and praise God ninety-five times from noon to noon, saying:-"Glory be to God, the Lord of Beauty and Perfection." (Subhan Allah Thil-Talat- Weljamel.) Thus hath the matter been decreed in the book, were ye of those who know.

While travelling, it is incumbent upon men and women on arriving at a place of safety for rest, to substitute one prostration for each form of prayer and say "Praise be to God, the owner of greatness, glory, bounty and grace. (Subhan Allah Thil Athamat Walijlall Wal Mowhabat Afthal). And he who cannot manage more, it sufficeth him to say: "Glory be to God" (Subhan Allah). Verily He is the sufficient, the everlasting, the pardoner, the clement!

On the completion of your worship you must sit down on the temple of unity (sit on the floor with the feet under the body) and say "Glory be to God - the possessor of the kingdom and the realm of creation." (Subhan Allah Thil Mullwal Malacoot) Thus hath God expounded unto you the paths of truth and guidance which have eventually terminated in one path, and it is this which is the "Right path". Give thanks to God for this great bounty! Praise God for this gift which encompasseth the heavens and earth! And celebrate the name of God for this mercy which \*proceeded\* the worlds! Say: God hath made His hidden love as a key to the treasure if ye are to know, and were it not for the key, it would remain hidden for eternities of eternities, were ye to believe. Say: This is indeed the dayspring of revelation and the dawning place of effulgence were ye to know!

Verily this is the irreversible decree, whereby every decisive fate is established.

#### 16

O Pen of the Most High! Say: O people of the world! We have enjoined upon you fasting during a brief period, and at its close have designated for you Naw-Ruz as a feast. Thus hath the Day-Star of Utterance shone forth above the horizon of the Book as decreed by Him Who is the Lord of the beginning and the end. Let the days in excess of the months be placed before the month of fasting. We have ordained that these, amid all nights and days, shall be the manifestations of the letter Ha, and thus they have not been bounded by the limits of the year and its months. It behoveth the people of Bahá, throughout these days, to provide good cheer for themselves, their kindred and, beyond them, the poor and needy, and with joy and exultation to hail and glorify their Lord, to sing His praise and magnify His Name; and when they end — these days of giving that precede the season of restraint — let them enter upon the Fast. Thus hath it been ordained by Him Who is the Lord of all mankind. The traveller, the ailing, those who are with child or giving suck, are not bound by the Fast; they have been exempted by God as a token of His grace. He, verily, is the Almighty, the Most Generous.

#### 17

These are the ordinances of God that have been set down in the Books and Tablets by His Most Exalted Pen. Hold ye fast unto His statutes and commandments, and be not of those who, following their idle fancies and vain imaginings, have clung to the standards fixed by their own selves, and cast behind their backs the standards laid down by God. Abstain from food and drink from sunrise to sundown, and beware lest desire deprive you of this grace that is appointed in the Book.

#### 18

It hath been ordained that every believer in God, the Lord of Judgement, shall, each day, having washed his hands and then his face, seat himself and, turning unto God, repeat "Allah-u-Abha" ninety-five times. Such was the decree of the Maker of the Heavens when, with majesty and power, He established Himself upon the thrones of His Names. Perform ye, likewise, ablutions for the Obligatory Prayer; this is the command of God, the Incomparable, the Unrestrained. | \[no break\] O supreme pen! Say - O concourse of creation! We have ordained unto you the fast during a limited number of days, and we have appointed the Nayrooz as a festival after the completion thereof. Thus doth the sun of revelation shine forth from the horizons of the book on the part of the Lord of origin and return. (Beginning and end) Place the days which are in excess over the months, (that is, the days required to bring the Bahá'i year 361 \[19 times 19\] days, into correspondence with the solar year) before the month of fasting. Verily we have made them types of the letter Ha (value is five) chosen from the nights and days. Therefore they are not included in the months of the year. During these five days it is incumbent on the people of Bahá to feast themselves and their relatives, then the poor and the needy, and to praise, magnify and glorify and thank their Lord with joy and gladness - and when the days of giving which precede the days of abstinence are ended; then let them enter upon the fast - thus ordaineth the Lord of men.

There is no obligation (to fast) upon the traveller, upon the sick, upon the pregnant woman, nor upon her who giveth suck - these hath God excused a favor on His part. Verily He is the mighty, the bountiful! These are the ordinances of God which have been written by the supreme pen in the books and the tablets.

Hold firmly to the commands of God and His ordinances, and be not of those who adopt their own principles and fling God's principles behind them, because they follow imagination and fancies.  
  
Abstain from eating and drinking from sunrise until sunset. Beware lest lust withold you from this favor which hath been decreed in the book. God hath ordained unto him who professeth faith in God, to bathe every day his hands and face, then sit down, turn to God and say: "Allah'ho'Abha" ninety-five times. Thus hath it been decreed by the creator of the earth and heaven, when with greatness and might He descended upon the throne of names. Perform ablutions before prayer as a command on the part of God, the One, the unconstrained.

#### 19

Ye have been forbidden to commit murder or adultery, or to engage in backbiting or calumny; shun ye, then, what hath been prohibited in the holy Books and Tablets.

#### 20

We have divided inheritance into seven categories: to the children, We have allotted nine parts comprising five hundred and forty shares; to the wife, eight parts comprising four hundred and eighty shares; to the father, seven parts comprising four hundred and twenty shares; to the mother, six parts comprising three hundred and sixty shares; to the brothers, five parts or three hundred shares; to the sisters, four parts or two hundred and forty shares; and to the teachers, three parts or one hundred and eighty shares. Such was the ordinance of My Forerunner, He Who extolleth My Name in the night season and at the break of day. When We heard the clamour of the children as yet unborn, We doubled their share and decreased those of the rest. He, of a truth, hath power to ordain whatsoever He desireth, and He doeth as He pleaseth by virtue of His sovereign might.

#### 21

Should the deceased leave no offspring, their share shall revert to the House of Justice, to be expended by the Trustees of the All-Merciful on the orphaned and widowed, and on whatsoever will bring benefit to the generality of the people, that all may give thanks unto their Lord, the All- Gracious, the Pardoner.  
  
  
  
 | Murder, adultery, slandering, backbiting and calumniating, are strictly prohibited - shun that whereof ye are forbidden in the books and tablets.

The laws of inheritance are laid down as follows, and are divided after the types of the letter Za (the seventh letter of the Abjad quotation). i.e. Into seven divisions:-

(1) The offspring's share is ordained unto him from the book Tha (which is the ninth letter of Abjad quotation) according to the numerical value of the word, Makt (which equals 540) N.B. (The division of inheritance runs from the letter nine on the Abjad quotation, which is Tha to the third letter, which is Jeem - but as nine is the numerical value of Bahá, the Manifestation, commenced from the letter Tha, which is equivalent to nine).

(2) The husband's or wife's share is ordained from the book of Ha; according to the value of Tha and Sa (which equals 480).

(3) The father's share is ordained from the book of Za according to the value of Tha and Kaf (which equals 420).

(4) The mother's share is ordained from the book of Waw, according to the numerical value of the word Rafua (which equals 360).

(5) The brother's share is ordained from the book of Hah, according to the value of Sheen, (which is 300).

(6) The sister's share is ordained from the book Dal, according to the value of Rar, and Mim (240).

(7) The teacher's share is ordained from the book of Jeem, according to the value of Kaf and Fah (which equals 180).

Thus hath it been decided by my precursor (the Bab) who mentioned Me by night and day - but when we heard the outcry of the children while they were yet unborn, we have doubled their shares and reduced those of the others - Verily He is the powerful over what He pleaseth, and doeth what He willeth.*****

If anyone dies without heirs, the house of justice has the right to the property and it should be expended by the house, bring the trustees of the merciful - for the widows and orphans, and for any purpose that may result in the welfare of the commonwealth: that they may give thanks to their Lord, the precious, the pardoner. \[ol> ***** (According to the laws of the Bab the share of the children was only 540, but being doubled by the manifestation it became 1080. The additional 540 which was granted to them must consequently be subtracted from the other six shares equally - that is ninety from each share - hence the seven divisions run as follows:-

Law of the Bab             Law of the Manifestation    
Children          540      Children          1080   
Husband and wife  480      Husband and wife  390   
Father            420      Father            330   
Mother            360      Mother            270   
Brothers          300      Brothers          210   
Sisters           240      Sisters           150   
Teacher           180      Teacher           90    
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-           \-\-\-      \-\-\-\-\-\-\-           \-\-\-  
2520                       2520So every inheritance is divided into 2520 and should be distributed to the heirs according to the foregoing law of the manifestation - the 2520 can be regarded as either English pounds, dollars or cents.)

 |
| 

#### 22

Should the deceased leave offspring, but none of the other categories of heirs that have been specified in the Book, they shall receive two thirds of the inheritance and the remaining third shall revert to the House of Justice. Such is the command which hath been given, in majesty and glory, by Him Who is the All-Possessing, the Most High.

#### 23

If the deceased should leave none of the specified heirs, but have among his relatives nephews and nieces, whether on his brother's or his sister's side, two thirds of the inheritance shall pass to them; or, lacking these, to his uncles and aunts on both his father's and his mother's side, and after them to their sons and daughters. The remaining third of the inheritance shall, in any case, revert to the Seat of Justice. Thus hath it been laid down in the Book by Him Who ruleth over all men.

#### 24

Should the deceased be survived by none of those whose names have been recorded by the Pen of the Most High, his estate shall, in its entirety, revert to the aforementioned Seat that it may be expended on that which is prescribed by God. He, verily, is the Ordainer, the Omnipotent. | \[no break\] If one dies leaving children only, and no other relatives as limited in the book, they will have two thirds and the other third goes to the house of justice. Thus the independent, the exalted, with glory and greatness hath decreed! If one dies leaving no one to inherit his property, and he has other relatives, whether nephews or nieces, they will have the two thirds - otherwise the two thirds will, go to the uncles and aunts (fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters) after them to their sons and daughters; the other third goes to the house of justice, as a command in the book, on the part of God, the ruler of persons. If one dies without such relatives as mentioned in the book - by the supreme pen all his properties will go to the house to be expended for that whereof God hath commanded. Verily He is the giver, the bountiful! |
| 

#### 25

We have assigned the residence and personal clothing of the deceased to the male, not female, offspring, nor to the other heirs. He, verily, is the Munificent, the All-Bountiful.

#### 26

Should the son of the deceased have passed away in the days of his father and have left children, they will inherit their father's share, as prescribed in the Book of God. Divide ye their share amongst them with perfect justice. Thus have the billows of the Ocean of Utterance surged, casting forth the pearls of the laws decreed by the Lord of all mankind.

#### 27

If the deceased should leave children who are under age, their share of the inheritance must be entrusted to a reliable individual, or to a company, that it may be invested on their behalf in trade and business until they come of age. The trustee should be assigned a due share of the profit that hath accrued to it from being thus employed. |   
  
**\[Verse 25 missing from the Haddad translation\]**  
  
\[no break\] If one dies while his father still lives and he has children, the children will inherit what was allotted to their father in the book of God. Thus are ye commanded to divide amongst them, in accordance with pure justice. Thus hath the sea of words moved, and sent forth the pearls of ordinances, on the part of the king of man.

If one dies leaving behind children under age, or incapable of managing their own affairs, their properties should be confided to a trustee, or the house of partnership, to invest or trade with the children attain their maturity. (If a trustee, he should be awarded in return for his services, a part of the acquired profits \[sic — no closing parenthesis\] -

#### 28

Division of the estate should take place only after the Huququ'llah hath been paid, any debts have been settled, the expenses of the funeral and burial defrayed, and such provision made that the deceased may be carried to his resting-place with dignity and honour. Thus hath it been ordained by Him Who is Lord of the beginning and the end.

#### 29

Say: This is that hidden knowledge which shall never change, since its beginning is with nine, the symbol that betokeneth the concealed and manifest, the inviolable and unapproachably exalted Name. As for what We have appropriated to the children, this is a bounty conferred on them by God, that they may render thanks unto their Lord, the Compassionate, the Merciful. These, verily, are the Laws of God; transgress them not at the prompting of your base and selfish desires. Observe ye the injunctions laid upon you by Him Who is the Dawning-place of Utterance. The sincere among His servants will regard the precepts set forth by God as the Water of Life to the followers of every faith, and the Lamp of wisdom and loving providence to all the denizens of earth and heaven.

#### 30

The Lord hath ordained that in every city a House of Justice be established wherein shall gather counsellors to the number of Baha, and should it exceed this number it doth not matter. They should consider themselves as entering the Court of the presence of God, the Exalted, the Most High, and as beholding Him Who is the Unseen. It behoveth them to be the trusted ones of the Merciful among men and to regard themselves as the guardians appointed of God for all that dwell on earth. It is incumbent upon them to take counsel together and to have regard for the interests of the servants of God, for His sake, even as they regard their own interests, and to choose that which is meet and seemly. Thus hath the Lord your God commanded you. Beware lest ye put away that which is clearly revealed in His Tablet. Fear God, O ye that perceive. | \[no break\] first paying the portion that is God's right, then the debts owed by the dead - if any: then the expenses necessary for the coffin, the tomb and for the burial of the dead with honor and deference. Thus hath it been decreed by the king of origin and return. Say Lo, this is the hidden knowledge which will never change as it hath commenced by the letter Ta - that indicates the number of the hidden name, the conspicuous, the powerful, the inapproachable!

What we have specially allotted to children is but a favor on the part of God that they may give thanks to their Lord, the merciful, the compassionate! These are the ordinances of God. Do not violate them by your lusts and desires, but follow that whereby ye are commanded by the dayspring of argument. The sincere will regard the ordinances of God us a water of life to the people of all religions and as a lamp of wisdom and victory to whomsoever is in the earth and heavens.

It hath been ordained by God, that in every city a house of justice should be established, the members of which must be according to the number of Bahá, and if the number exceeds this, no matter. (probably nine or nineteen.) The members of the house must regard themselves as the trustees and representatives of God in the created world, and when they enter the house they must consider themselves as being in the presence of God, the supreme, the most exalted; as seeing Him who is unseen and strive to fulfill for the good of the public the trust placed in them for the sake of God, as though they were managing their own affairs, and choosing that which is best. Thus hath it been decreed by your Lord, the Mighty, the pardoner!

Beware not to reject that which is ordained in this tablet. Fear God, O people of vision!

O people of the world! Build ye houses of worship throughout the lands in the name of Him Who is the Lord of all religions. Make them as perfect as is possible in the world of being, and adorn them with that which befitteth them, not with images and effigies. Then, with radiance and joy, celebrate therein the praise of your Lord, the Most Compassionate. Verily, by His remembrance the eye is cheered and the heart is filled with light.

#### 32

The Lord hath ordained that those of you who are able shall make pilgrimage to the sacred House, and from this He hath exempted women as a mercy on His part. He, of a truth, is the All-Bountiful, the Most Generous.

#### 33

O people of Bahá! It is incumbent upon each one of you to engage in some occupation — such as a craft, a trade or the like. We have exalted your engagement in such work to the rank of worship of the one true God. Reflect, O people, on the grace and blessings of your Lord, and yield Him thanks at eventide and dawn. Waste not your hours in idleness and sloth, but occupy yourselves with what will profit you and others. Thus hath it been decreed in this Tablet from whose horizon hath shone the day-star of wisdom and utterance. The most despised of men in the sight of God are they who sit and beg. Hold ye fast unto the cord of means and place your trust in God, the Provider of all means. | O people of creation, build houses of worship in the name of the king of religions, as perfect as practicable, to be decorated with what beseemeth them, but not to contain any images or pictures. Then, in these houses mention your Lord, the merciful, with spirituality and fragrance. Is it not that by His mention the breasts are illumined and the eyes concealed.

Pilgrims to the house are commanded by God, to such as can undertake them (probably the house of Acca); but women are excused as a favor on His part.

Verily He is indeed the giver, the bountiful. O people of El Bahá, it is the duty of each one of you, to occupy himself in some kind of business, whether craft, industry or the like, which occupation will be regarded by Him in the light of a worship before God, the truth!

Reflect, O people, on the mercy of God, and His kindness, then give thanks to Him morning and evening. Waste not your time in idleness and slothfulness, but occupy yourself with that whereby you will profit yourselves and others.

Thus hath the matter been decreed in this tablet from which horizon the sun of wisdom end evidence hath shone forth.

The most hateful of mankind before God, is he who sits and begs. Take hold upon the robe of means, relying upon God, the cause of causes.

#### 34

The kissing of hands hath been forbidden in the Book. This practice is prohibited by God, the Lord of glory and command. To none is it permitted to seek absolution from another soul; let repentance be between yourselves and God. He, verily, is the Pardoner, the Bounteous, the Gracious, the One Who absolveth the repentant.

#### 35

O ye servants of the Merciful One! Arise to serve the Cause of God, in such wise that the cares and sorrows caused by them that have disbelieved in the Dayspring of the Signs of God may not afflict you. At the time when the Promise was fulfilled and the Promised One made manifest, differences have appeared amongst the kindreds of the earth and each people hath followed its own fancy and idle imaginings.

#### 36

Amongst the people is he who seateth himself amid the sandals by the door whilst coveting in his heart the seat of honour. Say: What manner of man art thou, O vain and heedless one, who wouldst appear as other than thou art? And among the people is he who layeth claim to inner knowledge, and still deeper knowledge concealed within this knowledge. Say: Thou speakest false! By God! What thou dost possess is naught but husks which We have left to thee as bones are left to dogs. By the righteousness of the one true God! Were anyone to wash the feet of all mankind, and were he to worship God in the forests, valleys, and mountains, upon high hills and lofty peaks, to leave no rock or tree, no clod of earth, but was a witness to his worship — yet, should the fragrance of My good pleasure not be inhaled from him, his works would never be acceptable unto God. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the Lord of all. How many a man hath secluded himself in the climes of India, denied himself the things that God hath decreed as lawful, imposed upon himself austerities and mortifications, and hath not been remembered by God, the Revealer of Verses. Make not your deeds as snares wherewith to entrap the object of your aspiration, and deprive not yourselves of this Ultimate Objective for which have ever yearned all such as have drawn nigh unto God. Say: The very life of all deeds is My good pleasure, and all things depend upon Mine acceptance. Read ye the Tablets that ye may know what hath been purposed in the Books of God, the All-Glorious, the Ever-Bounteous. He who attaineth to My love hath title to a throne of gold, to sit thereon in honour over all the world; he who is deprived thereof, though he sit upon the dust, that dust would seek refuge with God, the Lord of all Religions. | Ye are forbidden in the book to kiss one another's hands. This is that whereof ye are cautioned on the part of your Lord, the mighty the controller. No one has the right to ask forgiveness of his sins for another, but he must repent to God of his own accord. Verily, He is the forgiver, the giver, the mighty, the pardoner.

O servant of the merciful! Be steadfast in the service of His cause, in such that the afflictions on the part of those who deny the dayspring of the signs will not seize upon you.

When the promised time came and the promised one appeared, people disagreed, end each faction took hold of that which it possessed of imagination and fancies. From amongst the people are some who seat themselves in line with the shoes, in seeking after the seat of honor. Say to them: "Who are ye? O ignorant, and seducers! "Some of them who claim inward knowledge and pretend to understand divine mysteries, say to them: "O liars, by God, what ye have is indeed naught save husks which we have abandoned to you, as bones are abandoned to the dogs." By God, the truth, should anyone wash the feet of the people of the world and worship God in thickets and narrow foot-paths, and upon the summits and tops of mountains and hills, and in the neighborhood of every stone, clod or tree - all the scent of My good pleasure does not emanate from him. This is what hath been decreed by the Lord of mankind. How many servants secluded themselves on the Indian Isles, and deprived themselves of that which God hath sanctioned, and underwent mortifications and hardships and yet were not accepted by God, the revealer of the signs.

Do not make actions a snare to hide hopes and interested motives, and deprive not yourselves of this retreat which was the sole aim of those who are near (to God) in the eternities of eternities. Say: the spirit of actions is My good pleasure and everything depends on My acceptance.

Read the tablets that ye may know what is desired, in the book of God in the created world (seat of honor) and he who is witheld from My love, even though he sits on the earth, will be the one against whom the protection of God, the ruler of all religions will be sought by others.

Whoso layeth claim to a Revelation direct from God, ere the expiration of a full thousand years, such a man is assuredly a lying impostor. We pray God that He may graciously assist him to retract and repudiate such claim. Should he repent, God will, no doubt, forgive him. If, however, he persisteth in his error, God will, assuredly, send down one who will deal mercilessly with him. Terrible, indeed, is God in punishing! Whosoever interpreteth this verse otherwise than its obvious meaning is deprived of the Spirit of God and of His mercy which encompasseth all created things. Fear God, and follow not your idle fancies. Nay, rather, follow the bidding of your Lord, the Almighty, the All-Wise. Erelong shall clamorous voices be raised in most lands. Shun them, O My people, and follow not the iniquitous and evil-hearted. This is that of which We gave you forewarning when We were dwelling in Iraq, then later while in the Land of Mystery, and now from this Resplendent Spot.

#### 38

Be not dismayed, O peoples of the world, when the day-star of My beauty is set, and the heaven of My tabernacle is concealed from your eyes. Arise to further My Cause, and to exalt My Word amongst men. We are with you at all times, and shall strengthen you through the power of truth. We are truly almighty. Whoso hath recognized Me will arise and serve Me with such determination that the powers of earth and heaven shall be unable to defeat his purpose.

#### 39

The peoples of the world are fast asleep. Were they to wake from their slumber, they would hasten with eagerness unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. They would cast away everything they possess, be it all the treasures of the earth, that their Lord may remember them to the extent of addressing to them but one word. Such is the instruction given you by Him Who holdeth the knowledge of things hidden, in a Tablet which the eye of creation hath not seen, and which is revealed to none except His own Self, the omnipotent Protector of all worlds. So bewildered are they in the drunkenness of their evil desires, that they are powerless to recognize the Lord of all being, Whose voice calleth aloud from every direction: "There is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Wise." | Whosoever claims a revelation before the completion of a full thousand years is in truth, a lying imposter.

We ask of God to assist him to return, and if he repents, verily He is the forgiving! But if he insists on what he says he would be overwhelmed by some one who would not pity him. Verily He is the severest chastiser.

Whosoever shall interpret this verse or explain it contrary to its obvious meaning, is indeed deprived of the spirit of God and His mercy which preceded the world.

Fear God and follow not what ye imagine - but follow that which your Lord, the mighty, the wise, commandeth you. The false voice shall be raised from the majority of the cities. Shun it, O people! And follow not every ignoble liar. This is what we have informed you of when we were in Irak (Bagdad) and in the land of mystery (Adrianople) and in the bright watch tower (Acca).

O people of the earth! When the sun of beauty has set, and the heaven of My form is concealed, be not troubled. Arise for the help of My cause (religion) and the exaltation of My word, betwixt the worlds. Verily we are with you in all circumstances, and will assist you with the truth. Verily we are able to do so!

He who knoweth Me ariseth to serve Me with such steadfastness that the hosts of the heavens and earth cannot withold him.

Verily the people are asleep! And should they awake, they would hasten with all their hearts to God, the All-knowing, the Wise! They would cast away what they have, even though it were the entire treasures of the earth, that their Lord might mention them with a word on His part. Thus ye are informed on the part of Him who hath the knowledge of the unseen, in a tablet which hath not appeared in the created world, whereof none knows save Himself who is the protector over all the world. These people were overwhelmed by the exhilaration of lust in such wise as to be blinded from seeing the Lord of creation, whose voice was raised from all directions, and is vocal with the melody of - "There is no God but Me, the Mighty, the Wise."

Say: Rejoice not in the things ye possess; tonight they are yours, tomorrow others will possess them. Thus warneth you He Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Say: Can ye claim that what ye own is lasting or secure? Nay! By Myself, the All-Merciful, ye cannot, if ye be of them who judge fairly. The days of your life flee away as a breath of wind, and all your pomp and glory shall be folded up as were the pomp and glory of those gone before you. Reflect, O people! What hath become of your bygone days, your lost centuries? Happy the days that have been consecrated to the remembrance of God, and blessed the hours which have been spent in praise of Him Who is the All-Wise. By My life! Neither the pomp of the mighty, nor the wealth of the rich, nor even the ascendancy of the ungodly will endure. All will perish, at a word from Him. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling, the Almighty. What advantage is there in the earthly things which men possess? That which shall profit them, they have utterly neglected. Erelong, they will awake from their slumber, and find themselves unable to obtain that which hath escaped them in the days of their Lord, the Almighty, the All-Praised. Did they but know it, they would renounce their all, that their names may be mentioned before His throne. They, verily, are accounted among the dead.

#### 41

Amongst the people is he whose learning hath made him proud, and who hath been debarred thereby from recognizing My Name, the Self-Subsisting; who, when he heareth the tread of sandals following behind him, waxeth greater in his own esteem than Nimrod. Say: O rejected one! Where now is his abode? By God, it is the nethermost fire. Say: O concourse of divines! Hear ye not the shrill voice of My Most Exalted Pen? See ye not this Sun that shineth in refulgent splendour above the All-Glorious Horizon? For how long will ye worship the idols of your evil passions? Forsake your vain imaginings, and turn yourselves unto God, your Everlasting Lord.

#### 42

Endowments dedicated to charity revert to God, the Revealer of Signs. None hath the right to dispose of them without leave from Him Who is the Dawning-place of Revelation. After Him, this authority shall pass to the Aghsan, and after them to the House of Justice — should it be established in the world by then — that they may use these endowments for the benefit of the Places which have been exalted in this Cause, and for whatsoever hath been enjoined upon them by Him Who is the God of might and power. Otherwise, the endowments shall revert to the people of Bahá who speak not except by His leave and judge not save in accordance with what God hath decreed in this Tablet — lo, they are the champions of victory betwixt heaven and earth — that they may use them in the manner that hath been laid down in the Book by God, the Mighty, the Bountiful. | Rejoice not in what ye have possessed in the evening, for in the morning it will be possessed by some one else in your stead. Thus ye are informed, by the All-knowing, the Learned! Say: Have ye seen any endurance or perpetuation for that which ye have? No! By Myself, the merciful, were ye of the just!

Your lives pass away as the winds pass away, and the carpets of your glory will be folded as the carpets of yore were folded.

Think, O people! Where are your past days, and where are your elapsed centuries? Blessed are the days which passed in the celebration of God, and the time which was spent in the commemoration of the wise.

By My life! The glory of the glorious doth not endure, nor the gold of the rich, nor the power of the wretched. All will perish by a word on His part. Verily He is the potent, the mighty, the able! That which people possess of worldly seductions, will not profit them, and they are heedless of that which would profit them. They shall awake hereafter but cannot find that which passed them by, in the days of their Lord, the mighty, the extolled! Had they known, they would have bestowed all their possessions that their names might be mentioned before the throne. Verily are ye not of the dead? From among the people are some who are deluded by science, whereby they are witheld from My name, the protector. And when they hear from behind them the noise or their footsteps, they think of themselves as being greater than Nimrod. Say to them: O ye abundant! Where is Nimrod? By God he is indeed in the lowest hell.

Say, O concourse of the learned! Do ye not hear the sound of My pen, the Supreme? And do ye not see this sun which shines from the most glorious horizon? How long will ye devote yourselves to the idols of your lusts? Set aside imaginations and turn your faces to God, your pre-existent Lord.

Endowments which are apportioned to charity, are confided unto God, the revealer of the signs! And no one has any right to dispose of them - save by permission of the dayspring of inspiration. After Him the decision of such disposal to be confined to the branches; after the branches to the House of Justice when it becomes dominately established in countries; that these endowments be spent in the districts where the religion of God predominates and is exalted and for the things which are commanded by One, potent and mighty, otherwise to be entrusted unto those people of Baha who never utter a word but with His permission, and who do not decide anything but in accordance with the decision given by God in this tablet. These people are the protectors of victory betwixt the earth and heaven. They will spend such endowments in conformity with the provisions laid down in the book revealed on the part of the one mighty and generous.

Shave not your heads; God hath adorned them with hair, and in this there are signs from the Lord of creation to those who reflect upon the requirements of nature. He, verily, is the God of strength and wisdom. Notwithstanding, it is not seemly to let the hair pass beyond the limit of the ears. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the Lord of all worlds.

Exile and imprisonment are decreed for the thief, and, on the third offence, place ye a mark upon his brow so that, thus identified, he may not be accepted in the cities of God and His countries. Beware lest, through compassion, ye neglect to carry out the statutes of the religion of God; do that which hath been bidden you by Him Who is compassionate and merciful. We school you with the rod of wisdom and laws, like unto the father who educateth his son, and this for naught but the protection of your own selves and the elevation of your stations. By My life, were ye to discover what We have desired for you in revealing Our holy laws, ye would offer up your very souls for this sacred, this mighty, and most exalted Faith. | In the event of calamities, whether they befall you or others, be neither sorry nor happy, but rather choose the mention of God under such circumstances, and be vigilant as to that which may befall you* or others, be neither sorry nor happy, but rather choose the mention of God under such circumstances, and be vigilant as to that which may befall you* at the end. \[* phrase duplicated?\] Thus ye are admonished by the learned, the All-knowing! Shave not your heads because God hath adorned them with hair, and in this there are reasons to those who reflect upon the necessities of nature, on the part of the king of the world. Verily He is the mighty, the wise! But the hair must not grow below the level of the ears. This is that which is commanded by the Lord of the worlds.

Theft: To the first or second offence of theft imprisonment or banishment is decreed. But on the third conviction a mar, or sign is to be placed on the forehead of the thief whereby he may be known, and man become aware of him, lest he may be received by other cities and countries of God.

Clemency: Beware not to allow clemency to take hold of you in the religion of God, but do that whereunto you are commanded by one pitiful and clement. Verily we have reared you up with the scourges of wisdom and ordinances for the purpose of your preservation and the exaltation of your station; as children are reared by their parents. By My life, were ye to know that which we have desired for you of our sacred commandments ye would have sacrificed your souls in the cause of this sacred, mighty and impregnable command.

Whoso wisheth to make use of vessels of silver and gold is at liberty to do so. Take heed lest, when partaking of food, ye plunge your hands into the contents of bowls and platters. Adopt ye such usages as are most in keeping with refinement. He, verily, desireth to see in you the manners of the inmates of Paradise in His mighty and most sublime Kingdom. Hold ye fast unto refinement under all conditions, that your eyes may be preserved from beholding what is repugnant both to your own selves and to the dwellers of Paradise. Should anyone depart therefrom, his deed shall at that moment be rendered vain; yet should he have good reason, God will excuse him. He, in truth, is the Gracious, the Most Bountiful.

#### 47

He Who is the Dawning-place of God's Cause hath no partner in the Most Great Infallibility. He it is Who, in the kingdom of creation, is the Manifestation of "He doeth whatsoever He willeth". God hath reserved this distinction unto His own Self, and ordained for none a share in so sublime and transcendent a station. This is the Decree of God, concealed ere now within the veil of impenetrable mystery. We have disclosed it in this Revelation, and have thereby rent asunder the veils of such as have failed to recognize that which the Book of God set forth and who were numbered with the heedless.

#### 48

Unto every father hath been enjoined the instruction of his son and daughter in the art of reading and writing and in all that hath been laid down in the Holy Tablet. He that putteth away that which is commanded unto him, the Trustees are then to take from him that which is required for their instruction if he be wealthy and, if not, the matter devolveth upon the House of Justice. Verily have We made it a shelter for the poor and needy. He that bringeth up his son or the son of another, it is as though he hath brought up a son of Mine; upon him rest My glory, My loving- kindness, My mercy, that have compassed the world. | Eating: There is no harm in the use of gold and silver utensils but beware not to dip your fingers into dishes and plates (served at the repast) but adopt refined manners of the people of Rizwan (Paradise) in His kingdom, the impregnable, the inaccessible!

Under all circumstances conform yourselves to refined manners, lest your eyes fall upon anything that might be abominable both unto you and unto the people of paradise. He who is wanting in this will be condemned at the moment of committing the act, but if be has any excuse to offer, God will forgive him; verily He is the beloved, the generous.

There is no partner of the day-spring of the command in His great infallibility because He is indeed the manifestation of the word, "He doeth what He pleaseth in the realm of creation," and thus God hath assigned this station unto Himself and hath not ordained unto any one the sharing with Him this great and inaccessible honor.*****

This is the command of God which was hidden by the veils of the unseen, but we have disclosed it in this manifestation whereby we rent in sunder the veils of those who did not know the law of the book and were of those who are heedless.

It is the duty of fathers to educate their sons and daughters in science, handwriting and other studies as thoroughly defined in the tablet: But the father who neglects that whereunto he is commanded the trustees must take from him - if he is rich - what is necessary to the education of his children; but if he is poor he must appeal to the house of justice as we have made it a refuge for the poor and needy. If one educates his own son, or another's son, it is as if he has educated My own son - Upon him is My glory - Baha - grace and mercy which hath preceded the worlds.

***** (Infallibility here, does not signify the same meaning as generally understood by the people, "Prevention from sin or error," nay, rather it means the station as held by the lawgiver which excludes Him from being governed by the laws that He gives to the people.

God hath imposed a fine on every adulterer and adulteress, to be paid to the House of Justice: nine mithqals of gold, to be doubled if they should repeat the offence. Such is the penalty which He Who is the Lord of Names hath assigned them in this world; and in the world to come He hath ordained for them a humiliating torment. Should anyone be afflicted by a sin, it behoveth him to repent thereof and return unto his Lord. He, verily, granteth forgiveness unto whomsoever He willeth, and none may question that which it pleaseth Him to ordain. He is, in truth, the Ever- Forgiving, the Almighty, the All-Praised.

#### 50

Beware lest ye be hindered by the veils of glory from partaking of the crystal waters of this living Fountain. Seize ye the chalice of salvation at this dawntide in the name of Him Who causeth the day to break, and drink your fill in praise of Him Who is the All-Glorious, the Incomparable.

We have made it lawful for you to listen to music and singing. Take heed, however, lest listening thereto should cause you to overstep the bounds of propriety and dignity. Let your joy be the joy born of My Most Great Name, a Name that bringeth rapture to the heart, and filleth with ecstasy the minds of all who have drawn nigh unto God. We, verily, have made music as a ladder for your souls, a means whereby they may be lifted up unto the realm on high; make it not, therefore, as wings to self and passion. Truly, We are loath to see you numbered with the foolish. | It is decreed by God that whosoever commits adultery, either man or woman, a fine of nine mithkals of gold should be paid by him or her to the house of justice as an atonement for the crime, and if the action is repeated, the fine must be doubled: This is that which, as decreed by God, the king of names, in this world, and in the world to come a despised torment is awaiting them both.

He who falls into transgression has to repent and return to God, verily He forgiveth Whom He pleaseth and is not questioned of that which He desireth: Verily He is the beloved, the pardoner, the extolled.

Beware lest the veils of Glory withold you from the pure water of this spring - take the cups of victory in this morning, in the name of the creator of dawns (Lit. made the dawns to break); then drink to the commemoration of Him, the mighty, the wonderful.

We have permitted you to listen to harmonies, tunes and melodies; but beware not to allow this to make you go beyond the limit, of politeness, dignity and honesty. Rejoice in the joy of My greatest name, whereby the hearts have become passionate in love and the minds of the proximate (those near to God) were attracted. Verily we have made it (music) the ladder for the ascension of the spirits unto the supreme horizon. Therefore do not make it the wings of passion and lust. I ask the protection of God that ye may not be of those who are ignorant.

We have decreed that a third part of all fines shall go to the Seat of Justice, and We admonish its men to observe pure justice, that they may expend what is thus accumulated for such purposes as have been enjoined upon them by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. O ye Men of Justice! Be ye, in the realm of God, shepherds unto His sheep and guard them from the ravening wolves that have appeared in disguise, even as ye would guard your own sons. Thus exhorteth you the Counsellor, the Faithful.

#### 53

Should differences arise amongst you over any matter, refer it to God while the Sun still shineth above the horizon of this Heaven and, when it hath set, refer ye to whatsoever hath been sent down by Him. This, verily, is sufficient unto the peoples of the world. Say: Let not your hearts be perturbed, O people, when the glory of My Presence is withdrawn, and the ocean of My utterance is stilled. In My presence amongst you there is a wisdom, and in My absence there is yet another, inscrutable to all but God, the Incomparable, the All-Knowing. Verily, We behold you from Our realm of glory, and shall aid whosoever will arise for the triumph of Our Cause with the hosts of the Concourse on high and a company of Our favoured angels.

O peoples of the earth! God, the Eternal Truth, is My witness that streams of fresh and soft- flowing waters have gushed from the rocks through the sweetness of the words uttered by your Lord, the Unconstrained; and still ye slumber. Cast away that which ye possess, and, on the wings of detachment, soar beyond all created things. Thus biddeth you the Lord of creation, the movement of Whose Pen hath revolutionized the soul of mankind. | One third of all fines for atonement should be confided to the house of justice, and we admonish its members to practice pure justice that they may expend the collected sum in their possession in such ways as are commanded them on the part of one omniscient and wise.

O men of justice! Be shepherds of the sheep of God in His kingdom, and protect them against wolves who appear in (sheep's) garments the same way as ye protect your children. Thus admonisheth you the faithful admonisher.

If ye disagree upon any matter refer the same to God as long as the sun is shining from the horizon of this heaven, but if He sets, appeal to that which was caused to descend on His part; very it sufficeth the worlds!

Say, O people, be not troubled if the kingdom of My appearance becomes concealed, and the waves of the sea of My utterance subside: for in My epiphany there is a wisdom and in My occultation there is another wisdom whereof none knoweth save God, the peerless, the All-knowing. We shall see you from My horizon, El Abha, and shall assist them who arise to assist My cause, by the hosts of the supreme world and cohorts of proximate angels. O people of the earth! By God, the truth! The stones gave vent to the limpid and sweet rivers, being overtaken by the delight of the utterance of your Lord, the unconstrained, while ye yourselves are of the heedless.

Set aside that which ye have, then with the foremost wings of separation (from the world) fly away above all creation; Thus commandeth you the ruler of religions by the motion of His pen He hath overturned the worlds.

Know ye from what heights your Lord, the All-Glorious, is calling? Think ye that ye have recognized the Pen wherewith your Lord, the Lord of all names, commandeth you? Nay, by My life! Did ye but know it, ye would renounce the world, and would hasten with your whole hearts to the presence of the Well-Beloved. Your spirits would be so transported by His Word as to throw into commotion the Greater World — how much more this small and petty one! Thus have the showers of My bounty been poured down from the heaven of My loving-kindness, as a token of My grace, that ye may be of the thankful.

#### 56

The penalties for wounding or striking a person depend upon the severity of the injury; for each degree the Lord of Judgement hath prescribed a certain indemnity. He is, in truth, the Ordainer, the Mighty, the Most Exalted. We shall, if it be Our Will, set forth these payments in their just degrees — this is a promise on Our part, and He, verily, is the Keeper of His pledge, the Knower of all things.

#### 57

Verily, it is enjoined upon you to offer a feast, once in every month, though only water be served; for God hath purposed to bind hearts together, albeit through both earthly and heavenly means. | Are ye aware from what horizon your Lord El Abha is calling you, and are ye cognizant by what pen your Lord, the king of names, is commanding you? No, by My life! Were ye to know this ye would have abandoned the world and have advanced with your hearts unto the region of the beloved, and would have been overtaken by the vibrations of the word in such wise that shakes the universe, how much more this small world: Thus of My grace, as a favor on My part, that ye may be of those who are thankful.

Wounds and blows are also atoned for by fines proportionate to their offence, and a certain fine is decreed by the judge according to the degree of gravity: Verily He is the controller, the mighty, the impregnable. Had we desired, we would have justly described the particulars as a promise on our part: Verily He is the fulfiller, the All-knowing.

Hospitality is incumbent upon you once a month, though water only be served; for God desireth to unite the hearts ever through the means of the earth and heavens.

#### 58

Beware lest the desires of the flesh and of a corrupt inclination provoke divisions among you. Be ye as the fingers of one hand, the members of one body. Thus counselleth you the Pen of Revelation, if ye be of them that believe.

#### 59

Consider the mercy of God and His gifts. He enjoineth upon you that which shall profit you, though He Himself can well dispense with all creatures. Your evil doings can never harm Us, neither can your good works profit Us. We summon you wholly for the sake of God. To this every man of understanding and insight will testify.

#### 60

If ye should hunt with beasts or birds of prey, invoke ye the Name of God when ye send them to pursue their quarry; for then whatever they catch shall be lawful unto you, even should ye find it to have died. He, verily, is the Omniscient, the All-Informed. Take heed, however, that ye hunt not to excess. Tread ye the path of justice and equity in all things. Thus biddeth you He Who is the Dawning-place of Revelation, would that ye might comprehend. | Beware not to allow the conditions of passions and lust to set you apart from each other, rather be as the fingers of the hand or the limbs of the body. Thus doth the pen of revelation admonish you were ye of those who believe!

Consider the grace of God and His bounty! Verily, He commandeth you to adopt only the things which will profit you, after that He is indeed independent of all the world.

Your evil actions never bring any harm unto us, so also your good actions never profit us; but we only call you to come for the sake of God; to this will bear witness every discerning and learned man.

When you send hunting birds or animals to the chase, mention God; then that which is caught by them may be lawfully eaten, even though it is dead: Verily He is the All-knowing, the learned; exceed not the bounds of this (law) but be on the path of justice and equity in all matters and circumstances. Thus doth the day-spring of the manifestation command you, were ye of those who know.

#### 61

God hath bidden you to show forth kindliness towards My kindred, but He hath granted them no right to the property of others. He, verily, is self-sufficient, above any need of His creatures.

#### 62

Should anyone intentionally destroy a house by fire, him also shall ye burn; should anyone deliberately take another's life, him also shall ye put to death. Take ye hold of the precepts of God with all your strength and power, and abandon the ways of the ignorant. Should ye condemn the arsonist and the murderer to life imprisonment, it would be permissible according to the provisions of the Book. He, verily, hath power to ordain whatsoever He pleaseth.

#### 63

God hath prescribed matrimony unto you. Beware that ye take not unto yourselves more wives than two. Whoso contenteth himself with a single partner from among the maidservants of God, both he and she shall live in tranquillity. And he who would take into his service a maid may do so with propriety. Such is the ordinance which, in truth and justice, hath been recorded by the Pen of Revelation. Enter into wedlock, O people, that ye may bring forth one who will make mention of Me amid My servants. This is My bidding unto you; hold fast to it as an assistance to yourselves. | Ye are commanded by God to show love and affection towards the relatives (kinsmen of the Manifestation and the Bab) but God hath not ordained unto them any right over the properties of others: Verily, He is indeed independent of all the worlds.

Arson and murder committed deliberately are punishable by burning and death respectively. Adopt the laws of God by the hands of might and potency and set aside those of the ignorant (this refers to the Babis who, through the excess of their zeal, used to commit heinous crimes against those who persecuted them; and in order to stop them, in another place, that to be murdered is far better then to plunder) but if ye sentence them to life imprisonment, there is no harm according to the book: Verily He is the controller over that He willeth.

Marriage is enjoined on all, but beware not to marry more than two wives, and he who is contented with one only, he and she will be in ease and happiness.*****

There is no objection to the one who employs a maid in his domestic service (this refers to the Persians who object to the employment of maids in their domestic services); Thus hath the command been recorded with the truth by the pen of revelation.

O people! Be married that through you may be born those who will mention Me amongst My servants. This is My command unto you - adopt it for yourselves as a help.

***** This law is directed specially to the countries where they marry more than one, two, three, four, etc. But in the countries where the governments do not allow it, the Bahá'ís must cheerfully and ungrudgingly submit to the laws and conform to the customs of the country wherever they may be (as clearly shown in another place.

#### 64

O people of the world! Follow not the promptings of the self, for it summoneth insistently to wickedness and lust; follow, rather, Him Who is the Possessor of all created things, Who biddeth you to show forth piety, and manifest the fear of God. He, verily, is independent of all His creatures. Take heed not to stir up mischief in the land after it hath been set in order. Whoso acteth in this way is not of Us, and We are quit of him. Such is the command which hath, through the power of truth, been made manifest from the heaven of Revelation.

#### 65

It hath been laid down in the Bayán that marriage is dependent upon the consent of both parties. Desiring to establish love, unity and harmony amidst Our servants, We have conditioned it, once the couple's wish is known, upon the permission of their parents, lest enmity and rancour should arise amongst them. And in this We have yet other purposes. Thus hath Our commandment been ordained.

#### 66

No marriage may be contracted without payment of a dowry, which hath been fixed for city- dwellers at nineteen mithqals of pure gold, and for village-dwellers at the same amount in silver. Whoso wisheth to increase this sum, it is forbidden him to exceed the limit of ninety- five mithqals. Thus hath the command been writ in majesty and power. If he content himself, however, with a payment of the lowest level, it shall be better for him according to the Book. God, verily, enricheth whomsoever He willeth through both heavenly and earthly means, and He, in truth, hath power over all things. | O people of the realm of creation! Follow not your material self for it is an instigator to transgression and foul actions; but follow the ruler of all things, who commandeth you to practice virtues and righteousness: Verily He is independent of all the worlds. Beware lest ye work sedition in the earth after being reformed; and he who commits sedition, We are quit of him, and he is not of Us, whereunto testifieth the command of the heaven of revelation.

Verily it is recorded in the Beyan (book of the Bab) that marriage must be according to the consent of both parties, and as we desire love, affection, and union to exist amongst the servants, we have conditioned marriage to the consent of both parents and the consent of enacting parties, lest hatred and detestation come between them; and for some other reasons which we have: Thus hath the command been decreed.

No marriage to be allowed without dowery (this is to be paid by the man to the woman): In cities the dowery to be given is limited to 19 mithkals of pure gold, and in the towns and villages, the same amount of silver, and he who wishes more is not allowed to demand more than 95 mithkals. Thus were the commands written by the hand of might, but he who contents himself with the first degree, it is better for him according to the book; for God is able to unite whom He pleaseth by means of the earth and the heaven. Verily He is the powerful over all things.

#### 67

It hath been decreed by God that, should any one of His servants intend to travel, he must fix for his wife a time when he will return home. If he return by the promised time, he will have obeyed the bidding of his Lord and shall be numbered by the Pen of His behest among the righteous; otherwise, if there be good reason for delay, he must inform his wife and make the utmost endeavour to return to her. Should neither of these eventualities occur, it behoveth her to wait for a period of nine months, after which there is no impediment to her taking another husband; but should she wait longer, God, verily, loveth those women and men who show forth patience. Obey ye My commandments, and follow not the ungodly, they who have been reckoned as sinners in God's Holy Tablet. If, during the period of her waiting, word should reach her from her husband, she should choose the course that is praiseworthy. He, of a truth, desireth that His servants and His handmaids should be at peace with one another; take heed lest ye do aught that may provoke intransigence amongst you. Thus hath the decree been fixed and the promise come to pass. If, however, news should reach her of her husband's death or murder, and be confirmed by general report, or by the testimony of two just witnesses, it behoveth her to remain single; then, upon completion of the fixed number of months, she is free to adopt the course of her choosing. Such is the bidding of Him Who is mighty and powerful in His command.

#### 68

Should resentment or antipathy arise between husband and wife, he is not to divorce her but to bide in patience throughout the course of one whole year, that perchance the fragrance of affection may be renewed between them. If, upon the completion of this period, their love hath not returned, it is permissible for divorce to take place. God's wisdom, verily, hath encompassed all things. The Lord hath prohibited, in a Tablet inscribed by the Pen of His command, the practice to which ye formerly had recourse when thrice ye had divorced a woman. This He hath done as a favour on His part, that ye may be accounted among the thankful. He who hath divorced his wife may choose, upon the passing of each month, to remarry her when there is mutual affection and consent, so long as she hath not taken another husband. Should she have wed again, then, by this other union, the separation is confirmed and the matter is concluded unless, clearly, her circumstances change. Thus hath the decree been inscribed with majesty in this glorious Tablet by Him Who is the Dawning-place of Beauty.

#### 69

If the wife accompany her husband on a journey, and differences arise between them on the way, he is required to provide her with her expenses for one whole year, and either to return her whence she came or to entrust her, together with the necessaries for her journey, to a dependable person who is to escort her home. Thy Lord, verily, ordaineth as He pleaseth, by virtue of a sovereignty that overshadoweth the peoples of the earth. | Every one wishing to leave his home for some other place, is commanded by God to give his wife an appointed time for his return. If he fulfills his promise, he will be of those who fulfill the command of their Lord, and will be recorded by the pen of command a being of those who do right; but if any real excuse prevents him he must inform his wife and strive to return to her. Should these two things be not fulfilled, she will then have to wait nine reckoned months, at the expiration of which, there is no objection if she chooses another husband; but if she is patient, it is better, since God loves those who are patient.

Conform to My commandments and follow not the infidels who are recorded in the tablet as those who are iniquitous (the tablet here means His Holy Spirit, and the Koran refers to it, as the preserved tablet; the Manifestation in most of His writings calls it the Red Book).

If during nine reckoned months of waiting news is received of the return of husband, she must adopt kindness and favor for He wisheth peace to exist amongst His servants.

Beware lest ye commit that which will create obstinacy in your midst. Thus the command hath been ordained and the promise decreed.

If news of the death or murder of her husband is received, which news is proven by publication or by two fair and just witnesses, she must remain in her house until the nine reckoned months have expired, then she will have the right to choose what she wishes. This is decreed by Him who is powerful over the command.

Should any agitation or aversion come between the man and his wife, he must not divorce her but will have to be patient for one year, perhaps the fragrance of love might emanate from them. If at the expiration of a year no fragrance of love is diffused, then there is no objection to a divorce. Verily He is the wise over all things. Ye are forbidden to practice that which ye have practiced after three divorces as a favor on His part,***** that ye may be of the thankful, in a tablet written by the pen of command. And he who divorces his wife is free to take her back after the expiration of one month through consent and love, if she remains unmarried, but if she married another, the separation valid by the new union, except on the occurrence of any other manifest event (either death or murder of her second husband): Thus was the command of the day-spring of beauty written with honor and reverence in the tablet of might and glory.

If a man travels accompanied by his wife, and during the journey some trouble or disagreement takes place between them, he must give her an allowance for one year's expenses and send her back to the place whence she started; or entrust her to a certain faithful one, after giving her what she requires for the journey back to her own home. Verily thy Lord commandeth what He pleaseth, with an authority which encompasseth the world.

***** (one of the Muhammedan laws is that when a man divorces his wife, by saying to her three times, "I have divorced you", or whether he is divorced three times, he can take back his wife by merely giving her to some one else for one night only, and thus the Manifestation forbids this practice)

Should a woman be divorced in consequence of a proven act of infidelity, she shall receive no maintenance during her period of waiting. Thus hath the day-star of Our commandment shone forth resplendent from the firmament of justice. Truly, the Lord loveth union and harmony and abhorreth separation and divorce. Live ye one with another, O people, in radiance and joy. By My life! All that are on earth shall pass away, while good deeds alone shall endure; to the truth of My words God doth Himself bear witness. Compose your differences, O My servants; then heed ye the admonition of Our Pen of Glory and follow not the arrogant and wayward.

#### 71

Take heed lest the world beguile you as it beguiled the people who went before you! Observe ye the statutes and precepts of your Lord, and walk ye in this Way which hath been laid out before you in righteousness and truth. They who eschew iniquity and error, who adhere to virtue, are, in the sight of the one true God, among the choicest of His creatures; their names are extolled by the Concourse of the realms above, and by those who dwell in this Tabernacle which hath been raised in the name of God.

#### 72

It is forbidden you to trade in slaves, be they men or women. It is not for him who is himself a servant to buy another of God's servants, and this hath been prohibited in His Holy Tablet. Thus, by His mercy, hath the commandment been recorded by the Pen of justice. Let no man exalt himself above another; all are but bondslaves before the Lord, and all exemplify the truth that there is none other God but Him. He, verily, is the All-Wise, Whose wisdom encompasseth all things. | If she is divorced on account of some well proved illicit action, no allowance should be given her for the period of her waiting months, thus bath the orb of command been witnessed from the horizon of justice. Verily God hath desired union and justice, and abhorred separation and divorce.

Consort together, O people, with fragrance and spirituality. By My life! Every thing in this present world vanishes and only good actions and deeds endure, and God beareth witness to all that I say.

O my servants! Bring your dissensions to perfect harmony and agreement, listen to what the supreme pen admonisheth you, and follow not the wicked proud people.

Beware lest this world delude you as it has deluded others before you. Follow the laws of God and His precepts; then walk in this path which is spread with the truth. They will be mentioned by the supreme concourse and by the denizens of this place which is exalted by the name of God.

Selling of slaves is strictly prohibited and no one is allowed, by any means, to purchase a slave as it is forbidden in the tablet of God: Thus hath the command been graciously written by the pen of justice.

No one has the right to feel himself greater than another for all are servants and guides to God; directing the people that "There is no God but Me". Verily He is the wise over all things.

#### 73

Adorn yourselves with the raiment of goodly deeds. He whose deeds attain unto God's good pleasure is assuredly of the people of Bahá and is remembered before His throne. Assist ye the Lord of all creation with works of righteousness, and also through wisdom and utterance. Thus, indeed, have ye been commanded in most of the Tablets by Him Who is the All-Merciful. He, truly, is cognizant of what I say. Let none contend with another, and let no soul slay another; this, verily, is that which was forbidden you in a Book that hath lain concealed within the Tabernacle of glory. What! Would ye kill him whom God hath quickened, whom He hath endowed with spirit through a breath from Him? Grievous then would be your trespass before His throne! Fear God, and lift not the hand of injustice and oppression to destroy what He hath Himself raised up; nay, walk ye in the way of God, the True One. No sooner did the hosts of true knowledge appear, bearing the standards of Divine utterance, than the tribes of the religions were put to flight, save only those who willed to drink from the stream of everlasting life in a Paradise created by the breath of the All-Glorious.

#### 74

God hath decreed, in token of His mercy unto His creatures, that semen is not unclean. Yield thanks unto Him with joy and radiance, and follow not such as are remote from the Dawning- place of His nearness. Arise ye, under all conditions, to render service to the Cause, for God will assuredly assist you through the power of His sovereignty which overshadoweth the worlds. Cleave ye unto the cord of refinement with such tenacity as to allow no trace of dirt to be seen upon your garments. Such is the injunction of One Who is sanctified above all refinement. Whoso falleth short of this standard with good reason shall incur no blame. God, verily, is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Wash ye every soiled thing with water that hath undergone no alteration in any one of the three respects; take heed not to use water that hath been altered through exposure to the air or to some other agent. Be ye the very essence of cleanliness amongst mankind. This, truly, is what your Lord, the Incomparable, the All-Wise, desireth for you.

#### 75

God hath, likewise, as a bounty from His presence, abolished the concept of "uncleanness", whereby divers things and peoples have been held to be impure. He, of a certainty, is the Ever- Forgiving, the Most Generous. Verily, all created things were immersed in the sea of purification when, on that first day of Ridvan, We shed upon the whole of creation the splendours of Our most excellent Names and Our most exalted Attributes. This, verily, is a token of My loving providence, which hath encompassed all the worlds. Consort ye then with the followers of all religions, and proclaim ye the Cause of your Lord, the Most Compassionate; this is the very crown of deeds, if ye be of them who understand. | Adorn yourselves with the embroidered garment of actions, and he who attains, through actions and deeds, unto the good pleasure of God, verily be is of the people of Baha, and is mentioned before His throne. Render victorious the ruler of creation, first by good actions and then by wisdom and Beyan: Thus ye are commanded by most of the tablets on the part of the merciful. Verily He is the All-Knowing of all things.

You must not oppose one another and no soul is permitted to murder another soul; this is that which was forbidden unto you in a book which was concealed behind the pavilion of might. Do ye slay him whom God hath quickened with a spirit on His part? Verily this is naught but a great transgression before the throne. Fear God and destr\[o\]y not by the hand of oppression and disobedience that which God bath built up; then follow the path of truth.

When the hosts of knowledge appeared with the standards of Beyan, the people of all religions were put to flight except those who desired to drink the pure water of life in a garden which existed through the breath of the glorious.

God has decreed the purity of the seed, as a bounty on His part to the people. Thank him with fragrance and spirituality, and follow not those who are remote from the day-spring of nearness. Arise with steadfastness to serve the cause under all circumstances. Verily He will strengthen you with a dominion that encompasseth the worlds.

Take hold of the rope of refinement and delicacy in such wise that no trace of dirt appears on your clothes. This is that which is commanded by Him who is more elegant than the elegant; but there is no obligation upon the one who has a valid excuse.

Verily He is the pardoner, the clement. Cleanse every foul thing with water, three qualities of which are unchanged (i.e. color, taste and smell) and beware not to use that water which is changed by the air or any other thing.

Be the element of refinement amongst creatures. This is that which your Lord the mighty, has desired unto you; so also legal impurities of things and that of religious communities is abolished by God as a gift on His part: Verily He is the forgiver, the generous. (This refers to the Shiites - followers of Ali - who believe that certain things and nations are impure.) All things have been immersed in the sea of purity since the first day of Rizwan whereon, with our most comely names and supreme attributes, we revealed ourselves to whosoever is in the realm of creation (Rizwan is the greatest festival and lasts nineteen days, commensing on the anniversary of His manifestation.) This is from My bounty which hath encompassed the worlds, that ye may consort with all religions and deliver to them the command of your Lord, the merciful. This is indeed the crown of actions, were ye of those who know!

#### 76

God hath enjoined upon you to observe the utmost cleanliness, to the extent of washing what is soiled with dust, let alone with hardened dirt and similar defilement. Fear Him, and be of those who are pure. Should the garb of anyone be visibly sullied, his prayers shall not ascend to God, and the celestial Concourse will turn away from him. Make use of rose-water, and of pure perfume; this, indeed, is that which God hath loved from the beginning that hath no beginning, in order that there may be diffused from you what your Lord, the Incomparable, the All-Wise, desireth.

#### 77

God hath relieved you of the ordinance laid down in the Bayán concerning the destruction of books. We have permitted you to read such sciences as are profitable unto you, not such as end in idle disputation; better is this for you, if ye be of them that comprehend.

#### 78

O kings of the earth! He Who is the sovereign Lord of all is come. The Kingdom is God's, the omnipotent Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Worship none but God, and, with radiant hearts, lift up your faces unto your Lord, the Lord of all names. This is a Revelation to which whatever ye possess can never be compared, could ye but know it. | God hath commanded immaculacy, and to wash even that which is covered with dust - how much more then the congealed dirt. Fear God and be of the cleanly. And he on whose garment dirt appears, verily his prayers will not ascend to God, and will be shunned by the supreme concourse.

Use rose water, then the pure attar of roses: This is that which God hath desired from the beginning which has no beginning, that from you may be diffused what was wished by your Lord, the mighty, the wise.

Destruction of books as revealed in the Beyan, is hereby cancelled and we permit you to read of science that which will profit you, and not that whereby you will be lead to dispute and contention in speech. This is better unto you were ye of those who know!

O ye assemblies of Kings! The ruler hath come, and the kingdom is to God, the protector, the self-existent.

Worship none save God, and turn with illumined hearts unto the face of your Lord, the king of names - this is a matter which could not be equalled even by all that ye have, were ye to understand.

#### 79

We see you rejoicing in that which ye have amassed for others and shutting out yourselves from the worlds which naught except My guarded Tablet can reckon. The treasures ye have laid up have drawn you far away from your ultimate objective. This ill beseemeth you, could ye but understand it. Wash from your hearts all earthly defilements, and hasten to enter the Kingdom of your Lord, the Creator of earth and heaven, Who caused the world to tremble and all its peoples to wail, except them that have renounced all things and clung to that which the Hidden Tablet hath ordained.

#### 80

This is the Day in which He Who held converse with God hath attained the light of the Ancient of Days, and quaffed the pure waters of reunion from this Cup that hath caused the seas to swell. Say: By the one true God! Sinai is circling round the Dayspring of Revelation, while from the heights of the Kingdom the Voice of the Spirit of God is heard proclaiming: "Bestir yourselves, ye proud ones of the earth, and hasten ye unto Him." Carmel hath, in this Day, hastened in longing adoration to attain His court, whilst from the heart of Zion there cometh the cry: "The promise is fulfilled. That which had been announced in the holy Writ of God, the Most Exalted, the Almighty, the Best-Beloved, is made manifest."

#### 81

O kings of the earth! The Most Great Law hath been revealed in this Spot, this scene of transcendent splendour. Every hidden thing hath been brought to light by virtue of the Will of the Supreme Ordainer, He Who hath ushered in the Last Hour, through Whom the Moon hath been cleft, and every irrevocable decree expounded. | We see you rejoice in that which ye gathered for others in your stead and deprive yourselves from the worlds which could not be numbered by anything save the preserved tablet.

Acquiring money has occupied you from attaining unto the intended aim. This behooveth ye not, were ye of those who reflect!

Cleanse your hearts from the strong odor of this world and advance swiftly to the kingdom of your Lord, the creator of the earth and the heavens, by whom earthquakes appeared and nations lamented except those who have abandoned the world and adopted that which is commended in a hidden tablet. This is a day wherein the interlocutor hath attained unto the lights of the ancient and hath drunk the pure, clear, cool, and wholesome water of union from this cup, whereby all seas were filled (i.e. the cup of knowledge from which all knowledge is derived). Say! By God! The truth - the Tor \[?\] revolves around the day-spring of the manifestation and the spirit (Christ) crieth out from the kingdom: "Come, come, O ye sons of delusion". This is a Day wherein Koumallah (i.e. Mt. Carmel) hath hurried from longing and yearning to meet Him, and Mt. Zion shouted, "The Promised hath come and that which is recorded in the tablets of God, the supreme, the mighty, the beloved, become manifest!

O ye assemblies of kings! The most great law has been caused to descend in this most brilliant outlook, and every hidden matter appeared on the part of the ruler of fate, through whom the hour hath come, the moon has been cleft, and every decisive matter been fully explained.

#### 82

Ye are but vassals, O kings of the earth! He Who is the King of Kings hath appeared, arrayed in His most wondrous glory, and is summoning you unto Himself, the Help in Peril, the Self- Subsisting. Take heed lest pride deter you from recognizing the Source of Revelation, lest the things of this world shut you out as by a veil from Him Who is the Creator of heaven. Arise, and serve Him Who is the Desire of all nations, Who hath created you through a word from Him, and ordained you to be, for all time, the emblems of His sovereignty.

#### 83

By the righteousness of God! It is not Our wish to lay hands on your kingdoms. Our mission is to seize and possess the hearts of men. Upon them the eyes of Bahá are fastened. To this testifieth the Kingdom of Names, could ye but comprehend it. Whoso followeth his Lord will renounce the world and all that is therein; how much greater, then, must be the detachment of Him Who holdeth so august a station! Forsake your palaces, and haste ye to gain admittance into His Kingdom. This, indeed, will profit you both in this world and in the next. To this testifieth the Lord of the realm on high, did ye but know it.

#### 84

How great the blessedness that awaiteth the king who will arise to aid My Cause in My kingdom, who will detach himself from all else but Me! Such a king is numbered with the companions of the Crimson Ark — the Ark which God hath prepared for the people of Bahá. All must glorify his name, must reverence his station, and aid him to unlock the cities with the keys of My Name, the omnipotent Protector of all that inhabit the visible and invisible kingdoms. Such a king is the very eye of mankind, the luminous ornament on the brow of creation, the fountainhead of blessings unto the whole world. Offer up, O people of Bahá, your substance, nay your very lives, for his assistance. | O ye assemblies of kings! Ye are the slaves, and the master has appeared in the most splendid glory. He summoneth you unto Himself, the protector, the self-existent: Beware lest delusion witholds you from the dawning-place of the manifestation, or the world veil you from the creator of Heaven. Be steadfast in the cause of the intended, who hath created you by a word on His part, and made you the manifestations of might to what was and is. By God, we do not wish to dispose of your empires but we have come only to dispose of the hearts. Those are indeed the views of Baha and to this will bear witness the kingdom of names, were ye to understand! Verily he who obeys his Master turneth away from this world, how much more he who obeys this extolled one!

Set aside homes and advance unto the kingdom. This is that which will profit you in this world and the worlds to come. In this the ruler of might testifies for me, were ye to know!

Blessed is the king who ariseth to assist My cause, and separates himself from aught else save me. Verily he is of the people of the red ark, which God hath prepared for the people of Baha: it is incumbent upon every one to exalt him, honor him, render him powerful, that he may invade the cities with the keys of my name, the protector against whosoever is in the realms of the seen and the unseen. Verily he will be regarded as the light to the human beings, as the brilliant white spot to the brow of creation, and the head of honor to the body of the world - assist him, O people of Baha, with money and souls.

O Emperor of Austria! He Who is the Dayspring of God's Light dwelt in the prison of Akka at the time when thou didst set forth to visit the Aqsa Mosque. Thou passed Him by, and inquired not about Him by Whom every house is exalted and every lofty gate unlocked. We, verily, made it a place whereunto the world should turn, that they might remember Me, and yet thou hast rejected Him Who is the Object of this remembrance, when He appeared with the Kingdom of God, thy Lord and the Lord of the worlds. We have been with thee at all times, and found thee clinging unto the Branch and heedless of the Root. Thy Lord, verily, is a witness unto what I say. We grieved to see thee circle round Our Name, whilst unaware of Us, though We were before thy face. Open thine eyes, that thou mayest behold this glorious Vision, and recognize Him Whom thou invokest in the daytime and in the night season, and gaze on the Light that shineth above this luminous Horizon.

#### 86

Say: O King of Berlin! Give ear unto the Voice calling from this manifest Temple: "Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Everlasting, the Peerless, the Ancient of Days." Take heed lest pride debar thee from recognizing the Dayspring of Divine Revelation, lest earthly desires shut thee out, as by a veil, from the Lord of the Throne above and of the earth below. Thus counselleth thee the Pen of the Most High. He, verily, is the Most Gracious, the All-Bountiful. Do thou remember the one \[Napoleon III\] whose power transcended thy power, and whose station excelled thy station. Where is he? Whither are gone the things he possessed? Take warning, and be not of them that are fast asleep. He it was who cast the Tablet of God behind him when We made known unto him what the hosts of tyranny had caused Us to suffer. Wherefore, disgrace assailed him from all sides, and he went down to dust in great loss. Think deeply, O King, concerning him, and concerning them who, like unto thee, have conquered cities and ruled over men. The All-Merciful brought them down from their palaces to their graves. Be warned, be of them who reflect.

#### 87

We have asked nothing from you. For the sake of God We, verily, exhort you, and will be patient as We have been patient in that which hath befallen Us at your hands, O concourse of kings! | O thou Emperor of Austria! The day-spring of the light of primal unity was in the prison of Acca at the time when you visited El-Massjidil Aksa (the temple of Jerusalem) but thou hast passed by without even enquiries about Him by whom every house is honored and exalted, and every high door is opened. We destined it (the temple) the mikbal of the world (place of pilgrimage) for my commemoration, but thou hast rejected the commemoration when He appeared in the kingdom of God, thy Lord, and the Lord of the worlds.

We have been with thee under all aspects and found thee clinging to the branch and heedless of the root. Verily thy Lord is a witness to what I say. We were overtaken by sorrows at seeing thee journeying for the sake of our name and knowing us not while we were before thy face. Open thine eye, that thou mayest see this most noble outlook; know Him upon whom thou callest day and night; and witness the light which is shining from this magnificent horizon.

O thou King of Berlin! Hear the call from this manifest temple "There is no God but me, the everlasting, the peerless, the pre-existent". Beware lest delusion withold thee from the day- spring of manifestation; or lust veil thee from the king of the throne and the earth. Thus doth the supreme pen admonish thee. Verily He is the bounteous, the generous.

Remember! Where is he who was greater than thou, and of more honor and dignity? And where are his possessions (Napoleon the third)? Awake and be not of those who sleep! Verily he hath put behind him the tablet of God when he informed him of what had befallen us on the part of the soldiers of oppressors. Therefore humiliation has surrounded him from all sides, until he fell to dust with great loss.

O King! Consider his condition (Napoleon's) and remember your equal who have subdued the countries and governed the people. Verily God, the merciful, hath made them descend from the palaces to the graves. Consider and be of the mindful! Verily we desire naught of you, but only we advise you, for God's sake, and we will be patient as we have been through that which has befallen us on your part, O ye assemblies of rulers.

Hearken ye, O Rulers of America and the Presidents of the Republics therein, unto that which the Dove is warbling on the Branch of Eternity: "There is none other God but Me, the Ever- Abiding, the Forgiving, the All-Bountiful." Adorn ye the temple of dominion with the ornament of justice and of the fear of God, and its head with the crown of the remembrance of your Lord, the Creator of the heavens. Thus counselleth you He Who is the Dayspring of Names, as bidden by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. The Promised One hath appeared in this glorified Station, whereat all beings, both seen and unseen, have rejoiced. Take ye advantage of the Day of God. Verily, to meet Him is better for you than all that whereon the sun shineth, could ye but know it. O concourse of rulers! Give ear unto that which hath been raised from the Dayspring of Grandeur: "Verily, there is none other God but Me, the Lord of Utterance, the All-Knowing." Bind ye the broken with the hands of justice, and crush the oppressor who flourisheth with the rod of the commandments of your Lord, the Ordainer, the All-Wise.

O people of Constantinople! Lo, from your midst We hear the baleful hooting of the owl. Hath the drunkenness of passion laid hold upon you, or is it that ye are sunk in heedlessness? O Spot that art situate on the shores of the two seas! The throne of tyranny hath, verily, been established upon thee, and the flame of hatred hath been kindled within thy bosom, in such wise that the Concourse on high and they who circle around the Exalted Throne have wailed and lamented. We behold in thee the foolish ruling over the wise, and darkness vaunting itself against the light. Thou art indeed filled with manifest pride. Hath thine outward splendour made thee vainglorious? By Him Who is the Lord of mankind! It shall soon perish, and thy daughters and thy widows and all the kindreds that dwell within thee shall lament. Thus informeth thee the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

O banks of the Rhine! We have seen you covered with gore, inasmuch as the swords of retribution were drawn against you; and you shall have another turn. And We hear the lamentations of Berlin, though she be today in conspicuous glory. | O ye rulers of America, and Presidents of the republics. Harken unto that which the dove singeth on the branch of duration, which is vocal with the melody of "There is no God but Me, the everlasting the forgiver, the generous." Adorn the temple of the empire with the embroidered garment of justice and piety, and the head with the crown of commemoration of your Lord, the creator of heaven. Thus doth the day-spring command you on the part of one all- knowing and wise.

The promised one hath appeared in this extolled station, and through Him the mouth of existence of the seen and unseen hath smiled. Avail yourselves of the day of God! Verily to meet Him is better for you than upon which the sun shines, were ye of those who know!

O ye assemblies of Emirs (chiefs)! Harken unto that which was raised from the day-spring of loftiness. "That there is no God but me, the utterer, the knower."

Set the broken by the hands of justice, and break to pieces the whole — the oppressors — with the scourges of the ordinances of your Lord, the commander, the wise.

O ye assemblies of El-Room! We hear amongst you the screech of owls — are ye overtaken by the exhilaration of lust, or are ye of the heedless?

O point, which lieth on the shore of the two seas! The throne of injustice hath been fixed in thee, and the fire of hatred hath been kindled in thee in such wise that made the Supreme Concourse and those who revolve around the high throne, lament. We see in thee the foolish ruling over the wise, and the darkness boasting against light. Verily thou art in manifest delusion! Are ye deceived by thine outward adornment? It shall vanish, by the Lord of Creation, and the daughters and widows and those people that are within thee, shall lament and weep! Thus the omniscient, the wise, informed thee!

O banks of the river Rhine! We have seen you drenched in gore, because the swords of retribution were drawn against you, and you shall have another turn, and we hear the lamentation of Berlin, though it be today in manifest glory.

Let nothing grieve thee, O Land of Ta, \[Tihran\] for God hath chosen thee to be the source of the joy of all mankind. He shall, if it be His Will, bless thy throne with one who will rule with justice, who will gather together the flock of God which the wolves have scattered. Such a ruler will, with joy and gladness, turn his face towards, and extend his favours unto, the people of Bahá. He indeed is accounted in the sight of God as a jewel among men. Upon him rest forever the glory of God and the glory of all that dwell in the kingdom of His revelation.

#### 92

Rejoice with great joy, for God hath made thee "the Dayspring of His light", inasmuch as within thee was born the Manifestation of His Glory. Be thou glad for this name that hath been conferred upon thee — a name through which the Day-Star of grace hath shed its splendour, through which both earth and heaven have been illumined.

#### 93

Erelong will the state of affairs within thee be changed, and the reins of power fall into the hands of the people. Verily, thy Lord is the All-Knowing. His authority embraceth all things. Rest thou assured in the gracious favour of thy Lord. The eye of His loving-kindness shall everlastingly be directed towards thee. The day is approaching when thy agitation will have been transmuted into peace and quiet calm. Thus hath it been decreed in the wondrous Book. | O land of Ta (Teheran)! Grieve not because of anything, for God hath made thee the day-spring of the joys of the worlds. If He desires He will bless thy throne with one \[who\] shall rule with justice, and gather the sheep of God, which have been scattered by the wolves. Verily He (ruler) will face the people of Baha with joy and pleasure. Is he not indeed the essence of creation (best and greatest of kings) before the Truth? Upon him is the Baha of Ullah (God) and Baha of whomsoever is in the kingdom of command in all respects!

Rejoice for that by reason of which God hath made thee the horizon of light; for in thee the dayspring of the manifestation was born, and thou wast called by this name whereby the orb of bounty hath appeared, and the heavens and earth were illumined.

Affairs shall be changed in thee, and a republic of men shall rule over thee. Verily thy Lord is the wise, the encompasser! Be confident through the grace of thy Lord, because the glances of favor shall never cease beholding thee and thou shalt be wrapped in tranquillity after disturbance. Thus the matter hath been decreed in a new book!

On that day the faithful shall rejoice in the victory of God, and the disbelievers shall lament.

We hear in thee the voices of men commemorating they Lord, the rich and exalted. Blessed is the day of creation, in my name El Abha. On that day the sincere believers will rejoice at the victory of God, and the disbelievers lament.

No one must object to those who govern the people. Leave unto them that which they have, and turn only unto the hearts.

O thou of the greatest sea! Sprinkle over nations that which thou wert commanded on the part of the ruler of pre-existence, and adorn the temples of men with the embroidered garment of laws and ordinances whereat the hearts rejoice and eyes are consoled.

Should anyone acquire one hundred mithqals of gold, nineteen mithqals thereof are God's and to be rendered unto Him, the Fashioner of earth and heaven. Take heed, O people, lest ye deprive yourselves of so great a bounty. This We have commanded you, though We are well able to dispense with you and with all who are in the heavens and on earth; in it there are benefits and wisdoms beyond the ken of anyone but God, the Omniscient, the All-Informed. Say: By this means He hath desired to purify what ye possess and to enable you to draw nigh unto such stations as none can comprehend save those whom God hath willed. He, in truth, is the Beneficent, the Gracious, the Bountiful. O people! Deal not faithlessly with the Right of God, nor, without His leave, make free with its disposal. Thus hath His commandment been established in the holy Tablets, and in this exalted Book. He who dealeth faithlessly with God shall in justice meet with faithlessness himself; he, however, who acteth in accordance with God's bidding shall receive a blessing from the heaven of the bounty of his Lord, the Gracious, the Bestower, the Generous, the Ancient of Days. He, verily, hath willed for you that which is yet beyond your knowledge, but which shall be known to you when, after this fleeting life, your souls soar heavenwards and the trappings of your earthly joys are folded up. Thus admonisheth you He in Whose possession is the Guarded Tablet.

#### 98

Various petitions have come before Our throne from the believers, concerning laws from God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, the Lord of all worlds. We have, in consequence, revealed this Holy Tablet and arrayed it with the mantle of His Law that haply the people may keep the commandments of their Lord. Similar requests had been made of Us over several previous years but We had, in Our wisdom, withheld Our Pen until, in recent days, letters arrived from a number of the friends, and We have therefore responded, through the power of truth, with that which shall quicken the hearts of men.

#### 99

Say: O leaders of religion! Weigh not the Book of God with such standards and sciences as are current amongst you, for the Book itself is the unerring Balance established amongst men. In this most perfect Balance whatsoever the peoples and kindreds of the earth possess must be weighed, while the measure of its weight should be tested according to its own standard, did ye but know it. | Whosoever owns one hundred mithkals of gold, a nineteenth part must be given to God, the creator of heaven and earth.

Beware, o people, not to withold yourselves from this great bounty. We have commanded you to do this, though we were independent of you and whosoever is in the earth and heavens. Verily there are in this certain causes and wise reasons whereof not wots \[?\] save God, the knower, the wise.

Say, by this, he desired the purification of your wealth and to bring you nigh unto stations which cannot be comprehended by anyone save by him whom God hath desired. Verily, He is the bounteous, the mighty, the gracious. O people, be not unfaithful to the rights of God and dispose not of them without His permission. Thus hath the matter been decreed in the tablets and in this incontrovertible tablet. He who betrays God, will be betrayed by justice, and he who acts in accordance with what he is commanded, the blessings of the heaven of the benevolence of his Lord, the bounteous, the giver, the generous, the ancient, will descend upon him.

Verily He hath desired unto you what ye know not today but the people shall know it hereafter when the spirits fly away and the carpets of pleasures are folded.

Thus remindeth you, He who has the preserved tablet. Miscellaneous letters have come before the throne of those who believed, asking God, the Lord of the visible and the invisible, the Lord of the worlds (regarding the conduct, ordinances, laws, etc,) therefore, we have revealed this tablet, adorned with the best form of command, that the people may know the ordinances of their Lord. Also we were asked (the same) on some former occasions during successive years, but we restrained the pen for a reason on our part until at last, letters have come from many others, in those days, and accordingly we have answered them with the truth whereby the hearts will be quickened.

Say, o ye assemblies of learned men! Judge not the book of God according to what you know of rules and sciences; verily it is the balance of truth amongst the creatures, and that which nations have will be weighed and judged by this, the greatest balance — verily it stands alone, were ye to know!

The eye of My loving-kindness weepeth sore over you, inasmuch as ye have failed to recognize the One upon Whom ye have been calling in the daytime and in the night season, at even and at morn. Advance, O people, with snow-white faces and radiant hearts, unto the blest and crimson Spot, wherein the Sadratu'l-Muntaha is calling: "Verily, there is none other God beside Me, the Omnipotent Protector, the Self-Subsisting!"

#### 101

O ye leaders of religion! Who is the man amongst you that can rival Me in vision or insight? Where is he to be found that dareth to claim to be My equal in utterance or wisdom? No, by My Lord, the All-Merciful! All on the earth shall pass away; and this is the face of your Lord, the Almighty, the Well-Beloved.

#### 102

We have decreed, O people, that the highest and last end of all learning be the recognition of Him Who is the Object of all knowledge; and yet, behold how ye have allowed your learning to shut you out, as by a veil, from Him Who is the Dayspring of this Light, through Whom every hidden thing hath been revealed. Could ye but discover the source whence the splendour of this utterance is diffused, ye would cast away the peoples of the world and all that they possess, and would draw nigh unto this most blessed Seat of glory. | The eye of My providence weepeth over you for that you did not know the one upon whom you called morning and evening, at dawn and eventide. Turn, o people, with bright faces and illuminated hearts towards the blessed red spot in which the Sadrat-El-Muntaha (divine tree) crieth out, "Verily there is no God but Me, the protector, the self-Existent."

O ye assemblies of learned (ones)! Can anyone of you cope with me in the field of revelation and knowledge? Or can anyone follow round the race-course of wisdom and expression? (are challenged to reproduce a like book). No, by my Lord, the merciful! Everything upon this earth is perishable, and will not endure except the face of your Lord, the precious, the beloved!

O people! We have ordained sciences for the purpose of knowing the known; but by them you were veiled from Him who is the dawning-place of such sciences and by whom every hidden matter became manifest. Were ye to know the horizon wherefrom the sun of speech hath shone, you would have rejected all mankind and that which is in their possessions and advanced unto the extolled station.

Say: This, verily, is the heaven in which the Mother Book is treasured, could ye but comprehend it. He it is Who hath caused the Rock to shout, and the Burning Bush to lift up its voice, upon the Mount rising above the Holy Land, and proclaim: "The Kingdom is God's, the sovereign Lord of all, the All-Powerful, the Loving!"

#### 104

We have not entered any school, nor read any of your dissertations. Incline your ears to the words of this unlettered One, wherewith He summoneth you unto God, the Ever-Abiding. Better is this for you than all the treasures of the earth, could ye but comprehend it.

#### 105

Whoso interpreteth what hath been sent down from the heaven of Revelation, and altereth its evident meaning, he, verily, is of them that have perverted the Sublime Word of God, and is of the lost ones in the Lucid Book. | \[no break\] Say, this is indeed a heaven wherein exists the treasure and the mother of the book (Baha'o'llah), were ye of those who understand! This is indeed He of whom the book called out, and the Sadrat of the high tower upon the blessed spot cried out, "The kingdom is to God, the ruler, the mighty, the loving."

Verily we never entered schools and studied sciences: but hearken unto that whereby this illiterate one commandeth you unto God, the everlasting. Verily it is better unto you than that which is treasured in the earth, were ye of those who comprehend!

Verily the one who explaineth that which was caused to descend from the heaven of inspiration, contrary to the obvious sense thereof is indeed of those who have reansposed the supreme word of God, and will be regarded as the losers in an enlightening book.

#### 106

It hath been enjoined upon you to pare your nails, to bathe yourselves each week in water that covereth your bodies, and to clean yourselves with whatsoever ye have formerly employed. Take heed lest through negligence ye fail to observe that which hath been prescribed unto you by Him Who is the Incomparable, the Gracious. Immerse yourselves in clean water; it is not permissible to bathe yourselves in water that hath already been used. See that ye approach not the public pools of Persian baths; whoso maketh his way toward such baths will smell their fetid odour ere he entereth therein. Shun them, O people, and be not of those who ignominiously accept such vileness. In truth, they are as sinks of foulness and contamination, if ye be of them that apprehend. Avoid ye likewise the malodorous pools in the courtyards of Persian homes, and be ye of the pure and sanctified. Truly, We desire to behold you as manifestations of paradise on earth, that there may be diffused from you such fragrance as shall rejoice the hearts of the favoured of God. If the bather, instead of entering the water, wash himself by pouring it upon his body, it shall be better for him and shall absolve him of the need for bodily immersion. The Lord, verily, hath willed, as a bounty from His presence, to make life easier for you that ye may be of those who are truly thankful.

#### 107

It is forbidden you to wed your fathers' wives. We shrink, for very shame, from treating of the subject of boys. Fear ye the Merciful, O peoples of the world! Commit not that which is forbidden you in Our Holy Tablet, and be not of those who rove distractedly in the wilderness of their desires.

#### 108

To none is it permitted to mutter sacred verses before the public gaze as he walketh in the street or marketplace; nay rather, if he wish to magnify the Lord, it behoveth him to do so in such places as have been erected for this purpose, or in his own home. This is more in keeping with sincerity and godliness. Thus hath the sun of Our commandment shone forth above the horizon of Our utterance. Blessed, then, be those who do Our bidding.

 | Ye are commanded to manicure your finger, to enter water which will surround your temples, every week, and then clean your bodies; beware lest heedlessness withold you from that which you are commanded on the part of one mighty and great.

Use for bathing, the water which has not been used for any former purpose, and beware not to approach the tanks of the Persian baths, the odor of which is stinking and offensive and scented at a distance before reaching them. O people, and be not of the vile!

Verily this (water) resembles decaying matter and foul and putrid water, were ye of those who know, so also shun their offensive reservoirs, and be of the pure! We have indeed desired to see you the manifestations of Paradise on the earth, that from you may be diffused that will cheer the hearts of those who are near. It is better for one to cleanse his body with pouring water over it, and thus dispensing with entering the water. Verily He wisest to facilitate matters before you as a bounty on His part, that ye may be of the thankful. Ye are forbidden to marry the wives of your fathers. As to the laws regarding youths, modesty prevents us from mentioning them.

Fear God, O concourse of the realm of creation and commit not that whereof ye are forbidden in the tablet, and be not of those who wander madly in the deserts.

No one is permitted to mutter prayers before the people when walking out of doors or in the streets; rather the one wishing to mention God and offer his prayers must do the same either in the house of worship or in his own home. This is nearer to sincerity and piety. Thus hath the sun of laws shone forth from the horizon of wisdom - blessed are they who comply with His will.

Unto everyone hath been enjoined the writing of a will. The testator should head this document with the adornment of the Most Great Name, bear witness therein unto the oneness of God in the Dayspring of His Revelation, and make mention, as he may wish, of that which is praiseworthy, so that it may be a testimony for him in the kingdoms of Revelation and Creation and a treasure with his Lord, the Supreme Protector, the Faithful.

#### 110

All Feasts have attained their consummation in the two Most Great Festivals, and in the two other Festivals that fall on the twin days — the first of the Most Great Festivals being those days whereon the All-Merciful shed upon the whole of creation the effulgent glory of His most excellent Names and His most exalted Attributes, and the second being that day on which We raised up the One Who announced unto mankind the glad tidings of this Name, through which the dead have been resurrected and all who are in the heavens and on earth have been gathered together. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the Ordainer, the Omniscient.

#### 111

Happy the one who entereth upon the first day of the month of Bahá, the day which God hath consecrated to this Great Name. And blessed be he who evidenceth on this day the bounties that God hath bestowed upon him; he, verily, is of those who show forth thanks to God through actions betokening the Lord's munificence which hath encompassed all the worlds. Say: This day, verily, is the crown of all the months and the source thereof, the day on which the breath of life is wafted over all created things. Great is the blessedness of him who greeteth it with radiance and joy. We testify that he is, in truth, among those who are blissful.

 | It is incumbant upon everyone to have a will drawn up, to be adorned with the greatest name, Allah'o'Abha, as a heading, and commencing with a confession of the oneness of God in the manifestation of His manifestation, then should be mentioned that which he deems proper and good, to testify of his favor in the kingdom of command and creation that a treasure may be secured unto him by his Lord, the protector, the trustworthy.

The festivals are confined to two great ones; the first is the days wherein the Merciful hath revealed Himself with His most comely names and high attributes to whosoever is in the realm of creation. The second is the day wherein we sent Him who gave to the people the glad-tidings of this name, whereby the dead rose, and whosoever is in the earth and heavens awoke for the last judgement.*****

Blessed is he who hath attained unto the first day of the month of Baha which God hath called after His greatest name. (The Babi year is composed of nineteen months, each month having nineteen days, a special name being given to every month - the first month is the month of Baha, and the first day of the month is also the day of Baha - the blessing referred to above is given to the one who keeps this day sacred and performs his religious duties as required of him.)

Blessed is he who shows forth the grace of God through their actions and deeds; proving the bounty of Him who encompasseth the worlds.

Say, this month is indeed the first of the months and their origin, whereat the fragrance of life passeth by all the contingent beings. (This refers to the transit of the Sun to the zodiacal sign of Aries which occurs on the 21st of March corresponding to the first day of spring.)

Blessed is he who keeps this day with fragrance and spirituality, and of him we testify that he is of the victorious.

***** The first great festival which is known by the name of Assam and Rizwan begins after the elapse of thirty-two days from the Naurooz feast which takes place on the 21st of March - wherein the sun is translated into the zodiacal sign of Aries - its duration is twelve days only, signifying the time which the manifestation, Bahá'u'lláh spent in the garden of Wajeeb Pasha at the suburbs of Baghdad where He declared Himself to His followers.

The second great festival commemorates the appearance of the first Point, the Bab, which took place on the fifth day of Jamadi Aval, 1269, Mohammedan era, corresponding to May 23rd, 1844.

#### 112

Say: The Most Great Festival is, indeed, the King of Festivals. Call ye to mind, O people, the bounty which God hath conferred upon you. Ye were sunk in slumber, and lo! He aroused you by the reviving breezes of His Revelation, and made known unto you His manifest and undeviating Path.

#### 113

Resort ye, in times of sickness, to competent physicians; We have not set aside the use of material means, rather have We confirmed it through this Pen, which God hath made to be the Dawning-place of His shining and glorious Cause.

#### 114

God had formerly laid upon each one of the believers the duty of offering before Our throne priceless gifts from among his possessions. Now, in token of Our gracious favour, We have absolved them of this obligation. He, of a truth, is the Most Generous, the All-Bountiful.

 | Say, the great festival is indeed the Sultan of all festivals. Remember, O people, the grace of God that was bestowed upon you when you were asleep, and the breath of inspiration passed by and awakened you; and thus you were made to know His path, the clear, the right.

Should ye be attacked by illness or disease, go to the skillful doctors. Verily, we did not remove the means of cures; rather we rectified them by this pen which God made the day-spring of His brilliant and illumined command.

It hath been ordained by God that everyone must come before the throne and lay down the best of his possessions and the dearest things; (this very thing is recorded in El-Beyan, the book of the Bab) but we have exempted you from such obligation as a bounty on our part. Verily, He is the giver, the generous!

#### 115

Blessed is he who, at the hour of dawn, centring his thoughts on God, occupied with His remembrance, and supplicating His forgiveness, directeth his steps to the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar and, entering therein, seateth himself in silence to listen to the verses of God, the Sovereign, the Mighty, the All-Praised. Say: The Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is each and every building which hath been erected in cities and villages for the celebration of My praise. Such is the name by which it hath been designated before the throne of glory, were ye of those who understand.

#### 116

They who recite the verses of the All-Merciful in the most melodious of tones will perceive in them that with which the sovereignty of earth and heaven can never be compared. From them they will inhale the divine fragrance of My worlds — worlds which today none can discern save those who have been endowed with vision through this sublime, this beauteous Revelation. Say: These verses draw hearts that are pure unto those spiritual worlds that can neither be expressed in words nor intimated by allusion. Blessed be those who hearken.

#### 117

Assist ye, O My people, My chosen servants who have arisen to make mention of Me among My creatures and to exalt My Word throughout My realm. These, truly, are the stars of the heaven of My loving providence and the lamps of My guidance unto all mankind. But he whose words conflict with that which hath been sent down in My Holy Tablets is not of Me. Beware lest ye follow any impious pretender. These Tablets are embellished with the seal of Him Who causeth the dawn to appear, Who lifteth up His voice between the heavens and the earth. Lay hold on this Sure Handle and on the Cord of My mighty and unassailable Cause.

 | Blessed is he who goes, in the early morning to the Mashrek El Azkar (house of worship) and mentions his God, remembers His grace and asks forgiveness.

On entering the house he must sit down speechless, listening only to the texts of God, the king, the mighty, the extolled. Say, (the) Mashrek El Azkar is any house built in the cities and villages for my commemoration; thus hath it bee named before the throne, were ye of those who know!

Those who read the signs of the Merciful with sweet tones, will attain by them that which the kingdom of the earth and the heavens will not equal, and through them will find the fragrance of my worlds which no one knows today save Him who is given vision from this most noble outlook.

Say, verily, they (signs) attract the pure hearts unto the spiritual worlds which could not be signified by any expression nor by any sign. Blessed are they who hear!

Render victorious, O people, my sincere friends who with steadfastness arose for my service amongst my servants and for the exaltation of my word in my kingdom. They are indeed the stars of the heaven of my providence and the lamps of my guidance to all creatures.

He who uttereth aught else that that which was revealed in my tablets, verily, he is not from me. Beware lest ye follow any wicked pretender!

The tablets have been decorated with the ornamented seal of the cleaver of dawns, who uttereth betwixt the earth and heavens, "Take hold of the strong support, and of the enduring and solid rope of my command." (It does not mean the real seal - but that meaning is sealed, just as the prophecies of the Bible were sealed until the time came, and they were opened by the Lamb.)

The Lord hath granted leave to whosoever desireth it that he be instructed in the divers tongues of the world that he may deliver the Message of the Cause of God throughout the East and throughout the West, that he make mention of Him amidst the kindreds and peoples of the world in such wise that hearts may revive and the mouldering bone be quickened.

#### 119

It is inadmissible that man, who hath been endowed with reason, should consume that which stealeth it away. Nay, rather it behoveth him to comport himself in a manner worthy of the human station, and not in accordance with the misdeeds of every heedless and wavering soul.

#### 120

Adorn your heads with the garlands of trustworthiness and fidelity, your hearts with the attire of the fear of God, your tongues with absolute truthfulness, your bodies with the vesture of courtesy. These are in truth seemly adornings unto the temple of man, if ye be of them that reflect. Cling, O ye people of Bahá, to the cord of servitude unto God, the True One, for thereby your stations shall be made manifest, your names written and preserved, your ranks raised and your memory exalted in the Preserved Tablet. Beware lest the dwellers on earth hinder you from this glorious and exalted station. Thus have We exhorted you in most of Our Epistles and now in this, Our Holy Tablet, above which hath beamed the Day-Star of the Laws of the Lord, your God, the Powerful, the All-Wise.

 | Any one is permitted, if he wishes, to learn different and foreign languages; that he may deliver the cause (religion) of God to the East and West and mention Him amongst the powers and nations in such wise that the hearts are drawn and the fry bones quickened.

It is forbidden to drink that which will carry away the mind. But every rational being has to do what beseemeth man and not that which is committed by every careless, heedless person.

Adorn your heads with crowns of faithfulness and fidelity, your hearts with the garment of virtue, your tongue with utterances of the pure truth, and your bodies with the fine mantles of morality. All these are the characteristics of the natural disposition of man, were ye of those who reflect!

O people of Baha! Take hold of the rope of servitude and devotion to God, the truth, whereby your stations become manifest, your names, endurable, and your positions and commemoration exalted in a preserved tablet.

Beware not to allow whomsoever is in the earth to withold you from attaining this precious and lofty station. We have enjoined this upon you in most of the tablets and so also in this tablet, from which horizon of the orb of the ordinances of your Lord, the mighty, and wise hath shone forth.

When the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of My Revelation is ended, turn your faces toward Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath branched from this Ancient Root.

#### 122

Consider the pettiness of men's minds. They ask for that which injureth them, and cast away the thing that profiteth them. They are, indeed, of those that are far astray. We find some men desiring liberty, and priding themselves therein. Such men are in the depths of ignorance.

#### 123

Liberty must, in the end, lead to sedition, whose flames none can quench. Thus warneth you He Who is the Reckoner, the All-Knowing. Know ye that the embodiment of liberty and its symbol is the animal. That which beseemeth man is submission unto such restraints as will protect him from his own ignorance, and guard him against the harm of the mischief-maker. Liberty causeth man to overstep the bounds of propriety, and to infringe on the dignity of his station. It debaseth him to the level of extreme depravity and wickedness.

 | When the sea of union sinks away and the book of origin is achieved to the end (refers to the departure of the manifestation) turn unto Him whom God hath chosen, who is branched from an ancient root.

Consider the condition of the people and the littleness of their understanding. They hunt after that which will injure them, and reject that which will profit them. Are they not of those who are straying madly?

From amongst the people we find some who desire liberty, and glory in it; they are indeed in evident ignorance! Verily, liberty ends in sedition and disorder, the fire of which will never subside. Thus doth the All-knowing, the omniscient inform you.

However, know, that the animal is the model of liberty and the manifestation thereof; hence it behooveth man to put himself under laws which would protect him against the ignorance of himself and the injury of the deceitful people.

Liberty does assuredly put man beyond the limits of refined manners and esteem, and makes him of the vile.

#### 124

Regard men as a flock of sheep that need a shepherd for their protection. This, verily, is the truth, the certain truth. We approve of liberty in certain circumstances, and refuse to sanction it in others. We, verily, are the All-Knowing.

#### 125

Say: True liberty consisteth in man's submission unto My commandments, little as ye know it. Were men to observe that which We have sent down unto them from the Heaven of Revelation, they would, of a certainty, attain unto perfect liberty. Happy is the man that hath apprehended the Purpose of God in whatever He hath revealed from the Heaven of His Will that pervadeth all created things. Say: The liberty that profiteth you is to be found nowhere except in complete servitude unto God, the Eternal Truth. Whoso hath tasted of its sweetness will refuse to barter it for all the dominion of earth and heaven.

#### 126

In the Bayán it had been forbidden you to ask Us questions. The Lord hath now relieved you of this prohibition, that ye may be free to ask what you need to ask, but not such idle questions as those on which the men of former times were wont to dwell. Fear God, and be ye of the righteous! Ask ye that which shall be of profit to you in the Cause of God and His dominion, for the portals of His tender compassion have been opened before all who dwell in heaven and on earth.

 | Mankind must be considered as sheep which must have a shepherd for their protection. Verily this is the indubitable truth. We do indeed approve of liberty in some cases but not in others, Verily we are the knowers.

Say, liberty is confined to the compliance with My commandments, were ye to understand!

Should people adopt that which we have revealed unto them from the heaven of inspiration, they would find themselves in perfect and pure liberty. Blessed is he who knows the intended object of God in that which He hath caused to descend from the heaven of His primal will which encompasseth the worlds.

Say, that liberty which profits you is that which is confined to your servitude to God the truth, and he who tastes its sweetness would never exchange it for the possessions of the realms of heaven and earth.

Ye are forbidden in the Beyan (of the Bab) to ask questions, but Go exempted you from this that ye may ask concerning that which is necessary to you, and not that uttered by others before you (refers to superstitions of old times). Fear God and be of the pious!

Ask that which profiteth you in the Cause of God and His dominions, for the door of bounty has been opened to whosoever is in the earth and heavens.

#### 127

The number of months in a year, appointed in the Book of God, is nineteen. Of these the first hath been adorned with this Name which overshadoweth the whole of creation.

#### 128

The Lord hath decreed that the dead should be interred in coffins made of crystal, of hard, resistant stone, or of wood that is both fine and durable, and that graven rings should be placed upon their fingers. He, verily, is the Supreme Ordainer, the One apprised of all.

#### 129

The inscription on these rings should read, for men: "Unto God belongeth all that is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever is between them, and He, in truth, hath knowledge of all things"; and for women: "Unto God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and He, in truth, is potent over all things". These are the verses that were revealed aforetime, but lo, the Point of the Bayán now calleth out, exclaiming, "O Best-Beloved of the worlds! Reveal Thou in their stead such words as will waft the fragrance of Thy gracious favours over all mankind. We have announced unto everyone that one single word from Thee excelleth all that hath been sent down in the Bayán. Thou, indeed, hast power to do what pleaseth Thee. Deprive not Thy servants of the overflowing bounties of the ocean of Thy mercy! Thou, in truth, art He Whose grace is infinite." Behold, We have hearkened to His call, and now fulfil His wish. He, verily, is the Best-Beloved, the Answerer of prayers. If the following verse, which hath at this moment been sent down by God, be engraved upon the burial- rings of both men and women, it shall be better for them; We, of a certainty, are the Supreme Ordainer: "I came forth from God, and return unto Him, detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful, the Compassionate." Thus doth the Lord single out whomsoever He desireth for a bounty from His presence. He is, in very truth, the God of might and power.

 | \[no break\] The number of months is recorded as nineteen in the book of God, the first of which is adorned by this name, "The Protector against the World". (that is Baha)

It is decreed by God to bury the dead in coffins of crystal, solid stones, or fine hard wood. An engraved ring is to be placed on the finger. Verily He is the ordainer, the omniscient.

On the ring, if for a man, must be written, "To God is whatsoever in the earth and heaven and that betwixt them; and God is indeed the knower of all things."

If for a woman, "To God is the kingdom of the heaven and earth and that betwixt them, and God is the powerful over all things." This is what was revealed before (in the Beyan of the Bab).

While the Point of Beyan crieth out saying, "O thou beloved of the realm of creation! Speak of this, by reason of which the fragrances of Thy favor will be diffused amongst the worlds. We have assured all that whatsoever was revealed in the Beyan will not be equal to one word uttered by Thee. Verily, Thou art the powerful over that Thou wisheth! Mercy! Verily Thou art the possessor of great bounty. We have answered His request, Verily, He is the beloved, the answerer!

Should that which is revealed at this time, be engraved on the rings it would be much better for both men and women. verily, we have been the controllers! It is this: - "I came from God and returned to Him, separated from aught else save Him, taking hold of His name, the merciful, the clement." (This word as given by the manifestation is to be engraved on the rings of both men and women, and the foregoing word of the Bab is cancelled.) Thus doth God favor whom He wisheth with His bounty. Verily, He is the mighty, the powerful.

The Lord hath decreed, moreover, that the deceased should be enfolded in five sheets of silk or cotton. For those whose means are limited a single sheet of either fabric will suffice. Thus hath it been ordained by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. It is forbidden you to transport the body of the deceased a greater distance than one hour's journey from the city; rather should it be interred, with radiance and serenity, in a nearby place.

#### 131

God hath removed the restrictions on travel that had been imposed in the Bayán. He, verily, is the Unconstrained; He doeth as He pleaseth and ordaineth whatsoever He willeth.

#### 132

O peoples of the world! Give ear unto the call of Him Who is the Lord of Names, Who proclaimeth unto you from His habitation in the Most Great Prison: "Verily, no God is there but Me, the Powerful, the Mighty, the All-Subduing, the Most Exalted, the Omniscient, the All-Wise." In truth, there is no God but Him, the Omnipotent Ruler of the worlds. Were it His Will, He would, through but a single word proceeding from His presence, lay hold on all mankind. Beware lest ye hesitate in your acceptance of this Cause — a Cause before which the Concourse on high and the dwellers of the Cities of Names have bowed down. Fear God, and be not of those who are shut out as by a veil. Burn ye away the veils with the fire of My love, and dispel ye the mists of vain imaginings by the power of this Name through which We have subdued the entire creation.

 | The dead must be shrouded with five garments of silk or cotton; but he who cannot afford five, it sufficeth him to have one. Thus hath the matter been decreed on the part of one knowing and learned.

To carry the dead further than one hour's distance from the city, is forbidden. Bury him in a near place with fragrance and spirituality.

What was recorded in the Beyan regarding limit of journeys has been abrogated by God. Verily, He is the unconstrained; doeth what He pleaseth and controlleth that He desireth.

O people of creation! Hearken unto the voice of the King of Names. Verily, He is calling you from the region of prison El Aazam, "the greatest, the exalted, the omniscient, the wise." Verily, There is no God but Me, the powerful over all the world.

Should He will, He would wipe out the world, by a word on His part. Beware not to hesitate in this matter unto which have submitted the supreme concourse and the denizens of the cities of names. Fear God and be not of the veiled.

Burn the veils with the fire of My love, and the barriers by this name whereby we have subdued the worlds. (Barriers mean the false teachings of the divines.)

Raise up and exalt the two Houses in the Twin Hallowed Spots, and the other sites wherein the throne of your Lord, the All-Merciful, hath been established. Thus commandeth you the Lord of every understanding heart.

#### 134

Be watchful lest the concerns and preoccupations of this world prevent you from observing that which hath been enjoined upon you by Him Who is the Mighty, the Faithful. Be ye the embodiments of such steadfastness amidst mankind that ye will not be kept back from God by the doubts of those who disbelieved in Him when He manifested Himself, invested with a mighty sovereignty. Take heed lest ye be prevented by aught that hath been recorded in the Book from hearkening unto this, the Living Book, Who proclaimeth the truth: "Verily, there is no God but Me, the Most Excellent, the All-Praised." Look ye with the eye of equity upon Him Who hath descended from the heaven of Divine will and power, and be not of those who act unjustly.

#### 135

Call then to mind these words which have streamed forth, in tribute to this Revelation, from the Pen of Him Who was My Herald, and consider what the hands of the oppressors have wrought throughout My days. Truly they are numbered with the lost. He said: "Should ye attain the presence of Him Whom We shall make manifest, beseech ye God, in His bounty, to grant that He might deign to seat Himself upon your couches, for that act in itself would confer upon you matchless and surpassing honour. Should He drink a cup of water in your homes, this would be of greater consequence for you than your proffering unto every soul, nay unto every created thing, the water of its very life. Know this, O ye My servants!"

 | Honor the two houses and exalt the places that were inhabited by the throne of your Lord, the merciful. Thus doth the Lord of the worlds command you. (One of the houses is in Baghdad, and the other in Shiraz - the throne means Baha'o'llah.)

Beware lest the affairs of the earth withold you from that whereunto ye are commanded on the part of one, mighty and trustworthy.

Be the manifestations of rectitude on the earth in such wise that the suspicions of those who denied God, could not withold you; for He hath appeared in great authority. Beware lest that which was revealed in the book (Beyan of the Bab) prevent you from this book which uttereth with the truth, "Verily, there is no God but Me, the mighty, the extolled." Look with the eye of equity unto the One who came from the heaven of the primal will and might, and be not of the unjust.

Then remember that which has flowed from the pen of my precursor in the commemoration of this manifestation, and what was committed by the people of tyranny yore were adorned. Verily, are they not of the losers? He said (the precursor, or Bab), "Should ye apprehend him whom God shall manifest, you would then ask of the bounty of God that he might grant you the favor of his sitting upon your couches. Verily, it is an inaccessible and impregnable glory! And should he drink a glass of water with you, that would be far greater than for any soul to drink his own water of life; and far superior to any existing thing, if ye, my servants, were to understand!

Such are the words with which My Forerunner hath extolled My Being, could ye but understand. Whoso reflecteth upon these verses, and realizeth what hidden pearls have been enshrined within them, will, by the righteousness of God, perceive the fragrance of the All-Merciful wafting from the direction of this Prison and will, with his whole heart, hasten unto Him with such ardent longing that the hosts of earth and heaven would be powerless to deter him. Say: This is a Revelation around which every proof and testimony doth circle. Thus hath it been sent down by your Lord, the God of Mercy, if ye be of them that judge aright. Say: This is the very soul of all Scriptures which hath been breathed into the Pen of the Most High, causing all created beings to be dumbfounded, save only those who have been enraptured by the gentle breezes of My loving-kindness and the sweet savours of My bounties which have pervaded the whole of creation.

#### 137

O people of the Bayán! Fear ye the Most Merciful and consider what He hath revealed in another passage. He said: "The Qiblih is indeed He Whom God will make manifest; whenever He moveth, it moveth, until He shall come to rest." Thus was it set down by the Supreme Ordainer when He desired to make mention of this Most Great Beauty. Meditate on this, O people, and be not of them that wander distraught in the wilderness of error. If ye reject Him at the bidding of your idle fancies, where then is the Qiblih to which ye will turn, O assemblage of the heedless? Ponder ye this verse, and judge equitably before God, that haply ye may glean the pearls of mysteries from the ocean that surgeth in My Name, the All-Glorious, the Most High.

#### 138

Let none, in this Day, hold fast to aught save that which hath been manifested in this Revelation. Such is the decree of God, aforetime and hereafter — a decree wherewith the Scriptures of the Messengers of old have been adorned. Such is the admonition of the Lord, aforetime and hereafter — an admonition wherewith the preamble to the Book of Life hath been embellished, did ye but perceive it. Such is the commandment of the Lord, aforetime and hereafter; beware lest ye choose instead the part of ignominy and abasement. Naught shall avail you in this Day but God, nor is there any refuge to flee to save Him, the Omniscient, the All-Wise. Whoso hath known Me hath known the Goal of all desire, and whoso hath turned unto Me hath turned unto the Object of all adoration. Thus hath it been set forth in the Book, and thus hath it been decreed by God, the Lord of all worlds. To read but one of the verses of My Revelation is better than to peruse the Scriptures of both the former and latter generations. This is the Utterance of the All-Merciful, would that ye had ears to hear! Say: This is the essence of knowledge, did ye but understand. | \[no break\] This is what He revealed for the commemoration of myself, were ye to know! He who ponders over these texts and understands what is hidden therein of the treasured pearls, by God, he will inhale the perfume of the merciful from the region of the prison, and hasten with his heart unto Him with such longing and yearning that the hosts of heaven and earth could not withold him.

Say, this is indeed a manifestation round which proofs and evidences revolve. Thus hath the merciful caused it to descend. Were ye of the just! (This refers to this book, Kitab-El- Akdas.)

Say, it is the spirit of the books, and is produced by the breath of God through the supreme pen, and by it is smitten whomsoever is in the world of creation, except those who are seized upon by the fragrances of mercy and the wafts of the odor of my benevolence, the guardian of all the worlds.

O people of Beyan! Fear the Merciful, then, consider what he (the Bab) hath revealed in another place. He said;- "Verily, the Kibla (object of worship to which faces turn) is "He whom God shall manifest", and when he moves, the Kibla moves with him (this means that the Kibla and manifestation are inseparable, that where he is, the faces must be turned). Thus hath it been revealed on the part of the Ruler of Fate when He desired to mention this chiefest outlook. Reflect, O people, and be not of those who are straying madly!

Should ye, through your lust, deny him, to what Kibla would ye turn, O assembly of the heedless? Reflect on this, then, be just, perhaps ye may find the pearls of secrets in the Sea which is moved by My name, the mighty, the impregnable.

No one must cleave to aught else, today, save him who hath appeared in this manifestation. This is the decree of God from first to last, and by it the books of **\[missing text?\]** awaits them in the world to come.

This is the commemoration of God from the beginning till the end, and by it, the preface of the book of existence was adorned if ye are of those who perceive. This is the command of God from before and after. Beware lest ye be of the vile.

Nothing sufficeth you today, and there is no refuge to any one save God, the omniscient, the wise.

He who knows Me has known the intended; and he who turns unto me, has turned unto the Adored. Thus hath the matter been decreed and been explicitly shown in the Book, on the part of God, the Lord of the worlds. He who reads one verse of My verses is more benefitted than if he reads the books of both the ancients and moderns. This is the utterance of the Merciful, were ye of those who hear! Say, this is the certainty of knowledge, were ye of those who know!

#### 139

And now consider what hath been revealed in yet another passage, that perchance ye may forsake your own concepts and set your faces towards God, the Lord of being. He \[The Báb\] hath said: "It is unlawful to enter into marriage save with a believer in the Bayán. Should only one party to a marriage embrace this Cause, his or her possessions will become unlawful to the other, until such time as the latter hath converted. This law, however, will only take effect after the exaltation of the Cause of Him Whom We shall manifest in truth, or of that which hath already been made manifest in justice. Ere this, ye are at liberty to enter into wedlock as ye wish, that haply by this means ye may exalt the Cause of God." Thus hath the Nightingale sung with sweet melody upon the celestial bough, in praise of its Lord, the All-Merciful. Well is it with them that hearken.

#### 140

O people of the Bayán, I adjure you by your Lord, the God of mercy, to look with the eye of fairness upon this utterance which hath been sent down through the power of truth, and not to be of those who see the testimony of God yet reject and deny it. They, in truth, are of those who will assuredly perish. The Point of the Bayán hath explicitly made mention in this verse of the exaltation of My Cause before His own Cause; unto this will testify every just and understanding mind. As ye can readily witness in this day, its exaltation is such as none can deny save those whose eyes are drunken in this mortal life and whom a humiliating chastisement awaiteth in the life to come.

#### 141

Say: By the righteousness of God! I, verily, am His \[The Báb's\] Best-Beloved; and at this moment He listeneth to these verses descending from the Heaven of Revelation and bewaileth the wrongs ye have committed in these days. Fear God, and join not with the aggressor. Say: O people, should ye choose to disbelieve in Him, \[Bahá'u'lláh\] refrain at least from rising up against Him. By God! Sufficient are the hosts of tyranny that are leagued against Him!

 | Therefore, consider what was revealed in another place, (of the Beyan) perhaps ye will set aside that which ye have, and advance to God, the Lord of the worlds.

He (the Bab) said: Marriage is forbidden unless both parties be of the people of Beyan; should a believer marry an unbeliever, the possessions of the unbeliever are forbidden him unless that one becomes a believer. This command to be carried out after the cause of "Him whom God shall manifest" in truth, becomes prevalent, or that which becomes manifest in justice. Before that time, you are permitted to exercise this privilege, perchance thereby ye may elevate the cause of God Thus hath the dove sung on the boughs in the commemoration of her Lord, the merciful. Blessed are the hearers!

O people of Beyan! I adjure you by your Lord, the merciful, to ponder with the eye of equity over that which was revealed with the truth, and be not of those who see the evidences of' God and deny them. Verily, are they not of the damned!

The point of Beyan hath in this verse: explicitly declared the exaltation for My command before his, and to this will bear witness every fair and rightly informed person, as ye see today that it has waxed high in such wise that none can deny it except those whose eyes were shut in this world, for which contemptible torture in His days.

Say, by God, I am indeed His beloved, and now He heareth that which is revealed from the heaven of inspiration and lamenteth because of what ye have committed in His days. Fear God and be not of the transgressors.

Say, O people, should ye not believe in Him, do not object to him (the Bab). By God, the combination of the hosts of oppression against him is great enough.

#### 142

Verily, He \[The Báb\] revealed certain laws so that, in this Dispensation, the Pen of the Most High might have no need to move in aught but the glorification of His own transcendent Station and His most effulgent Beauty. Since, however, We have wished to evidence Our bounty unto you, We have, through the power of truth, set forth these laws with clarity and mitigated what We desire you to observe. He, verily, is the Munificent, the Generous.

#### 143

He \[The Báb\] hath previously made known unto you that which would be uttered by this Dayspring of Divine wisdom. He said, and He speaketh the truth: "He \[Bahá'u'lláh\] is the One Who will under all conditions proclaim: 'Verily, there is none other God besides Me, the One, the Incomparable, the Omniscient, the All-Informed.'" This is a station which God hath assigned exclusively to this sublime, this unique and wondrous Revelation. This is a token of His bounteous favour, if ye be of them who comprehend, and a sign of His irresistible decree. This is His Most Great Name, His Most Exalted Word, and the Dayspring of His Most Excellent Titles, if ye could understand. Nay more, through Him every Fountainhead, every Dawning-place of Divine guidance is made manifest. Reflect, O people, on that which hath been sent down in truth; ponder thereon, and be not of the transgressors.

#### 144

Consort with all religions with amity and concord, that they may inhale from you the sweet fragrance of God. Beware lest amidst men the flame of foolish ignorance overpower you. All things proceed from God and unto Him they return. He is the source of all things and in Him all things are ended.

 | Verily he (the Bab) has caused to descend some of the ordinances so that the supreme pen, in this manifestation, may not move in mentioning aught else save His supreme station and His lofty and sublime outlook. But being bounteous and gracious, we have distinctly explained them and diminished the weight of that which we have desired unto you. Verily, He is the benevolent; the generous.

He (the Bab) hath foretold you of that which would be uttered by this wise remembrance; he (the Bab) said:- and his saying is the truth, "That at all events He (God) uttereth, there is no God but Me, the peerless, the one, the impregnable, the magnificent.

This is a station whereof God hath distinguished and favored this wonderful and inaccessible manifestation. This is of the bounty of God, were ye of those who know! This is from his decisive command, His greatest name, His supreme word, and the day-spring of His comely names, were ye of those who comprehend! Rather through His (command) the day-springs and dawning-places become manifest.

Reflect, O people, on that which was revealed by the truth, consider and be not of the transgressors. Consort with all religions with fragrance and spirituality, that they may inhale the fragrance of the Merciful emanating from you.

Beware lest the ardor of paganism (Tahiliat \[misspelling of "jahaliyya"? -ed.\] - the Arabs in time of ignorance) over take you when amongst the people.

Every origin is of God, and to Him it shall return. Verily He is the originator of the creatures and the receptacle of the world.

Take heed that ye enter no house in the absence of its owner, except with his permission. Comport yourselves with propriety under all conditions, and be not numbered with the wayward.

#### 146

It hath been enjoined upon you to purify your means of sustenance and other such things through payment of Zakat. Thus hath it been prescribed in this exalted Tablet by Him Who is the Revealer of verses. We shall, if it be God's will and purpose, set forth erelong the measure of its assessment. He, verily, expoundeth whatsoever He desireth by virtue of His own knowledge, and He, of a truth, is Omniscient and All-Wise.

#### 147

It is unlawful to beg, and it is forbidden to give to him who beggeth. All have been enjoined to earn a living, and as for those who are incapable of doing so, it is incumbent on the Deputies of God and on the wealthy to make adequate provision for them. Keep ye the statutes and commandments of God; nay, guard them as ye would your very eyes, and be not of those who suffer grievous loss.

 | Beware not to enter another's house whilst he is absent, but with his permission, and under all circumstances cling to kindness and be not of the ignorant. It is incumbent upon you to purify your provisions (such as wheat, corn, etc.) and all else besides by giving alms. This is that which was decreed by the Revealer of the signs in this impregnable parchment. (It probably refers to the tithes of 1/19th). If God will, we shall give a full explanation of this origin, verily He explaineth what He wisheth by the knowledge of His part. Verily He is the Omniscient, the wise.

Begging is not permitted, and he who is asked is forbidden to give. All must work; the infirm must be provided for by the trustees and the wealthy; adopt the ordinances and laws of God, then guard them as ye guard your own eyes, and be not of the losers.

#### 148

Ye have been forbidden in the Book of God to engage in contention and conflict, to strike another, or to commit similar acts whereby hearts and souls may be saddened. A fine of nineteen mithqals of gold had formerly been prescribed by Him Who is the Lord of all mankind for anyone who was the cause of sadness to another; in this Dispensation, however, He hath absolved you thereof and exhorteth you to show forth righteousness and piety. Such is the commandment which He hath enjoined upon you in this resplendent Tablet. Wish not for others what ye wish not for yourselves; fear God, and be not of the prideful. Ye are all created out of water, and unto dust shall ye return. Reflect upon the end that awaiteth you, and walk not in the ways of the oppressor. Give ear unto the verses of God which He Who is the sacred Lote-Tree reciteth unto you. They are assuredly the infallible balance, established by God, the Lord of this world and the next. Through them the soul of man is caused to wing its flight towards the Dayspring of Revelation, and the heart of every true believer is suffused with light. Such are the laws which God hath enjoined upon you, such His commandments prescribed unto you in His Holy Tablet; obey them with joy and gladness, for this is best for you, did ye but know.

#### 149

Recite ye the verses of God every morn and eventide. Whoso faileth to recite them hath not been faithful to the Covenant of God and His Testament, and whoso turneth away from these holy verses in this Day is of those who throughout eternity have turned away from God. Fear ye God, O My servants, one and all. Pride not yourselves on much reading of the verses or on a multitude of pious acts by night and day; for were a man to read a single verse with joy and radiance it would be better for him than to read with lassitude all the Holy Books of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Read ye the sacred verses in such measure that ye be not overcome by languor and despondency. Lay not upon your souls that which will weary them and weigh them down, but rather what will lighten and uplift them, so that they may soar on the wings of the Divine verses towards the Dawning-place of His manifest signs; this will draw you nearer to God, did ye but comprehend.

Teach your children the verses revealed from the heaven of majesty and power, so that, in most melodious tones, they may recite the Tablets of the All-Merciful in the alcoves within the Mashriqu'l-Adhkars. Whoever hath been transported by the rapture born of adoration for My Name, the Most Compassionate, will recite the verses of God in such wise as to captivate the hearts of those yet wrapped in slumber. Well is it with him who hath quaffed the Mystic Wine of everlasting life from the utterance of his merciful Lord in My Name — a Name through which every lofty and majestic mountain hath been reduced to dust.

 | Ye are forbidden in the book (Beyan) to dispute, contend, to strike and that which resembles this, which will grieve the hearts and minds, and he who grieves another must pay nineteen mithkals of gold: this is what was decreed by the Lord of the worlds (Bab). (In the Beyan, it is said that this fine must be paid to Him whom God shall manifest). But in this manifestation He has exempted you from such an obligation exhorting you at the same time to be righteous and virtuous as a command on His part in this clear tablet.

No one is to approve for another that which he would dislike himself. Fear God and be of the lofty. All were created from water, and to dust ye shall return. Think of your destination and be not of the unjust.

Hearken unto that which the Sadrat dictates to you from the verses of God. Verily, they are the balance of guidance of God, the Lord of this world and the world to come, and by them the souls fly away into the day-spring or inspiration, and the hearts of the advancers are illumined.

These are the ordinances of God which are incumbent upon you, and these are the precepts of God whereunto ye are commanded in this tablet. Conform to them with fragrance and spirituality; for this will profit you much, were ye of those who know!

Read the verses of God every morning and evening, and he who does not read will not be known by the covenant of God and His testament; and he who turns away from them in this day, verily he is those who have turned away from God since eternities of eternities. Fear God, O ye servants. Be not deluded by meaningless repetitions of prayer and worship by day and by night. Should anyone read one verse only, of the verses, with fragrance and spirituality, it will avail him more than to read with slothfulness all the books of God, the protector, the self-existent. Read the verses of God in such wise that idleness and sadness are averted. Do not load the spirits with that which will depress them; but with what will cheer them so that they may fly away on the wings of the verses to the day-spring of evidence. This is more acceptable unto God, were ye to comprehend.

Teach your children that which was caused to descend from the heaven of might and greatness that they may, in the sweetest of tones, read the tablets of the merciful in the rooms which were built in Mashrek-El-Azkar (house of worship). Verily he who is overtaken by the attraction of the love of my name, the merciful, would assuredly read the verses of God in such wise as to charm the hearts of those who are asleep. Happiness to the one who drinks the pure wine of life, from the utterances of his Lord, the merciful, in this name whereby every high and haughty mountain is swept away.

Ye have been enjoined to renew the furnishings of your homes after the passing of each nineteen years; thus hath it been ordained by One Who is Omniscient and All-Perceiving. He, verily, is desirous of refinement, both for you yourselves and for all that ye possess; lay not aside the fear of God and be not of the negligent. Whoso findeth that his means are insufficient to this purpose hath been excused by God, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Bounteous.

#### 152

Wash your feet once every day in summer, and once every three days during winter.

#### 153

Should anyone wax angry with you, respond to him with gentleness; and should anyone upbraid you, forbear to upbraid him in return, but leave him to himself and put your trust in God, the omnipotent Avenger, the Lord of might and justice.

 | It is incumbent upon you to renew the furnishings of your houses every nineteen years. Thus hath the matter been decreed on the part of one, omniscient and wise. Verily, he desireth to render beautiful all things. Fear God and be not of the negligent; but he who is devoid of means, whereby to execute this demand, is excused by God. Verily, He is the forgiver, the generous.

Bathe your feet once a day in the summer time, and during winter every three days.

Meet gently anyone who has offended you, and reproach him not who censures you; but leave him to himself and rely upon God, the avenger, the just, the mighty.

#### 154

Ye have been prohibited from making use of pulpits. Whoso wisheth to recite unto you the verses of his Lord, let him sit on a chair placed upon a dais, that he may make mention of God, his Lord, and the Lord of all mankind. It is pleasing to God that ye should seat yourselves on chairs and benches as a mark of honour for the love ye bear for Him and for the Manifestation of His glorious and resplendent Cause.

#### 155

Gambling and the use of opium have been forbidden unto you. Eschew them both, O people, and be not of those who transgress. Beware of using any substance that induceth sluggishness and torpor in the human temple and inflicteth harm upon the body. We, verily, desire for you naught save what shall profit you, and to this bear witness all created things, had ye but ears to hear.

#### 156

Whensoever ye be invited to a banquet or festive occasion, respond with joy and gladness, and whoever fulfilleth his promise will be safe from reproof. This is a Day on which each of God's wise decrees hath been expounded.

 | Ye are forbidden to preach from the pulpits, he who reads the verses of his Lord to you, should sit upon a chair placed upon a platform and mention God, his Lord and the Lord of the Worlds. God desireth you to sit on chairs and divans in honor of that which ye have in you of the love of God, and the day-spring of His command, the brilliant, the illumined.

Gambling and the use of opium are strictly prohibited, shun them, O assembly of creatures, and be not of the transgressors. Beware not to practice that which will enfeeble your temples and harm your bodies.

Verily we do not desire unto you but what will profit you and in this all things will testify for me, were ye to hear!

Should ye be invited to entertainments or banquets, accept such invitations with pleasure and cheerfulness; and he who fulfills his promise is protected against menace. (This shows the importance of fulfilling a promise, and acting to the contrary, calamities and troubles will ensue.) This is a day wherein every wise matter has been distinctly explained.

Behold, the "mystery of the Great Reversal in the Sign of the Sovereign" hath now been made manifest. Well is it with him whom God hath aided to recognize the "Six" raised up by virtue of this "Upright Alif"; he, verily, is of those whose faith is true. How many the outwardly pious who have turned away, and how many the wayward who have drawn nigh, exclaiming: "All praise be to Thee, O Thou the Desire of the worlds!" In truth, it is in the hand of God to give what He willeth to whomsoever He willeth, and to withhold what He pleaseth from whomsoever He may wish. He knoweth the inner secrets of the hearts and the meaning hidden in a mocker's wink. How many an embodiment of heedlessness who came unto Us with purity of heart have We established upon the seat of Our acceptance; and how many an exponent of wisdom have We in all justice consigned to the fire. We are, in truth, the One to judge. He it is Who is the manifestation of "God doeth whatsoever He pleaseth", and abideth upon the throne of "He ordaineth whatsoever He chooseth".

#### 158

Blessed is the one who discovereth the fragrance of inner meanings from the traces of this Pen through whose movement the breezes of God are wafted over the entire creation, and through whose stillness the very essence of tranquillity appeareth in the realm of being. Glorified be the All-Merciful, the Revealer of so inestimable a bounty. Say: Because He bore injustice, justice hath appeared on earth, and because He accepted abasement, the majesty of God hath shone forth amidst mankind.

#### 159

It hath been forbidden you to carry arms unless essential, and permitted you to attire yourselves in silk. The Lord hath relieved you, as a bounty on His part, of the restrictions that formerly applied to clothing and to the trim of the beard. He, verily, is the Ordainer, the Omniscient. Let there be naught in your demeanour of which sound and upright minds would disapprove, and make not yourselves the playthings of the ignorant. Well is it with him who hath adorned himself with the vesture of seemly conduct and a praiseworthy character. He is assuredly reckoned with those who aid their Lord through distinctive and outstanding deeds. | The secret of the reversion of the sign of the Rais hath appeared, blessed is he who is strengthened by God to declare his confession in Ess-Sit-Tat which was exalted by this Vertical Alef (|). Is he not indeed of the sincere?*****

How many hermits have turned away and how many negligent have come saying: "Praise be to Thee, O intended of the world."

Verily, the affairs are in the hands of God! He giveth to whom He wisheth that which He pleaseth, and depriveth whom He willeth of that He desireth. He knows the secrets of hearts and that whereby the eyes of the slanderers are directed.

How many heedless have advanced with sincerity, and we have made them to sit upon the throne of acceptance; and how many intelligent have we sent back to the fire as justice on our part. Verily, we are the controllers! Verily, He is the manifestation of "God doeth what He pleaseth", and the master upon the throne of "commandeth what He desireth."

Blessed is he who inhales the perfume of the traces of this pen which it moveth, the breath of God will be diffused over all, and when it reposeth, the existence of tranquillity appears in the realm of creation. Exalted is the Merciful, the manifestation of this great bounty.

Say, because of His endurance of oppression, justice hath become manifest in aught else; because of His acceptance of humility, the might of God hath shone forth amidst the worlds.

Ye are forbidden to carry weapons of defense, save in time of necessity. Ye are permitted to wear silk, and that which refers to tresses and beards (as recorded in the Beyan) is hereby abolished by God as a bounty on His part. Verily He is the controller, the omniscient.

Commit not that which is shunned by the righteous minded and make not yourselves a diversion for the ignorant.

Blessed is he who adorns himself with the beautiful garment of refined manners and moral character. Verily, he is of those who render victorious their Lord by evident and manifest deeds.

***** The sign of the Rais, chief, means the power of the chief rulers, divines, and learned who have had perfect control over the people of the earth during the past ages and decades, but in this manifestation, affairs shall be changed, their banners reversed and the power will be taken out of their hands and given to the faithful believers of God, who will inherit the earth. Ess-Sit-Tat, means the number six (6) which corresponds to the Abjad quotation. In spelling the letter "Waw" (Arabic alphabet), according to the Abjad quotation the letter "Waw" is composed of three letters, two Waws and one Alef, the numerical value of which is thirteen (13), corresponding to the value of ahad (one) who is God. This means, "Blessed is the one who confesses the oneness of God" The vertical Alef (1) is the first letter of the Arabic alphabet, signifying Baha'o'llah the manifestation of God in whose person the confession of His oneness became manifest and exalted: altogether, this means, "Blessed is the one who is strengthened by God to confess and believe in His manifestation, Baha'o'llah" This refers to the very words as pronounced by Sheikh Ahmad El Ahsai, (an Arab) and his disciple Seyyid Kazim (Persian) regarding the appearances of El-Mahdi. Both of them have preached to the people of His nigh appearance and thus they prepared the way before Him. They are famous and their writings are greatly honored and respected by the people.

Promote ye the development of the cities of God and His countries, and glorify Him therein in the joyous accents of His well-favoured ones. In truth, the hearts of men are edified through the power of the tongue, even as houses and cities are built up by the hand and other means. We have assigned to every end a means for its accomplishment; avail yourselves thereof, and place your trust and confidence in God, the Omniscient, the All-Wise.

#### 161

Blessed is the man that hath acknowledged his belief in God and in His signs, and recognized that "He shall not be asked of His doings". Such a recognition hath been made by God the ornament of every belief and its very foundation. Upon it must depend the acceptance of every goodly deed. Fasten your eyes upon it, that haply the whisperings of the rebellious may not cause you to slip.

#### 162

Were He to decree as lawful the thing which from time immemorial had been forbidden, and forbid that which had, at all times, been regarded as lawful, to none is given the right to question His authority. Whoso will hesitate, though it be for less than a moment, should be regarded as a transgressor. | Build the houses of God, and cultivate His countries; then mention Him therein with the hymns of those who are near unto Him; but the hearts are edified only by the tongue, as houses and homes are built up by the hands and other means.

We have ordained a cause for everything on our part; take hold of such causes and rely upon God, the wise, the omniscient.

Blessed is he who acknowledges God and His verses, and confesses that "He is not to be questioned of what He doeth." This is a word which God hath made the beauty of belief and the origin thereof: and by it is acceptable the labor of the laborers. Make the word the object of your regard, lest you stumble through illusions of those who have turned away.

Should He proclaim lawful all that which was unlawful since eternity of eternities and vice- versa, no one has the right to object, and he who hesitates a moment in accepting this is indeed of the erring.

Whoso hath not recognized this sublime and fundamental verity, and hath failed to attain this most exalted station, the winds of doubt will agitate him, and the sayings of the infidels will distract his soul. He that hath acknowledged this principle will be endowed with the most perfect constancy. All honour to this all-glorious station, the remembrance of which adorneth every exalted Tablet. Such is the teaching which God bestoweth on you, a teaching that will deliver you from all manner of doubt and perplexity, and enable you to attain unto salvation in both this world and in the next. He, verily, is the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Bountiful. He it is Who hath sent forth the Messengers, and sent down the Books to proclaim "There is none other God but Me, the Almighty, the All-Wise".

#### 164

O Land of Kaf and Ra! \[Kirman\] We, verily, behold thee in a state displeasing unto God, and see proceeding from thee that which is inscrutable to anyone save Him, the Omniscient, the All- Informed; and We perceive that which secretly and stealthily diffuseth from thee. With Us is the knowledge of all things, inscribed in a lucid Tablet. Sorrow not for that which hath befallen thee. Erelong will God raise up within thee men endued with mighty valour, who will magnify My Name with such constancy that neither will they be deterred by the evil suggestions of the divines, nor will they be kept back by the insinuations of the sowers of doubt. With their own eyes will they behold God, and with their own lives will they render Him victorious. These, truly, are of those who are steadfast.

#### 165

O concourse of divines! When My verses were sent down, and My clear tokens were revealed, We found you behind the veils. This, verily, is a strange thing. Ye glory in My Name, yet ye recognized Me not at the time your Lord, the All-Merciful, appeared amongst you with proof and testimony. We have rent the veils asunder. Beware lest ye shut out the people by yet another veil. Pluck asunder the chains of vain imaginings, in the name of the Lord of all men, and be not of the deceitful. Should ye turn unto God and embrace His Cause, spread not disorder within it, and measure not the Book of God with your selfish desires. This, verily, is the counsel of God aforetime and hereafter, and to this God's witnesses and chosen ones, yea, each and every one of Us, do solemnly attest. | And he who does not attain unto this lofty root and this supreme station, is wafted by the winds of suspicions and overthrown by the sayings of infidels; but he who attains unto it hath arrived at the greatest uprightness. How good is this most glorious station by which name every impregnable tablet is adorned.

Thus doth God teach you that which will rid you from doubts end perplexities, and save you in this world and the world to come. Verily He is the forgiver, the generous.

He is the one who sent the messengers and revealed the books, to testify that there is no God but Me, the mighty, the wise.

O land of Kaf and Ra (Karman)! We find thee in a condition acceptable to God and see in thee that whereof none knows save God, the omniscient, the learned. We know the mysteries of your mysteries for we have the knowledge of everything in a clear table.

Grieve not for that, for out of thee shall appear people of vehement courage who will mention Me with such uprightness that neither the creeds of the learned, nor the suspicions of the doubter could ever withold or veil them; those will look to God with their eyes and assist Him with their souls. Are they not indeed of the firm?

O assembly of the learned. When the verses were caused to descend and The evidences became manifest, we saw you behind the veils, verily, this is naught but an astounding matter!

Ye have boasted of my name but became heedless of myself when the Merciful hath come with evidence end truth. Verily we have rent asunder the veils, beware not to cast over the people another veil. Break to pieces the chains of imaginations, in the name at the ruler of mankind and be not of the deceitful.

Should ye advance unto God, and embrace this religion, work not sedition, and judge not the book of God according to your own desires. This is the sincere advice of God from first to last; to this will testify the witnesses of God and His elect. Verily we have been the witnesses.

Call ye to mind the shaykh whose name was Muhammad-Hasan, who ranked among the most learned divines of his day. When the True One was made manifest, this shaykh, along with others of his calling, rejected Him, while a sifter of wheat and barley accepted Him and turned unto the Lord. Though he was occupied both night and day in setting down what he conceived to be the laws and ordinances of God, yet when He Who is the Unconstrained appeared, not one letter thereof availed him, or he would not have turned away from a Countenance that hath illumined the faces of the well-favoured of the Lord. Had ye believed in God when He revealed Himself, the people would not have turned aside from Him, nor would the things ye witness today have befallen Us. Fear God, and be not of the heedless.

#### 167

Beware lest any name debar you from Him Who is the Possessor of all names, or any word shut you out from this Remembrance of God, this Source of Wisdom amongst you. Turn unto God and seek His protection, O concourse of divines, and make not of yourselves a veil between Me and My creatures. Thus doth your Lord admonish you, and command you to be just, lest your works should come to naught and ye yourselves be oblivious of your plight. Shall he who denieth this Cause be able to vindicate the truth of any cause throughout creation? Nay, by Him Who is the Fashioner of the universe! Yet the people are wrapped in a palpable veil. Say: Through this Cause the day-star of testimony hath dawned, and the luminary of proof hath shed its radiance upon all that dwell on earth. Fear God, O men of insight, and be not of those who disbelieve in Me. Take heed lest the word "Prophet" withhold you from this Most Great Announcement, or any reference to "Vicegerency" debar you from the sovereignty of Him Who is the Vicegerent of God, which overshadoweth all the worlds. Every name hath been created by His Word, and every cause is dependent on His irresistible, His mighty and wondrous Cause. Say: This is the Day of God, the Day on which naught shall be mentioned save His own Self, the omnipotent Protector of all worlds. This is the Cause that hath made all your superstitions and idols to tremble.

#### 168

We, verily, see amongst you him who taketh hold of the Book of God and citeth from it proofs and arguments wherewith to repudiate his Lord, even as the followers of every other Faith sought reasons in their Holy Books for refuting Him Who is the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Say: God, the True One, is My witness that neither the Scriptures of the world, nor all the books and writings in existence, shall, in this Day, avail you aught without this, the Living Book, Who proclaimeth in the midmost heart of creation: "Verily, there is none other God but Me, the All- Knowing, the All-Wise." | Remember the Sheikh who was known by the name of Mohammed Kabl (meaning before) Hassan. He was the most learned of his time, but when the truth appeared he and those with him, have turned away from the truth while those who cleaned wheat and barley have advanced unto God. He wrote, according to his pretensions, the ordinances of God by day and night; but when the unconstrained appeared, he did not profit by them; had it been otherwise, he would not have turned from a face whereby the faces of the proximate were illumined. Had ye believed in God on His appearance, others would not have turned from Him, and that which you see today would not have befallen us. Fear God and be not of the heedless!

Beware not to allow the names to withold you from their ruler; or any commemoration veil you from this wise commemoration! Seek refuge with God, O assembly of the learned, and make not yourselves as a barrier between Me and My creatures. Thus doth God admonish you and command you to be just lest your actions be frustrated while ye are heedless.

Can any one objecting to this cause (religion) prove any claim in existence (prove the validity of his own religion or that of his prophet)? No, by the king of creation! The people are in evident darkness. Say! By Him the sun of proof hath shone and the orb of argument became manifest to whosoever is in the realm of creation. Fear God, O people of vision and deny not!

Beware lest the mention of a prophet withold you from this most great mention, or the authority from the supremacy of God, which is the guardian to all the worlds. Every name was created by His name, and every command is related to His command, the wonderful, the decisive, the mighty.

Say! This is the day of God wherein naught else must be mentioned, save, Himself, the protector over all the worlds. this is a matter which causes all you imaginations and idols to tremble.

From amongst you we find some who take their books as a guide to God, just as all religious communities have taken their books as proofs of God, the protector, the self-existent. Say! By God, the truth, all the books of the world, and the records therein will not serve you in any stead, except this book which crieth out in the midst of this world, "Verily, there is no God but Me, the omniscient, the wise."

#### 169

O concourse of divines! Beware lest ye be the cause of strife in the land, even as ye were the cause of the repudiation of the Faith in its early days. Gather the people around this Word that hath made the pebbles to cry out: "The Kingdom is God's, the Dawning-place of all signs!" Thus doth your Lord admonish you, as a bounty on His part; He, of a truth, is the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Generous.

#### 170

Call ye to mind Karim, and how, when We summoned him unto God, he waxed disdainful, prompted by his own desires; yet We had sent him that which was a solace to the eye of proof in the world of being and the fulfilment of God's testimony to all the denizens of earth and heaven. As a token of the grace of Him Who is the All-Possessing, the Most High, We bade him embrace the Truth. But he turned away until, as an act of justice from God, angels of wrath laid hold upon him. Unto this We truly were a witness.

#### 171

Tear the veils asunder in such wise that the inmates of the Kingdom will hear them being rent. This is the command of God, in days gone by and for those to come. Blessed the man that observeth that whereunto he was bidden, and woe betide the negligent. | O assembly of the learned! Beware not to be the means of discord throughout the countries as ye have been the cause of oppression in the beginning of this matter. Bring the people together to this word, whereby the people crieth out, "The kingdom is to God, the dayspring of the signs." (This means that everything in existence even the pebble, acknowledges God and testifies of HIS favor). Thus doth God admonish you as a bounty on His part. Verily, He is the forgiver, the generous.

Remember El-Karim, when we summoned him unto God, how by following his own desires, felt himself great, after we sent unto him that which consoled the eye of argument in the realms of creation, and completed the proof of God to whosoever is in the heaven and earth. Verily, we have commanded him to come as a bounty on the part of Him the independent, the exalted; but he turned his back until he was seized upon by the Zabanict of torture (the infernal guards guards - the tormentors of the damned in hell) according to the justice of God. Verily you have been the witnesses.

Render asunder the veils in such wise that the noise produced therefrom be heard by the people of the kingdom. This is the command of God from the first to last. Blessed is he who complies with that to which he is commanded, and woe to the neglectful.

#### 172

We, of a certainty, have had no purpose in this earthly realm save to make God manifest and to reveal His sovereignty; sufficient unto Me is God for a witness. We, of a certainty, have had no intent in the celestial Kingdom but to exalt His Cause and glorify His praise; sufficient unto Me is God for a protector. We, of a certainty, have had no desire in the Dominion on high except to extol God and what hath been sent down by Him; sufficient unto Me is God for a helper.

#### 173

Happy are ye, O ye the learned ones in Bahá. By the Lord! Ye are the billows of the Most Mighty Ocean, the stars of the firmament of Glory, the standards of triumph waving betwixt earth and heaven. Ye are the manifestations of steadfastness amidst men and the daysprings of Divine Utterance to all that dwell on earth. Well is it with him that turneth unto you, and woe betide the froward. This day, it behoveth whoso hath quaffed the Mystic Wine of everlasting life from the Hands of the loving-kindness of the Lord his God, the Merciful, to pulsate even as the throbbing artery in the body of mankind, that through him may be quickened the world and every crumbling bone.

#### 174

O people of the world! When the Mystic Dove will have winged its flight from its Sanctuary of Praise and sought its far-off goal, its hidden habitation, refer ye whatsoever ye understand not in the Book to Him Who hath branched from this mighty Stock. | Dominion we did not desire but only the appearance of God end His authority, and God sufficeth as a witness; the kingdom we did not desire, but only the exaltation of the command of God and His praise, and God sufficeth as a guardian; might and power we did not desire, but the mention of God and that which was revealed on His part, and God sufficeth as a helper. Blessed are ye, O assembly of the learned of Baha! By God, ye are the waves of the greatest sea, the stars of' the heaven of grace, and the banners of victory betwixt the heaven and earth. Ye are the day-springs of uprightness amidst the creatures, and the dawning-places of wisdom to whosoever is in the created world. Blessed are they who come unto you and woe unto them who turn away.

In this day it beseemeth every one who has drunk the pure wine of life from the hand of grace of His Lord, the merciful, to be as an artery; pulsating in the body of the realm of creation, whereby the world and all dry bones will be shaken.

O people of creation! When the dove flyeth off from the branch of praise, and moveth towards the farthest and most hidden destination, refer that which ye do not understand of the book to the branch who is extended from this solid root.

O Pen of the Most High! Move Thou upon the Tablet at the bidding of Thy Lord, the Creator of the Heavens, and tell of the time when He Who is the Dayspring of Divine Unity purposed to direct His steps towards the School of Transcendent Oneness; haply the pure in heart may gain thereby a glimpse, be it as small as a needle's eye, of the mysteries of Thy Lord, the Almighty, the Omniscient, that lie concealed behind the veils. Say: We, indeed, set foot within the School of inner meaning and explanation when all created things were unaware. We saw the words sent down by Him Who is the All-Merciful, and We accepted the verses of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting, which He \[The Báb\] presented unto Us, and hearkened unto that which He had solemnly affirmed in the Tablet. This we assuredly did behold. And We assented to His wish through Our behest, for truly We are potent to command.

#### 176

O people of the Bayán! We, verily, set foot within the School of God when ye lay slumbering; and We perused the Tablet while ye were fast asleep. By the one true God! We read the Tablet ere it was revealed, while ye were unaware, and We had perfect knowledge of the Book when ye were yet unborn. These words are to your measure, not to God's. To this testifieth that which is enshrined within His knowledge, if ye be of them that comprehend; and to this the tongue of the Almighty doth bear witness, if ye be of those who understand. I swear by God, were We to lift the veil, ye would be dumbfounded.

#### 177

Take heed that ye dispute not idly concerning the Almighty and His Cause, for lo! He hath appeared amongst you invested with a Revelation so great as to encompass all things, whether of the past or of the future. Were We to address Our theme by speaking in the language of the inmates of the Kingdom, We would say: "In truth, God created that School ere He created heaven and earth, and We entered it before the letters B and E were joined and knit together." Such is the language of Our servants in Our Kingdom; consider what the tongue of the dwellers of Our exalted Dominion would utter, for We have taught them Our knowledge and have revealed to them whatever had lain hidden in God's wisdom. Imagine then what the Tongue of Might and Grandeur would utter in His All-Glorious Abode! | O supreme pen! Move upon this tablet, with the permission of thy Lord, the creator of heaven; then mention that the day-spring of unity hath purposed the Maktab (school) to be that of renunciation (of worldly things).

(This is in reply to a passage in the Beyan which was understood as schools of learning). Perchance the true pure and religious learned men will be acquainted, even though measured by the eye of a needle, with what is existing behind the veils of the mysteries of thy Lord, the mighty, the omniscient.

Say! Verily, we have entered the maktab of ideas and expressions at the time when all of the realm of creation were heedless, and witnessed that which was revealed by the Merciful; accepted that was given unto me of the verses of God, the protector, the self-existent; and heard that whereunto He testifieth in this tablet. Verily, we have been the witnesses - we have answered him by a command on our part - verily, we have been the commanders.

O people of Beyan! Verily, we have entered the maktab of God while ye were reposing, and witnessed the tablet while ye were asleep. By God, the truth, we have read it, before its descension while ye were heedless. We have thoroughly comprehended the book while ye were yet unborn (in the loins); and what I have expounded unto you is in proportion to your limited knowledge of God, were ye to know! To this will bear witness that which is in the knowledge of God, were ye to know! To this will bear witness the tongue of God, were ye to comprehend! By God, had we to remove the veil, ye would be smitten.

Beware not to contend with God and His commands - Verily it hath appeared in such wise that hath encompassed all that was and is.

Should we speak of this station by the tongue of the people of the kingdom, we would say, "God hath created that maktab before the creation of heaven and earth, and we have entered it before the Kaf was attached to the Noon" (Kaf and Noon are two Arabic letters which, when united form the word kounn which means, Be; that is, before He said, Be, it was). This is that which was uttered by the tongue of my servants, in my kingdom.

Ponder on that which was uttered by the tongue of the people of My might, on the signs which were given to them on My part; on that which was hidden in the knowledge of God; and on that which was uttered by the tongue of greatness and might and of His extolled station.

This is not a Cause which may be made a plaything for your idle fancies, nor is it a field for the foolish and faint of heart. By God, this is the arena of insight and detachment, of vision and upliftment, where none may spur on their chargers save the valiant horsemen of the Merciful, who have severed all attachment to the world of being. These, truly, are they that render God victorious on earth, and are the dawning-places of His sovereign might amidst mankind.

#### 179

Beware lest aught that hath been revealed in the Bayán should keep you from your Lord, the Most Compassionate. God is My witness that the Bayán was sent down for no other purpose than to celebrate My praise, did ye but know! In it the pure in heart will find only the fragrance of My love, only My Name that overshadoweth all that seeth and is seen. Say: Turn ye, O people, unto that which hath proceeded from My Most Exalted Pen. Should ye inhale therefrom the fragrance of God, set not yourselves against Him, nor deny yourselves a portion of His gracious favour and His manifold bestowals. Thus doth your Lord admonish you; He, verily, is the Counsellor, the Omniscient.

#### 180

Whatsoever ye understand not in the Bayán, ask it of God, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers. Should He so desire, He will expound for you that which is revealed therein, and disclose to you the pearls of Divine knowledge and wisdom that lie concealed within the ocean of its words. He, verily, is supreme over all names; no God is there but Him, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. | \[no break\] This is not a matter to play on with the imaginations, nor a place into which will enter the frightened cowards; rather, By God, it is the battlefield of revelation and devotion, and the race-course of beholding and exaltation, wherein none will move about except the knights of the Merciful, who have renounced the worldly things. They are indeed the assistants of God on the earth, and the dawning-places of might amongst the people of the world. Beware lest that which was revealed in the Beyan (of the Bab) withold you from your Lord, the Merciful. By God it hath caused to descend for my praise, were ye to know! The sincere will not find in the Beyan save the fragrance of My love, and that of My name, which is the protector against both the witness and the witnessed.

Say! O people, turn unto that which was caused to descend from my supreme pen - should ye find therein the perfume of God, do not oppose Him, and deprive not yourselves from the bounty of God and His favors; thus doth God admonish you. Verily He is the admonisher, the knower.

Ask God, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers of that which ye do not understand of the Beyan. Verily if He will, He can disclose unto you what is revealed therein and that which is hidden of the pearls of science and wisdom in the sea of its words. Verily He is the protector of the names, and there is no God but He, the Guardian, the self-existent.

The world's equilibrium hath been upset through the vibrating influence of this most great, this new World Order. Mankind's ordered life hath been revolutionized through the agency of this unique, this wondrous System — the like of which mortal eyes have never witnessed.

#### 182

Immerse yourselves in the ocean of My words, that ye may unravel its secrets, and discover all the pearls of wisdom that lie hid in its depths. Take heed that ye do not vacillate in your determination to embrace the truth of this Cause — a Cause through which the potentialities of the might of God have been revealed, and His sovereignty established. With faces beaming with joy, hasten ye unto Him. This is the changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in the future. Let him that seeketh, attain it; and as to him that hath refused to seek it — verily, God is Self-Sufficient, above any need of His creatures.

#### 183

Say: This is the infallible Balance which the Hand of God is holding, in which all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth are weighed, and their fate determined, if ye be of them that believe and recognize this truth. Say: This is the Most Great Testimony, by which the validity of every proof throughout the ages hath been established, would that ye might be assured thereof. Say: Through it the poor have been enriched, the learned enlightened, and the seekers enabled to ascend unto the presence of God. Beware lest ye make it a cause of dissension amongst you. Be ye as firmly settled as the immovable mountain in the Cause of your Lord, the Mighty, the Loving. | \[no break\] The order of affairs has been disturbed through this most great one, and classification has been altered by this incomparable one, the like of which the eye of creation has never seen.

Immerse yourselves in the sea of My utterance that you may be acquainted with what is therein of the pearls of wisdom and mysteries. Beware not to delay your coming to this cause whereby the authority of God and His might became manifest. Hasten unto it with pure faces. This is the religion of God from the beginning until the end. He who desires, let him come, and he who desires not, verily, God is independent of all people of the worlds.

Say! This is indeed the balance of guidance to whosoever is in heaven and upon the earth, and greatest proof, were ye to know!

Say! By it the poor became rich, the learned gained their knowledge, those wishing to ascend unto God, were borne aloft.

Say! by this balance the proofs of all ages have been confirmed (missions of the messengers of God), were ye to believe.

Beware not to disagree about this balance (book) and be as the solid mountains in the cause of your Lord, the mighty, the loving.

Say: O source of perversion! Abandon thy wilful blindness, and speak forth the truth amidst the people. I swear by God that I have wept for thee to see thee following thy selfish passions and renouncing Him Who fashioned thee and brought thee into being. Call to mind the tender mercy of thy Lord, and remember how We nurtured thee by day and by night for service to the Cause. Fear God, and be thou of the truly repentant. Granted that the people were confused about thy station, is it conceivable that thou thyself art similarly confused? Tremble before thy Lord and recall the days when thou didst stand before Our throne, and didst write down the verses that We dictated unto thee — verses sent down by God, the Omnipotent Protector, the Lord of might and power. Beware lest the fire of thy presumptuousness debar thee from attaining to God's Holy Court. Turn unto Him, and fear not because of thy deeds. He, in truth, forgiveth whomsoever He desireth as a bounty on His part; no God is there but Him, the Ever-Forgiving, the All- Bounteous. We admonish thee solely for the sake of God. Shouldst thou accept this counsel, thou wilt have acted to thine own behoof; and shouldst thou reject it, thy Lord, verily, can well dispense with thee, and with all those who, in manifest delusion, have followed thee. Behold! God hath laid hold on him who led thee astray. Return unto God, humble, submissive and lowly; verily, He will put away from thee thy sins, for thy Lord, of a certainty, is the Forgiving, the Mighty, the All-Merciful.

#### 185

This is the Counsel of God; would that thou mightest heed it! This is the Bounty of God; would that thou mightest receive it! This is the Utterance of God; if only thou wouldst apprehend it! This is the Treasure of God; if only thou couldst understand!

#### 186

This is a Book which hath become the Lamp of the Eternal unto the world, and His straight, undeviating Path amidst the peoples of the earth. Say: This is the Dayspring of Divine knowledge, if ye be of them that understand, and the Dawning-place of God's commandments, if ye be of those who comprehend. | Say! O source of perversion (Subhe Ezel)! Cease closing thine eyes, then confess the truth among mankind. By God, my tears have flowed over my cheeks for that I beheld thee advancing towards thy lust and turning aside from Him who created and fashioned thee.

Remember the favor of thy Master, when we brought thee up during nights and days, for the service of the religion. Fear God and be of those who repent. Grant that thine affair is doubtful unto man, is it before the throne, and didst write what we conveyed unto thee of the signs of God, the guardian, the mighty, the powerful.

Beware lest jealousy withold thee from the shore of unity. Turn unto Him, and fear not because of thy deeds. verily, He pardoneth whom He pleaseth by a favor on His part; there is no God but Me, the forgiving, the generous.

Verily, we advised thee for the sake of God. If thou advancest it is for thyself and if thou turnest aside, verily thy Lord is independent of thee and of those who follow thee in manifest error.

Goth hath taken away him who then led thee astray - return unto Him, humble, abased, trembling. Verily He will put away from thee, thy sins. Verily thy Lord is swift to relent. He is the precious, the merciful. This is the sincere advice of God, wert thou of those who hear; this is the bounty of God, wert thou of those who perceive; this is the treasure of God, wert thou of those who know; this is the book which hath become the lamp of the ancient to the world and His straightened path amidst the creatures.

Say! Verily, it is the day-spring of the knowledge of God, were ye to know, and the dawning- place of the ordinances of God, were ye to understand.

Burden not an animal with more than it can bear. We, truly, have prohibited such treatment through a most binding interdiction in the Book. Be ye the embodiments of justice and fairness amidst all creation.

#### 188

Should anyone unintentionally take another's life, it is incumbent upon him to render to the family of the deceased an indemnity of one hundred mithqals of gold. Observe ye that which hath been enjoined upon you in this Tablet, and be not of those who overstep its limits.

#### 189

O members of parliaments throughout the world! Select ye a single language for the use of all on earth, and adopt ye likewise a common script. God, verily, maketh plain for you that which shall profit you and enable you to be independent of others. He, of a truth, is the Most Bountiful, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. This will be the cause of unity, could ye but comprehend it, and the greatest instrument for promoting harmony and civilization, would that ye might understand! We have appointed two signs for the coming of age of the human race: the first, which is the most firm foundation, We have set down in other of Our Tablets, while the second hath been revealed in this wondrous Book.

#### 190

It hath been forbidden you to smoke opium. We, truly, have prohibited this practice through a most binding interdiction in the Book. Should anyone partake thereof, assuredly he is not of Me. Fear God, O ye endued with understanding! | Do not overload the beasts of burden - Verily it is strictly prohibited in the book. Be the manifestation of justice and equity betwixt the earth and heaven. He who commits accidental homicide must pay a compensation of one hundred mithkal of gold to the relations of the deceased. Conform to that whereunto ye are commanded in the tablet and be not of the trespassers.  
  
O people of authority throughout countries! Select one language and one character of those which exist, for all people of the earth. |
