> **Abstract:** During the two years when Bahá'u'lláh lived in isolation in Kurdistan, He composed a number of poems, in which He gave vent to the mighty emotions aroused in His great heart by the mystical experiences He had while confined in the Síyáh-Chál. One of those poems, _Mastand Bulbulán zin Naghmiy-i yá Húy-i-ú,_ "Nightingales are inebriated by the melody of His enrapturing Call," is the subject of this paper, which is an attempt to explain the metaphors and images that embellish this jewel, in the light of both later Writings by Bahá'u'lláh and the Persian literary tradition, in whose style the poem has been written.

     The Inebriation of His Enrapturing Call

(mast-and bulbulán)1

Julio Savi
He is the Glorious

Nightingales are inebriated by the melody of His enrapturing
Call,3 [8.1]

And spirit lovers by one draught of His enrapturing Call.

In a fit of ecstasy, souls conjoin with the Adored One,

As soon as they hear a cry of His enrapturing Call.

Spirit lovers fly away to the remote Tree of Love,

If they are assisted by the melody of His enrapturing Call.

The world of Being is intoxicated as a lover by beauty,

> If the Cup-bearer hands round the wine of His enrapturing
> Call.

The Moses of Spirit faints on the Mystic Mount, [8.5]

If the Sinai is lit with the spark of His enrapturing Call.
312                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

The Sinai of the heart shines and the soul dances,

If the earth echoes with a warbling of His enrapturing Call.

Any shade of strangeness disappears from the pages of the
world,

If a breeze wafts from the locks of His enrapturing Call.

As He arises, you see the lovers resurrected, and hear

Sarafiel’s trumpet from the blow of His enrapturing Call.

Spirit lovers fly towards the Heavenly Throne, and beyond it,

> When they are drawn to love in their ecstasy of His
> enrapturing Call.

Lovers eagerly forfeit their lives, if in the world [8.10]

The splendour is unveiled of His enrapturing Call.

The breeze of eternity wafts in this Day from the mortal
kingdom,

> ‘Cause a fragrant scent breathes from the musk of His
> enrapturing Call.

The Maids in the glorious chambers go into raptures,

If they hear the melody of His enrapturing Call.

New designs are drawn in the world of water and clay,

If from the East the features arise of His enrapturing Call.

The earthly world and the holy and glorious bowers catch fire,

If heaven resounds with a sigh of His enrapturing Call.
Nightingales Are Inebriated                                    313

Mortal ears forget what they heard in the world, [8.15]

If they just enter the circle of His enrapturing Call.

Life comes to naught, nothingness takes on eternity’s hues,

> If the things unseen emerge from the veil of His enrapturing
> Call.

Craving hearts vanish into utter self-effacement,

> If they catch one glimpse of the flame of His enrapturing
> Call.

How could have the Messiah crossed the heavenly vault,

> Shouldn’t He have been guided by the roar of His
> enrapturing Call?

Besides Him, no one could set his foot into the world of being,

So earnest is the watcher of His enrapturing Call.

No mortal eye could see any hue of existence, O son, [8.20]

> If, for an instant, the eye would close of His enrapturing
> Call.

O thirsty ones, plunge into the holy, and sanctified waters,

As the fountain is flowing of His enrapturing Call.

O Dervish, stop setting the fire of meanings to the world:

His enrapturing Call is entangled with His enrapturing Call.

Mast-and bulbulán is a 22 distiches poem composed by
Bahá’u’lláh, whose radíf is yá Húy-i-ú. While commenting upon
the use of radíf in Rúmí’s Díván, Johann Christoph Bürgel, an
expert in literatures of the Middle East, writes:

> in Rúmí’s ghazals the radíf is not a mere ornament, and
> also not just a formal factor that imparts unity to the
> poem, but a strong vehicle of meaning which intensifies
> the message and the symbolism. (“Speech is a ship” 50)

These words also apply to this poem by Bahá’u’lláh in which
the radíf, yá Húy-i-ú, His Yá Hú, translated “His enrapturing
Call,” does not meet only formal exigencies, but is a kind of
basso ostinato that reproduces, in its sound and meaning, the
ecstatic atmospheres of the meetings of Sufi brotherhoods.
During those meetings the Sufis perform two rites that
sometimes carry them to parasensory experiences: dhikr and
samá‘.

Dhikr, recollection or mention of God, is a particular, very
often repetitive, form of prayer. At the time of his initiation,
each aspirant Sufi is taught by his master a particular formula,
sometimes the Shahádá (there is no other god but God),
sometimes the Tasbí˙ (subhána’lláh, Glory to God), sometimes
one of the so called ninety-nine “Names Most beautiful (al-
asmá’u’l-˙usná)” of God, sometimes the invocation yá Hú.
Usually these formulas are repeated according to certain
techniques: choral chanting, certain gestures and movements,
and particular respiratory techniques, all of them instruments
through which Sufis aim at obtaining particular states of
consciousness which they define as ecstatic. The German
Orientalist Annemarie Schimmel (1922–2003) writes about the
dhikr:

> The dhikr could be loud or silent; the loud one is
> generally used in the meetings of Sufi brotherhoods and
Nightingales Are Inebriated                                     315

> ends in the repetition of the last h of Alláh after every
> other sound has slowly disappeared; this last stage
> resembles a deep sigh. The silent dhikr too has been
> described as a journey through the letters of the word
> Alláh until the meditating person is, so to speak,
> surrounded by the luminous circle of this final h, the
> greatest proximity that one could hope to reach.

(Deciphering 148)

Bahá’u’lláh calls dhikr His Law˙-i-Halih-Halih-Halih-Yá-
Bishárat.

As to samá‘, the audition, the French ethnomusicologist Jean
During explains that the word samá‘

> generally denotes the hearing of music, the concert, and
> in its particular sense, the Íúfí tradition of spiritual
> concert, in a more or less ritualised form. Samá‘ is then
> considered to be the “nourishment of the soul,” in other
> words, a devotional practice which, according to Íúfí
> authors, can induce intense emotional transports
> (tawádjud), states of grace (a˙wál), of trance or of
> ecstasy (wádj, wudjúd) and even revelations. These
> manifestations are often accompanied by movements,
> physical agitation or dance which are of set form or
> otherwise, individual or collective, of which Persian
> miniatures have left numerous testimonies and of which
> certain forms are still in use. (“Samá‘”)

This is its poetical description by the celebrated Sufi poet
Núr ad-Dín ‘Abdu’r-Ra˙mán Jámí (1414–1492), the last of the
great Persian poets, in a translation by William C. Chittick, the
author of important books on Islamic thought, Sufism, Shi’ism,
and Persian literature:

> Do you know what it is — the sound of lute and rebec?

“You are my sufficiency, You are my all, O loving God!”
316                                                Lights of Irfán vol. 15

The dry and dismal have no taste of sama‘ — otherwise, that

song has seized the world.
Oh that Minstrel! One tune and every atom of being began

to dance.
The ascetic stands on the shore of imagination and fantasy,

the gnostic’s soul is drowned in the sea of Being.
The holy threshold of Love has no form, but in every form It

shows Itself alone.

> It displayed Itself in the clothing of Layla’s beauty,
> It stole patience and ease from Majnún’s heart.
> It tied the veil of Adhra to Its own face,
> It opened the door of heartache on Wamiq’s cheek.4
> In reality, It played love with Itself —
> Wamiq and Majnún are nothing but names.
> Jami saw the reflection of the Cupbearer,
then fell to prostration, a pitcher before the cup. (Diwan 301;

quoted in Chittick, Sufism 79-80)

As to the locution yá Húy-i-ú, His Yá Hú, literally “His ‘O
He!’,” Hú corresponds to the Arabic Huwa. In Sufi literature
the third-person singular pronoun, Huwa, is often used to
denote God in His hidden, unmanifested Essence. It means
Alláh, His Uniqueness ... [It] refers to the spiritual, abstract,
and bodiless entity of Alláh’s divinity and to His Ipseity. It also
symbolizes an advanced degree of ecstatic transport” (Chebel,
Dictionnaire 204). As has been just said, Yá Hú is a common
invocation among the Sufis, who use it as a dhikr in their
ecstatic sessions. Schimmel compares this invocation to the
Hindu Om and writes that

> nobody who has heard the long-drawn-out call Huuu
> (literally “He”) at the end of a dervish ceremony such as
Nightingales Are Inebriated                                       317

> the Mevlevi samá‘ can forget this sound, whose
> vibrations move body and mind equally. Listening to
> such sounds, one understands why “sound” could be
> regarded as Creative Power, and it becomes perfectly
> clear why musical therapy with sacred, baraka-loaded
> sounds was well known in Islamic culture and is still
> practised among certain Sufi groups. (Deciphering 114)

According to Bausani the invocation yá Hú hints at the “Man
of God,” as “the sign of divine unity ... the absolute Reality
concentrated in a single very luminous point, God’s Personality”
(“Nota introduttiva e note” 21). He quotes an ode by Rúmí that
recites:

> My place is the Placeless, my trace is the Traceless;
‘Tis neither body nor soul, for I belong to the soul of the

Beloved.
I have put duality away, I have seen that the two worlds are

one;
> One I seek, One I know, One I see, One I call.
He is the first, He is the last, He is the outward, He is the

inward;
I know none other except “Yá Hú” and “Yá man Hú”

(Nicholson, Selected Poems 127, no.125, vv. 6-8)

In his translation of one of Rúmí’s ghazals Nicholson leaves
this call in the original language “Yá Hú” (Selected Poems 127,
XXXI.8; see also Rúmí, Mystical Poems 64, no.72, v. 8). However, since
the word “yahoo” is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary
“A name invented by Swift in Gulliver’s Travels for an
imaginary race of brutes having the form of men; frequently in
modern use, a person lacking cultivation or sensibility; a
philistine; a lout; a hooligan” (20:687),5 we have preferred to
convey its meaning through the locution “enrapturing call,”
which describes how this call is perceived in the Muslim world.

318                                                 Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Another translation of this locution could be “His call of ‘O
God’.” In this poem by Bahá’u’lláh the locution “His
enrapturing Call (yá-Húy-i-ú)” could denote the announcement
of the revelation of the Beloved, therefore this whole poem
could be a description of the Most Great Spirit and of Its
impact on Bahá’u’lláh and on the world.

Muslim writers often open their writing with an invocation of
God.

> Nightingales are inebriated by the melody of His enrapturing
Call,

And spirit lovers by one draught of His enrapturing Call.

This verse announces the inebriation of the nightingales and the
lovers, the former when they hear the song of the Beloved, the
latter when they quaff His wine. Both motifs seem to denote the
Revelation of the Most Great Spirit. The joy caused by the
announcement of His Revelation is a recurring theme in
Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings. For example He wrote in one of His
Tablets:

> Proclaim unto every longing lover: “Behold, your Well-
> Beloved (Yár) hath come among men!” and to the
> messengers of the Monarch of love impart the tidings:
> “Lo, the Adored One (Nigár) hath appeared arrayed in
> the fullness of His glory!” O lovers of His beauty! Turn

> the anguish of your separation from Him into the joy of
> an everlasting reunion, and let the sweetness of His
> presence dissolve the bitterness of your remoteness from
> His court. (GWB 320, sec. CLI, para.1, Law˙-i-‘Áshiq va Ma‘shúq;
> Muntakhabátí 206)

Ján bi-Jánán mí-rasad bá vajd-u ˙álat dar damí,

Gar bi-gúsh-i-ú rasad9 yik ßay˙iy-i-yá Húy-i-ú.
In a fit of ecstasy, souls conjoin with the Adored One,

As soon as they hear an echo of His enrapturing Call.

This distich introduces the concepts of vajd and ˙álat, two
words that denote ecstasy. As to vajd, it means: “being
transported, in an ecstasy of love; ecstasy, excessive love”
(Steingass 1457). Shaykh Abú Ismá‘íl ‘Abd’Alláh Anßárí (1006–
1088), one of the earliest Persian mystical poets, lists 100
stations in his first work, Sad Maydán (lit. A Hundred Fields),
centred on love for God. He writes about vajd:

> Ecstasy is the eight-ninth field and arises from the field
> of mystical perception. God, the most high, has said,
> “We made their hearts firm when they stood forth and
> said, ‘Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the
> earth.’” (XVIII: 14).

> Ecstasy is a fire which is kindled from striking the stone
> of freewill against the iron of spiritual need. It possesses
> three aspects: an ecstasy of the psyche (nafs), an ecstasy
> of the heart (del), and an ecstasy of the soul (jan).

> The psyche’s ecstasy overpowers the intellect, puts
> patience to flight, and reveals the invisible. This ecstasy
> is spiritual (ma‘nawi) in nature.
320                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> The heart’s ecstasy, however, puts such a strain on one’s
> endurance that one is driven to move, to cry out and
> rend one’s clothes. This ecstasy is also spiritual in
> nature.

> But the ecstasy which befalls the soul, (jan) bestows
> delight in the vision of God, drowns the psyche (nafs) in
> Truth-Reality, and beckons the soul towards severance
> from the body. One who experiences this ecstasy is the
> object of God’s regard. (Íad Maydán 428-29, quoted in
> Nurbakhsh 1:185)

Bahá’u’lláh mentions “a fit of ecstasy (vajd-u ˙álat)” (v.2)
and writes that “the Maids (Óúryán) ... go into raptures (vajd), |
If they hear the melody of His enrapturing Call” (v.12).

As to ˙álat, it means “state, quality, condition ... one of the
stages of the mystical progress of the Súfis, ecstasy” (Steingass
409). In the Sufi world ˙ál, another form of the word ˙álat, is
defined as follows:

> Literally, state [˙ál] denotes the end of the past and the
> beginning of the future. From the point of view of the
> people of God, however, it is a spiritual reality that
> occurs to the heart without the hearts claiming to
> possess it or seeking to acquire it, whether it be rapture,
> sorrow, contraction, expansion or awe. With the re-
> emergence of the attributes of the nafs it disappears,
> whether to be followed by another state similar to it or
> not. Whenever it lasts, becoming permanent, it is known
> as a station. States are gifts, while stations are acquired.
> The former comes from the wellspring of God’s
> Generosity, while the latter are attained through effort
> and spiritual striving (mojáhada). (Nurbakhsh 8:84-5)

This poem by Bahá’u’lláh is an ecstatic poem, the fruit of the
ecstatic experiences He had in Teheran. It is filled with this
mystical condition.

This distich seemingly announces the reunion of the soul with
the Beloved, when the Beloved sings Yá Hú, that is reveals
Himself through “His enrapturing Call.” This reunion can be
seen at least in two perspectives. The first is the reunion of the
Manifestation of God with the Most Great Spirit. This concept
has been described by Bahá’u’lláh through a Muslim Tradition:

> Arise, O Mu˙ammad, for lo, the Lover (Óabíb) and the
> Beloved (Ma˙búb) are joined together and made one in
> Thee. (GWB 64, sec. XXVII, para.4; Muntakhabátí 51)

The second aspect is the reunion of all the souls with the soul
of the Manifestation of God. This concept is described by
Bahá’u’lláh in the following words:

> Hear Me, ye mortal birds! In the Rose Garden of
> changeless splendor a Flower hath begun to bloom,
> compared to which every other flower is but a thorn,
> and before the brightness of Whose glory the very
> essence of beauty must pale and wither. Arise, therefore,
> and, with the whole enthusiasm of your hearts, with all
> the eagerness of your souls, the full fervor of your will,
> and the concentrated efforts of your entire being, strive
> to attain the paradise of His presence, and endeavor to
> inhale the fragrance of the incorruptible Flower, to
> breathe the sweet savors of holiness, and to obtain a
> portion of this perfume of celestial glory. Whoso
> followeth this counsel will break his chains asunder, will
> taste the abandonment of enraptured love, will attain
> unto his heart’s desire, and will surrender his soul into
> the hands of his Beloved. Bursting through his cage, he
> will, even as the bird of the spirit, wing his flight to his
> holy and everlasting nest. (GWB 320-1, sec. CLI, para.3, Law˙-
> i-‘Áshiq va Ma‘shúq)

8.3

Ján-i-‘áshiq bar-parad tá Sidriy-i-Aqßáy-i-‘Ishq,

Gar madadkár-ash buvad yik naghmiy-i-yá Húy-i-ú.
Spirit lovers fly away to the remote Tree of Love,

If they are assisted by the melody of His enrapturing Call.

The first hemistich mentions “the remote Tree of Love (Sidriy-i-
Aqßáy-i-‘Ishq).” Bahá’u’lláh uses the term sidrih with two
different acceptations. In other poems it is a reference to the
Burning Bush from which Moses heard God’s voice calling Him
and announcing His Prophetic mission. However, Sidrih also is
a Koranic term, used in the locution “the Sidrah-tree, which
marks the boundary (al-Muntahá)” (53:14). This tree “could
represent the boundary which human knowledge cannot surpass,
marked by a mysterious Lote-tree” (Bausani, “Introduzione e
commento” 667n14-15). Persian mystic poets use the following
locutions: “sidratuʼl-muntahá, sidraʼit †úbá, A lote-tree in
Paradise; the heavenly mansion of the angel Gabriel; — †áʼiri
sidra, The bird of the heavenly lote-tree, i.e. Gabriel” (Steingass
663). Therefore this word could also denote the Sadratu’l-
Muntahá, a term that “is often used in the Bahá’í Writings to
designate the Manifestation of God Himself” (“Preface and Notes”
220n128) and “to designate Bahá’u’lláh” (ibid. 220n164). It is the
station of the Manifestation of God. Therefore this distich
could hint at Bahá’u’lláh accepting His Prophethood, when the
Most Great Spirit sings Yá Hú, that is reveals Itself to Him
through “His enrapturing Call.”

8.4

Mast gardad ‘álam-i-Hastí, chih10 ‘áshiq az jamál,

Gar bi-dawr uftad zi Sáqí bádiy-í yá Húy-i-ú.

> The world of Being is intoxicated as a lover by beauty,

> If the Cup-bearer hands round the wine of His enrapturing

The Cup-bearer seems to be the Manifestation of God, the wine
of His enrapturing Call seems to be Its Revelation. When the
Most Great Spirit reveals Itself, through His Manifestation, the
world of being is filled with joy. This hemistich is reminiscent
of the Tablet of Carmel:

> Seized with transports of joy, and raising high her voice,
> she [Mount Carmel] thus exclaimed: “May my life be a
> sacrifice to Thee, inasmuch as Thou hast fixed Thy gaze
> upon me, hast bestowed upon me Thy bounty, and hast
> directed towards me Thy steps. Separation from Thee, O
> Thou Source of everlasting life, hath well nigh consumed
> me, and my remoteness from Thy presence hath burned
> away my soul. All praise be to Thee for having enabled
> me to hearken to Thy call, for having honored me with
> Thy footsteps, and for having quickened my soul
> through the vitalizing fragrance of Thy Day and the
> shrilling voice of Thy Pen, a voice Thou didst ordain as
> Thy trumpet-call amidst Thy people. And when the hour
> at which Thy resistless Faith was to be made manifest did
> strike, Thou didst breathe a breath of Thy spirit into Thy
> Pen, and lo, the entire creation shook to its very
> foundations, unveiling to mankind such mysteries as lay
> hidden within the treasuries of Him Who is the Possessor
> of all created things.” (TB 3, para.2, Law˙-i-Karmil)

8.5

Músíy-i-Ján munßa‘iq dar ˇúr-i-Ma‘ní uftad,11

Gar bar afrúzad bi-Síná jadhviy-i-yá Húy-i-ú.
The Moses of Spirit faints on the Mystic Mount,

If the Sinai is lit with the spark of His enrapturing Call.
324                                                 Lights of Irfán vol. 15

In this verse Bahá’u’lláh refers to Moses through the image of
Mount Sinai, and uses the words ˇúr, “A mountain, especially
mount Sinai” (Steingass 821) and Síná, “Mount Sina” (Steingass 718).
The image used in this verse is drawn from the story of Moses as
narrated in the Koran. When God revealed Himself to Moses on
Mount Sinai, He swooned, that is He became annihilated.
Lambden remarks:

> Celebrating       the      spiritually intoxicating   and
> eschatological consequences of the Divine Beloved’s
> rhythmic chant “O He!” (yá hú), Bahá’u’lláh ... associates
> the burning of the “firebrand” (jadhwa) of this
> invocation on Sinai with the “Moses of the soul” (músáy-
> i ján) falling into a swoon on the “Mystic Mount” (†úr-i
> ma’aní). (“Sinaitic Mysteries” 116-7)

It seems a reference to the “‘Sinai’ of Moses’ ‘bosom’ (or
interior self)” (Lambden, “Sinaitic Mysteries” 5:109-10, cf. Koran 27:12),
purified by the quickening influence of the Beloved. And thus
this distich seemingly hints at the annihilation of the human
qualities of Bahá’u’lláh in front of the Most Great Spirit, when
He received the Intimation of His Divine Mission.

As to the word spark (jadhvih), it seems to denote an
emanation of Spirit. Also Western mystics used the term spark
to denote a spiritual reality. For example the German
Dominican preacher, theologian and mystic Meister Johannes
Eckhart (ca. 1260–1327) calls the inner self “scintilla animae (the
spark of the soul).” He wrote:

> I have occasionally said that there is a power in the spirit
> that alone is free. Occasionally, I’ve said that there is a
> shelter of the spirit. Occasionally, I’ve said there is a
> light of the spirit. Occasionally, I’ve said there is a little
> spark. Now, however, I say it is neither this nor that. All
> the same, it is a something, which is more elevated above
> this and that than heaven is over earth. For this reason I
> name it now in a more noble way than I have ever named

> it in the past ... It is free of all names and bare of all
> forms, totally free and void just as God is void and free
> in himself. It is totally one and simple, just as God is one
> and simple, so that we can in no manner gaze into it ...
> For the Father really lives in this power, and the Spirit
> gives rise along with the Father to the same only
> begotten Son. (Passion for Creation 277)

8.6

ˇúr-i-dil gardad munír-u ján bi-raqß áyad hamí,

Gar dar-uftad dar já˙án yik ghunniy-i-yá Húy-i-ú.
The Sinai of the heart shines and the soul dances,

> If the earth echoes with the warbling of His enrapturing

The image of the Sinai is also used in this distich, which seems
to describe the light and the joy brought by the new Revelation.
Bahá’u’lláh adopts the locution “the Sinai of the heart (ˇúr-i-
dil)” in other Writings as well:

> The light hath shone on thee from the horizon of the
> sacred Mount and the spirit of enlightenment hath
> breathed in the Sinai (síná’) of thy heart (qalb). (Arabic
> Hidden Words, no.63; Al-Kalimátu’l-Maknúnat 29)

> Verily, I say, so fierce is the blaze of the Bush of love,
> burning in the Sinai of the heart (sínáy-i-˙ubb), that the
> streaming waters of holy utterance can never quench its
> flame. (KI 61, para.65, KMI47)

As has been said, both the two words ˇúr and Síná denote
Mount Sinai. As to the sentence “the soul dances,” the place of
dance in mystic writings is variously explained. Javad
Nurbakhsh (1926–2008), the master of the Ni’matu’lláhi Sufi

326                                                 Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Order from 1953, a psychiatrist and a prolific writer, explains
that dance is “rapture of the spirit” (1:179). He also writes:

> Abo’l-Hasan Kharaqani12 said, “Dancing is the activity
> of one who, as he stamps his feet on the ground, sees
> through the earth, and as he flings up his hands, beholds
> the divine throne. All dancing besides this is
> disrespectful to the character of Bâyazid Bastâmi,
> Jonaid, and Shebli.”13 (1:180)

Óáfiẓ writes:

He writes moreover:

Dance as an expression of spiritual joy is not foreign to
Western tradition. Titus Burckhardt (1908–1984), the Swiss
master of the spiritualist tradition, writes:

> A Psalm in the Bible says: “Let them praise His Name in

One remembers the story of David:

Ma˙v gardad rang-i-ghayríyyat zi ßaf˙iy-i-rúzgar,

Gar nasímí bar-vazad az ja‘diy-i-yá Húy-i-ú.

> Any shade of strangeness disappears from the pages of the
world,

If a breeze wafts from the locks of His enrapturing Call.

This distich uses the image of the perfume exhaling from a
scented lock to describe the disappearance of “otherness
(ghayríyat)” from the world.

The word ghayríyat, “Change, alteration; strangeness,
unreality; jealousy” (Steingass 901), means in theological contexts
to be ghayr, and ghayr in its turn means “other, different”
(Steingass 900), that is different from God or unrelated to God.
Toshihiko Izutzu (1914–1993), a leading figure in the fields of

328                                             Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Islamic, Far Eastern and comparative philosophy, explained that
in “the ordinary empirical state”

> things are separated and distinguished first from each
> other, and then from the Absolute. In this dimension
> man normally sees only the phenomenal world, and
> considers the Absolute — if man at all becomes aware of
> the existence of something beyond the phenomenal
> world — as the entirely “other” (ghayr). (Creation 54)

However, he adds, in the state of unification called by the Sufis
baqá’ or jam‘,

> all the separate things are seen reduced to their original
> existential unity. All things, beginning with the self-
> consciousness of the mystic, disappear from awareness.
> The light of the phenomenal world is extinguished. There
> remains only absolute unity. There is not even the
> consciousness of the unity, for there is no trace here of
> any consciousness. The whole universe is unity. And the
> unity is light, but at the same time it is the darkness of
> the phenomenal world. (ibid.)

It is the mystic unitive ecstasy that Sufis believed to be
accessible to the great mystics.

Bahá’u’lláh seems to explain the concepts of alterity and
unification in a different way. He relates these concepts with a
verse of the Koran saying:

> All on the earth shall pass away, But the face (wajh) of
> thy Lord shall abide resplendent with majesty and glory.

(55:26-7, Rodwell)

He writes:

> Canst thou discover any one but Me (ghayrí), O Pen, in
> this Day? What hath become of the creation and the
> manifestations thereof? What of the names and their

> kingdom? Whither are gone all created things, whether
> seen or unseen? What of the hidden secrets of the
> universe and its revelations? Lo, the entire creation hath
> passed away! Nothing remaineth except My Face (wajhí),
> the Ever-Abiding, the Resplendent, the All-Glorious.

(GWB 29, sec. XIV, para.4, Law˙-i-Ri∂ván; Muntakhabátí 28)

He adds elsewhere:

> I know not how long they shall spur on the charger of
> self and passion and rove in the wilderness of error and
> negligence! Shall either the pomp of the mighty or the
> wretchedness of the abased endure? Shall he who
> reposeth upon the loftiest seat of honour, who hath
> attained the pinnacle of might and glory, abide forever?
> Nay, by My Lord, the All-Merciful! All on earth shall
> pass away, and there remaineth alone the face (wajh) of
> My Lord, the All-Glorious, the Most-Bountiful. (SLH 133,
> sec. 1, para.269, Súriy-i-Haykal: Náßiri’d-Dín Sháh; Áthár 1:86)

This passage seems to convey a concept of alterity as referred
to the Manifestation of God, and not to God Himself. All
human beings are nothing in front of Him, and are expected to
totally surrender to Him, so that nothing of their will should
remain that is not identified with His Will.

Another explanation of the concept of alterity among the
Sufis is given by Chittick:

> “Otherness” is a veil over our eyes woven by our own
> imagination. Neither we ourselves nor the things we
> perceive outside of ourselves are truly other than God.

(Sufi Path of Love 304)

Rúmí writes in this regard:

330                                               Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> Why does poison taste bitter? Why are thorns sharp?

Why does anger display violence? Why are nights dark?

> One day in the garden of His Face I kept wondering how
> in this world, during His reign, a thorn could be a thorn.

> Has that Presence out of jealousy (ghayrat) masked His

> perverted that it can perceive nothing of the Gentleness
> of that Radiant face. (Díván, “Ghazalyát” 2555, v.1-5, quoted
> in Chittick, Sufi Path of Love 307)

Bahá’u’lláh uses the term ghayríyat in the following context:

> Any shade of strangeness (ghayríyat) disappears from the
> pages of the world,

If a breeze wafts from the locks of His enrapturing Call.

This verse seems to convey all the above explained meanings.
When the Beloved becomes manifest in the world, showing His
unique qualities, all veils seem to fall and His lovers become
annihilated in Him. Bahá’u’lláh seems to state in this verse that
when He becomes manifest in the world, everything vanishes,
only His sovereign Word remains. And whoever is willing to
love Him has the possibility of not being deprived of the
bountiful Grace of that Word. This distich may also mean that
the new Revelation has given to all human beings the
opportunity to understand the concept of Divine Unity:

> The essence of belief in Divine unity consisteth in
> regarding Him Who is the Manifestation of God and
> Him Who is the invisible, the inaccessible, the
> unknowable Essence as one and the same. By this is
> meant that whatever pertaineth to the former, all His
> acts and doings, whatever He ordaineth or forbiddeth,
> should be considered, in all their aspects, and under all
> circumstances, and without any reservation, as identical
> with the Will of God Himself. This is the loftiest station
> to which a true believer in the unity of God can ever
> hope to attain. (GWB 166, sec. LXXXIV, para.4)

Finally, since ghayríyat also means “strangeness” (Steingass
901), this sentence could also hint at the spirit of brotherhood,
that is the contrary of “strangeness,” amongst human beings
brought by the new Revelation.

8.8

As He arises, you see the lovers resurrected, and hear

Sarafiel’s trumpet from the blow of His enrapturing Call.

This distich uses the language of eschatology, referring to the
Day of judgment or resurrection through the words
resurrection, qyámat, “The resurrection, last day” (Steingass 997),
Sarafiel’s trumpet, Íúr, “A trumpet, clarion, horn; the trumpet
of Isráfíl summoning mankind to resurrection” (Steingass 796),
and the word nafkhih, “One blow; [nafkhatuʼl-baʻß, The
trumpet-blast of resurrection; — nafkhaʼi rú˙, The Holy Spirit
which the angel Gabriel blew into the sleeve of Mary according
to Muhammadan belief]” (Steingass 1415), used in the Koran to
refer to the trumpet-blast or horn-blast of resurrection (Koran
6:73, 23:101, 39:68, 69:13, etc.).

332                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 15

Resurrection can be seen in two different perspectives,
personal and eschatological. As to the personal perspective, the
key to read this metaphor is in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán:

> Such things have come to pass in the days of every
> Manifestation of God. Even as Jesus said: “Ye must be
> born again [1 John 3:7].” Again He saith: “Except a man
> be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into
> the Kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is
> flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit [2
> John 3:5-6].” The purport of these words is that
> whosoever in every dispensation is born of the Spirit and
> is quickened by the breath of the Manifestation of
> Holiness, he verily is of those that have attained unto
> “life” and “resurrection (ba‘ath)” and have entered into
> the “paradise” of the love of God. And whosoever is not
> of them, is condemned to “death” and “deprivation,” to
> the “fire” of unbelief, and to the “wrath” of God. In all
> the scriptures, the books and chronicles, the sentence of
> death, of fire, of blindness, of want of understanding
> and hearing, hath been pronounced against those whose
> lips have tasted not the ethereal cup of true knowledge,
> and whose hearts have been deprived of the grace of the
> holy Spirit in their day. Even as it hath been previously
> recorded: “Hearts have they with which they understand
> not [Koran 7:178].” (KI 118-9, para.125; KMI90)

As to the eschatological perspective, Bahá’u’lláh concisely
writes:

> the Day of Resurrection (qyámat) ... is the Day of the
> rise of God Himself through His all-embracing
> Revelation. (KI 143, para.151; KMI111)

According to the Koranic descriptions of the Day of
Judgment or Resurrection, this Day will be announced by the

blast of the trumpet of the Angel Seraphiel (ßúr), the Angel of
death, mentioned in verse 8. The motif of the Koranic horn is
explained by Bahá’u’lláh in His Kitáb-i-ˆqán. He writes,
referring to the Mu˙ammadic Dispensation, that “by ‘trumpet
(ßúr)’ is meant the trumpet-call of Mu˙ammad’s Revelation,
which was sounded in the heart of the universe, and by
‘resurrection’ is meant His own rise to proclaim the Cause of
God” (KI 116, para.123; KMI89). Then He explains that
“resurrection” is the day of the advent of each Manifestation of
God. In this hemistich Bahá’u’lláh may allude to the beginning
of His Own Dispensation.

8.9

Ján-i-‘áshiq bar-parad tá ‘arsh-u zán ham bu-gudharad,

Chún shavad majdhúb-i-‘ishq az jadhbiy-i-yá Húy-i-ú.
Spirit lovers fly towards the Heavenly Throne, and beyond it,

> When they are drawn to love in their ecstasy of His
> enrapturing Call.

This distich describes the lover falling a prisoner of Love
through the revelation of the Most Great Spirit and winging his
flight towards the “Heavenly Throne (‘Arsh).”

In the language of the Sufis the Throne (‘Arsh) is always
associated with Divine power. In the hierarchy of the Divine
worlds typical of Sufism, to which Bahá’u’lláh sometimes
referred (see Savi, Towards the Summit 31-5, 270-88), the throne is
variously interpreted as the world of Háhút, or of Láhút, or of
Jabarút. The Throne, ‘Arsh, of God is often mentioned in the
Bahá’í Writings, and it usually denotes the sovereignty of God.
As to the “Heavenly Throne (‘Arsh),” mentioned in verse 9, it
could hint at the lofty station of the Manifestation of God. For
further comments upon the concept of throne in the Bahá’í
Writings, see Savi, Towards the Summit 88-9 and 1.14.

In the light of what has been said, this distich seems to
explain in poetical terms that the Manifestation of God reaches
the apex of the heavenly hierarchy because of His deep love for
the Most Great Spirit.

8.10

Dast bar-dárad zi ján jánán bi-jahd,14

Gar futad dar mulk-i-hastí jilviy-i-yá Húy-i-ú.
Lovers eagerly forfeit their lives, if in the world

The splendour is unveiled of His enrapturing Call.

When the Most Great Spirit reveals Itself, the Manifestation of
God, and with Him all the lovers of God, lay down their all,
even their life. Bahá’u’lláh has exposed this concept in many
passages. For example He wrote:

> Every moment of my life my head crieth out to Thee and
> saith: “Would, O my Lord, that I could be raised on the
> spear-point in Thy path!” while my blood entreateth
> Thee saying: “Dye the earth with me, O my God, for the
> sake of Thy love and Thy pleasure!” Thou knowest that I
> have, at no time, sought to guard my body against any
> affliction, nay rather I have continually anticipated the
> things Thou didst ordain for me in the Tablet of Thy
> decree. (PM 106, sec. 66, para.7)

> By God! Mine head yearneth for the spear out of love
> for its Lord. I never passed a tree, but Mine heart
> addressed it saying: “O would that thou wert cut down
> in My name, and My body crucified upon thee, in the
> path of My Lord!,” for I see the people wandering
> distraught and unconscious in their drunken stupor. (SLH
> 132, sec. 1, para.266, Súriy-i-Haykal: Náßiri’d-Dín Sháh)

8.11

Bád-i-báqí bar-vazad az mulk-i-fání ín Zamán,

Chún vazídih búy-i-mishg az náfiy-i-yá Húy-i-ú.

> The breeze of eternity wafts in this Day from the mortal
kingdom,

> ‘Cause a fragrant scent breathes from the musk of His
> enrapturing Call.

The stage of annihilation (faná’) implies a denial and
subjugation of all one’s personal attributes, a goal that seekers
must reach, if they want to attain their subsistence in God
(baqá’), that is, the affirmation and acquisition of the divine
qualities. The term fáná’ denotes among the Sufis “extinction of
individual limitation in the state of Union with God” (Burckhardt,
Introduction 116). It means the abandonment of personal
attributes, required so that subsistence in God, baqá’, that is,
the acquisition of the divine qualities, may be attained. Fání is
“(in the parlance of the Súfís) one who has reached the state of
faná’, or annihilation” (Steingass 905). In the Bahá’í Writings this
term seems to denote a person who increasingly subordinates his
animal nature to his spiritual nature, through his submission to
the will of God as voiced by His Manifestation (see Savi, Towards
the Summit 366-7). The locution “mortal kingdom (mulk-i-fání)”
seems to describe not only the human world, but also that
human condition whereby the flesh keeps longer and longer
silence, that condition which Sufis call faná’.

These verses allude to the victory over the self that love
requires.

The locution “in this Day (ín Zamán)” is not a mere temporal
indication, it may also refer to the Day of God (Yawm-i-Khudá),
which Bahá’u’lláh calls both with the Persian-Arabic words
zamán and yawm. Bahá’u’lláh explains its meaning in the Kitáb-
i-Aqdas:

336                                                      Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> This is the Day of God (Yawm Alláh), the Day on which
> naught shall be mentioned save His own Self, the
> omnipotent Protector of all worlds. (KA80, para.167; Arabic
> 160)

He also explains it in the Súriy-i-Haykal:

> the Day of God (Yawm Alláh) is none other but His own
> Self, Who hath appeared with the power of truth (SLH,
> Súriy-i-Haykal 27, sec. 1, para. 63; Áthár 1:20)

The Day of God (Yawm-i-Khudá), one of the leitmotivs of
Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings, is extensively described by Bahá’u’lláh as
a Day

> [that] eclipseth all other created Days (SLH 80, 1, para.154,
> Súriy-i-Haykal: Napoleon III),

> which the Pen of the Most High hath glorified in all the
> holy Scriptures (GWB 13, sec. X, para.2);

> [alluded to] in all the sacred Scriptures15 (GWB 11, sec. VII,
> para.2, Law˙-i-Karmil);

> which God hath announced through the tongue of His
> Apostle [Mu˙ammad] (ESW 101);

> the purpose underlying all creation ... the Day which all
> the Prophets, and the Chosen Ones, and the holy ones,
> have wished to witness (Quoted in Shoghi Effendi, ADJ 77);

> [for which] the soul of every Prophet of God, of every
> Divine Messenger, hath thirsted ... All the divers
> kindreds of the earth have, likewise, yearned to attain
> (GWB 10, sec. VII, para.2, Súriy-i-Qamíß),

> [when] He, the Ancient of everlasting days is come,
> girded with majesty and power (GWB 36, sec. XV, para.1);

> of God Himself ... [when] the Lord alone shall be exalted
> (GWB 13, sec. X, para.2);

> on which naught shall be mentioned save His own Self,
> the omnipotent Protector of all worlds (KA 80, para.167);

> which God hath exalted above all other days, and
> whereon the All-Merciful hath shed the splendor of His
> effulgent glory upon all who are in heaven and all who
> are on earth (SLH 68, par. 133, Lawh-i-Haykal: Napoleon III);

> in which God’s most excellent favors have been poured
> out upon men, the Day in which His most mighty grace
> hath been infused into all created things (Quoted in Shoghi
> Effendi, ADJ 77);

> in which the fragrances of mercy have been wafted over
> all created things, a Day so blest that past ages and
> centuries can never hope to rival it, a Day in which the
> countenance of the Ancient of Days hath turned towards
> His holy seat (TB 3, Law˙-i-Karmil).

> whereon the Ocean of God’s mercy hath been manifested
> unto men (GWB 7),

> [in which] the potentialities inherent in the station of
> man, the full measure of his destiny on earth, the innate
> excellence of his reality, must all be manifested (GWB 340,
> sec. CLXII, para.1);

> [when] “God will satisfy everyone out of His
> abundance” (TB 67, Kalimát-i-Firdawsíyyih, quoting Koran
> 4:129);

> that God hath ordained to be a blessing unto the
> righteous, a retribution for the wicked, a bounty for the
> faithful and a fury of His wrath for the faithless and the
> forward (TB 103, Ishráqát).
338                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

The Day of God is described by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as the Day when

> the Sun of Reality will arise ... with the utmost warmth
> and splendor (SAQ 57, sec. 11, para.44).

Many passages by Bahá’u’lláh on the greatness of this Day are
quoted by Shoghi Effendi in his Advent (ADJ 77-80).

The “breeze of immortality (bád-i-báqí)” hints not only at the
renewed spirituality brought by the new Revelation, but also at
that condition which Sufis called baqá’ and which has been
described above as “the affirmation and acquisition of the
divine qualities.” The “musky scent (búy-i-mishg)” could
describe the effusion of spiritual bounties bestowed by the new
Revelation. The image of the “musk-pod (náfih),” “A bag or
bladder of musk; the belly, or skin of the belly of any animal”
(Steingass 1376), is commonly used by Sufi poets. Óáfiẓ writes:

> Of the musk (mushk) of Khutan and of musk-pod (náfih)
> of Chín none hath seen

> What, from the fragrant morning breeze (of the east)
> every morning I see. (Díván 671, “Ghazalyát,” no.392, v. 5;
> Divan 370, no.357, v. 6)

Verse 11 could hint at the spiritual transformation that takes
place in all the seekers that inhale the scents of the Revelation
of the Spirit in this new Day of God.

8.12

Bar-vazad bar gúsh-ishán16 yik ranniy-i-yá Húy-i-ú.
The Maids in the glorious chambers go into raptures,

If they hear the melody of His enrapturing Call.

This distich describes, with the typical hyperbolic language
characterizing the Sufi descriptions of the Beloved, the

exultation of the spiritual worlds for the advent of the new
Day. The “Maids (Óúríyán)” in their “glorious chambers
(ghurfiy-i-‘izzat)” are reminiscent of the Tablet of the Holy
Mariner, when it says:

> Whereupon the maid of heaven (Óúríyata’r-Rú˙) looked
> out from her exalted chamber (ghurfáta’l-a‘lá) (BP 224;
> Ma’idih 4:336)

Gar †ulú‘ árad17 zi mashriq vajhiy-i-yá Húy-i-ú.
New designs are drawn in the world of water and clay,

If from the East the features arise of His enrapturing Call.

This distich hints at the renewal of the world brought by the
parousia of the Beloved. It is reminiscent of the following
sentence in one of the Tablets of Ri∂ván:

> Verily, We have caused every soul to expire by virtue of
> Our irresistible and all-subduing sovereignty. We have,
> then, called into being a new creation, as a token of Our
> grace unto men. (GWB 29-30, sec. XIV, para.5, Law˙-i-Ri∂ván)

Bahá’u’lláh writes moreover:

> Through the movement of Our Pen of glory We have, at
> the bidding of the omnipotent Ordainer, breathed a new
> life into every human frame, and instilled into every
> word a fresh potency. All created things proclaim the
> evidences of this world-wide regeneration. (TB 84, Law˙-i-
> Dunyá)

The second hemistich is reminiscent of the following words
written by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

The earthly world and the holy and glorious bowers catch fire,

If heaven resounds with a sigh of His enrapturing Call.

This verse seems to hint at the beneficial effects of the new
Revelation on all the world, even the supernal worlds. The
image of the “holy and glorious bowers (khiyám-i-‘izz-i-quds)”
also is used in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán where it could describe the
spiritual worlds whence the Manifestations of God descend on
earth:

> The significance and essential purpose underlying these
> words is to reveal and demonstrate unto the pure in
> heart and the sanctified in spirit that they Who are the

> KMI107)

8.15

Gúsh-i-‘álam pák gardad zán-chih bi-shníd az jahán,

Gar dar-áyad yik damí dar ˙alqiy-i-yá Húy-i-ú.
Mortal ears forget what they heard in the world,

If they just enter the circle of His enrapturing Call.

This verse seems to hint that the new Revelation implies the
abandonment of whatever had been learnt from the past
culture. The locution “the circle of His enrapturing Call (˙alqiy-
i-yá Húy-i-ú)” is better understood in the light of the Sufi
explanations of the term ˙alqih, which Steingass also defines “an
assembly, circle of friends, fraternity” (Steingass 428):

> The sitting together of the Sufis in an assembly for the
> purpose of the remembrance of God is called a circle.
> The symbolism is that of links in a chain, all joined to
> one another and forged into a single unit. Likewise, the
> hearts of the Sufis in the circle of samâ‘ are so closely
> conjoined that they form a single heart. (Nurbakhsh 1:175)

The wording of this verse resembles what Bahá’u’lláh writes in
the Kitáb-i-ˆqán:

342                                                Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> They that tread the path of faith, they that thirst for the
> wine of certitude, must cleanse themselves of all that is
> earthly — their ears (gúsh) from idle talk ... (KI 3, para. 2;
> KMI2)

This concept is explained in doctrinal terms in the same book:

> As He hath said: “When the heaven shall be cloven
> asunder [Koran 82:1].” By “heaven” is meant the heaven of
> divine Revelation, which is elevated with every
> Manifestation, and rent asunder with every subsequent
> one. By “cloven asunder” is meant that the former
> Dispensation is superseded and annulled. I swear by God!
> That this heaven being cloven asunder is, to the
> discerning, an act mightier than the cleaving of the skies!
> Ponder a while. That a divine Revelation which for years
> hath been securely established; beneath whose shadow all
> who have embraced it have been reared and nurtured; by
> the light of whose law generations of men have been
> disciplined; the excellency of whose word men have
> heard recounted by their fathers; in such wise that
> human eye hath beheld naught but the pervading
> influence of its grace, and mortal ear hath heard naught
> but the resounding majesty of its command — what act
> is mightier than that such a Revelation should, by the
> power of God, be “cloven asunder” and be abolished at
> the appearance of one soul? Reflect, is this a mightier act
> than that which these abject and foolish men have
> imagined the “cleaving of the heaven” to mean? (KI 44-5,
> para. 46)

Shoghi Effendi explained the same concept in the following
words:

> If long-cherished ideals and time-honored institutions, if
> certain social assumptions and religious formulae have
> ceased to promote the welfare of the generality of

> mankind, if they no longer minister to the needs of a
> continually evolving humanity, let them be swept away
> and relegated to the limbo of obsolescent and forgotten
> doctrines. Why should these, in a world subject to the
> immutable law of change and decay, be exempt from the
> deterioration that must needs overtake every human
> institution? For legal standards, political and economic
> theories are solely designed to safeguard the interests of
> humanity as a whole, and not humanity to be crucified
> for the preservation of the integrity of any particular
> law or doctrine. (WOB 42)

8.16

Níst gardad hast-u19 ham rang-i-qidam gardad ‘adam,

Gar bar-áyad Ghayb-há az pardiy-i-yá Húy-i-ú.
Life comes to naught, nothingness takes on eternity’s hues,

> If the things unseen emerge from the veil of His enrapturing

This distich could hint at the reversal of the values brought by
the new Revelation. Bahá’u’lláh refers to this concept in the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas:

> Behold, the “mystery of the Great Reversal in the Sign of
> the Sovereign” hath now been made manifest ... How
> many the outwardly pious who have turned away, and
> how many the wayward who have drawn nigh,
> exclaiming: “All praise be to Thee, O Thou the Desire of
> the worlds!” In truth, it is in the hand of God to give
> what He willeth to whomsoever He willeth, and to
> withhold what He pleaseth from whomsoever He may
> wish. He knoweth the inner secrets of the hearts and the
> meaning hidden in a mocker’s wink. How many an
> embodiment of heedlessness who came unto Us with
> purity of heart have We established upon the seat of
344                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> Our acceptance; and how many an exponent of wisdom
> have We in all justice consigned to the fire. We are, in
> truth, the One to judge. He it is Who is the
> manifestation of “God doeth whatsoever He pleaseth,”
> and abideth upon the throne of “He ordaineth
> whatsoever He chooseth.” (KA 75-6, para.157)

This verse is explained in the “Notes” as follows:

> Bahá’u’lláh in one of His Tablets refers to the “symbol
> and allusion” of the “mystery of the Great Reversal in
> the Sign of the Sovereign.” He states: “Through this
> reversal He hath caused the exalted to be abased and the
> abased to be exalted,” and He recalls that “in the days of
> Jesus, it was those who were distinguished for their
> learning, the men of letters and religion, who denied
> Him, whilst humble fishermen made haste to gain
> admittance into the Kingdom.” (“Preface and Notes”
> 239n171)

8.17

Ma˙v-i-mu†laq gardad án-kash20 árzú’í dar dil21 ast,

Gar bi-bínad yik naẓar án shu‘liy-i-yá Húy-i-ú.
Craving hearts vanish into utter self-effacement,

> If they catch one glimpse of the flame of His enrapturing

The first part of the distich is reminiscent of a distich by
Majdúd Saná’í (ca.1045–ca.1141) quoted by Bahá’u’lláh in the
Four Valleys:

> Never the covetous heart (dil bá árzú) shall come to the
> stealer of hearts,

> Never the shrouded soul unite with beauty’s rose. (FV 60;
> CV152)

When the seeker meets the Beloved, he falls in love and love
“yieldeth no remedy but death, he walketh not save in the valley
of the shadow (vádíy-i-‘adam, literally valley of nothingness)”
(SV10; HV102). Therefore the lover must renounce his “covetous
heart,” that is his own lower self, to mirror forth the divine
attributes of the Beloved.

8.18

Kay tavánistí Masí˙ az gunbad-i-a‘lá gudhasht,

Gar na-búdí rah-bar-ash yik na‘riy-i-yá Húy-i-ú.
How could have the Messiah crossed the heavenly vault,

> Shouldn’t He have been guided by the roar of His
> enrapturing Call?

This distich seemingly hints at the image of Jesus descended
from heaven, in which Jesus says: “For I came down from
heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent
me” (John 6:38, KJV). This reference is also present in other
passages. For example Bahá’u’lláh wrote in His Tablet to Pius
IX: “He, verily, hath again come down from Heaven even as He
came down from it the first time” (SLH 55, sec. 1, para.102, Súriy-i-
Haykal: Pope Pius IX). Jesus came down from heaven, guided by
the revelation of the Most Great Spirit. In another perspective,
it could hint at the image of a Jesus ascended into the Highest
Heaven through His ecstasy.

8.19

Kay tavánad ghayr-i-ú dar mulk-i-hastí pá-nihád,

Zan-kih báshad bas ghayúr án sha˙niy-i-yá Húy-i-ú.

> Besides Him, no one could set his foot into the world of
being,

So earnest is the watcher of His enrapturing Call.
346                                                 Lights of Irfán vol. 15

The concept of the jealousy of God, the central element of this
verse, has been explained while commenting upon verse 7:

> Any colour of strangeness (ghayríyyat) disappears from
> the pages of the world,

> If a breeze wafts, exhaling the perfume of the lock of His

Sha˙nih means “A viceroy, vicegerent, representative,
lieutenant; head of the police; a prefect; a mayor, provost; an
ambassador; a peon or servant of a tax-gatherer” (Steingass 736)
and Henri Wilberforce-Clarke (1840-1905), an officer in the
British India corps, first translator of the Bústán of Sa’dí and of
the Sikandar Námih by Nízamí, translated it as “watchman”
(Óáfiẓ, Díván 158, “Ghazalyát,” no.64, v.10; Divan 54, “Ghazalyát,” no.47,
v.8). Therefore this verse could denote that the Most Great
Spirit — “the watchman of His enrapturing Call (sha˙niy-i-yá
Húy-i-ú)” — reveals the Oneness of God in the world of
Existence through the Manifestation of God, “He ... in Whose
name the standard of Divine Unity hath been planted upon the
Sinai of the visible and invisible worlds, proclaiming that there
is none other God but Me, the Peerless, the Glorious, the
Incomparable” (SLH 49, sec. 1, para.93, Súriy-i-Haykal). And thus the
Manifestation of God is the only One Who sets “his foot in the
world of being,” going beyond the barrier of otherness or
alterity (ghayríyyat).

8.20

Rang-i-hastí-rá na-bínad chashm-i-imkán, ay pisar,

Gar ravad bar ham damí án dídiy-i-yá Húy-i-ú.
No mortal eye could see any hue of existence, O son,

> If, for an instant, the eye would close of His enrapturing

This verse could hint that existence is kept in life by the Most
Great Spirit. Without it nothing would exist. This concept is
exposed by Bahá’u’lláh in the following words:

> There can be no doubt whatever that if for one moment
> the tide of His mercy and grace were to be withheld
> from the world, it would completely perish. (GWB 68, sec.

XXVII, para.6)

> Consider, for instance, the revelation of the light of the
> Name of God, the Educator. Behold, how in all things
> the evidences of such a revelation are manifest, how the
> betterment of all beings dependeth upon it ... Were this
> revelation to be withdrawn, all would perish. (GWB 189-
> 90, sec. XCIII, para.13, Commentary on a verse from Sa’dí)

> I can have no doubt that should the holy breaths of Thy
> loving-kindness and the breeze of Thy bountiful favor
> cease, for less than the twinkling of an eye, to breathe
> over all created things, the entire creation would perish,
> and all that are in heaven and on earth would be reduced
> to utter nothingness. (PM 89, sec. 58, para.4)

It is the concept of continuous creation, typical of the Bahá’í
Faith, better explained in later Writings, as for example Law˙-i-
Óikmat. Bahá’u’lláh envisages a creation ruled by natural laws
which are expressions of the Word of God, intended both as
“the Cause which hath preceded the contingent world” and “the
Command of God which pervadeth all created things” (TB 140,
Law˙-i-Óikmat), that is, the creative impulse which brings into
existence physical reality, but also the universal law pervading
the entire creation.

8.21

Tishnagán, bar Salsabíl-i-quds-i-rabbání zaníd,

Kih shudih járí hamí án chashmiy-i-yá Húy-i-ú.
348                                                  Lights of Irfán vol. 15

O thirsty ones, plunge into the holy, and sanctified waters,

As the fountain is flowing of His enrapturing Call.

The lovers are thirsty, tishnagán, plural of tishnih, “Thirsty,
parched with thirst; eager, greedy, insatiable” (Steingass 303), of
the Water of Life, which Bahá’u’lláh calls in this verse Salsabíl,
explained by Steingass (693) as “Name of a fountain in Paradise;
mellow wine; anything soft, tender, digestible.” Shoghi Effendi
translates Salsabíl-i-quds as “sanctified waters” (GWB 323, sec.
CLIII, para.1; Muntakhabátí 208). The lovers are here invited to allay
their thirst at the fountain of Revelation, here called chashmih,
“a fountain, source, spring” (Steingass 394). Bahá’u’lláh often
mentions the thirst of human beings and the capacity of the
Word of God to allay that thirst:

> O banished and faithful friend! Quench the thirst
> (‘a†ash) of heedlessness with the sanctified waters of My
> grace, and chase the gloom of remoteness through the
> morning-light of My Divine presence. (GWB 323, sec. CLIII,
> para.1, Law˙-i-A˙mad bi-Fársí; Muntakhabátí 208)

> Verily I say, the world is like the vapor in a desert, which
> the thirsty (ßá˙ibán-i-‘atash) dreameth to be water and
> striveth after it with all his might, until when he cometh
> unto it, he findeth it to be mere illusion. (GWB 328-9, sec.

CLIII, para.8; Law˙-i-A˙mad bi-Fársí; Muntakhabátí 211)

> Thou well knowest, O my God, my Best-Beloved, that
> naught can quench the thirst (ẓamá’) I suffer in my
> separation from Thee except the waters of Thy presence
> ... (PM 58, sec. 41, para.3; Munáját 44)

> My remembrance of Thee, O my God, quencheth my
> thirst (‘a†ash), and quieteth my heart ... (PM 195, sec. 114,
> para.6; Munáját 132)

> Out of the pure milk, drawn from the breasts of Thy
> loving-kindness, give me to drink, for my thirst (al-

> a‘†ásh) hath utterly consumed me. (PM 234, sec. 145, para.1;
> Munáját 157)

> The attainment of this City quencheth thirst (‘a†ash)
> without water, and kindleth the love of God without
> fire. (KI 198, para.217; KMI153)

> O Lord! Dire thirst (ẓamá’) hath seized us, and with Thee
> are the soft-flowing waters of eternal life. (SLH 155, sec. 2,
> para.41, Súriy-Ra’ís; Majmú‘iy-i-Alvá˙-i Mubárakih 101)

8.22

Darvísh, zín bísh ma-zan nár-i-ma‘ání dar jahán,22

Kih shudih yá Húy-i-ú áshuftiy-i-yá Húy-i-ú.
O Dervish, stop setting the fire of meanings to the world:

His enrapturing Call is entangled with His enrapturing Call.

Another maq†a‘, final verse, calling the poet to silence. At the
vision of the Beloved in love with Himself, the highest form of
love we as human beings can conceive, all things are silent. This
verse is reminiscent of many passages in the Bahá’í Writings
that describe the greatness of God’s revelation “whose power
hath caused the foundations of the mightiest structures to
quake, every mountain to be crushed into dust, and every soul
to be dumbfounded” (GWB 196, sec. XCVI, para.3):

> In this day the breeze of God is wafted, and His Spirit
> hath pervaded all things. Such is the outpouring of His
> grace that the pen is stilled and the tongue is speechless.

(KI 180-1, para.197)

> Reveal then Thyself, O Lord, by Thy merciful utterance
> and the mystery of Thy divine being, that the holy
> ecstasy of prayer may fill our souls — a prayer that shall
> rise above words and letters and transcend the murmur
> of syllables and sounds — that all things may be merged
350                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 15

> into nothingness before the revelation of Thy splendor.

(‘Abdu’l-Bahá, quoted in BP 69)
