## 'Abdu'l-Bahá's Address at Clark University

### by [Abdu'l-Bahá](https://bahai-library.com/author/Abdu'l-Bahá)

1912-05-23


> **About:** ’Abdu’l-Bahá spoke around 4:00pm on May 23 1912, in the gymnasium that was located in the basement of Jonas Clark Hall at Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts. The text of the Master's talk was published in Persian in _Star of the West_ and translated by Bahá'ís in Worcester in the 1970s and deposited in the Library Archives at Clark University, where the text was recovered May 2011. See many more details at [worcesterbahais.org/content/history-faith-worcester](https://worcesterbahais.org/content/history-faith-worcester), [worcesterbahais.org/content/abdul-baha-worcester](https://worcesterbahais.org/content/abdul-baha-worcester), and [abdulbahainworcester.blogspot.ca/2012/01/14-clark-university-ii.html](http://abdulbahainworcester.blogspot.ca/2012/01/14-clark-university-ii.html).

                   ‘ABDU'L-BAHÁ at CLARK UNIVERSITY: MAY 23, 1912

('Abdu'l-Bahá’s remarks on this occasion were impromptu: apparently only a visit to Clark University
had been planned, but upon receiving a very cordial welcome from a waiting assemblage of about 500
students and faculty, He responded with a brief speech. As was usually the case, His remarks were
recorded by a secretary. These were later printed, in Persian, in star of the West magazine. The
rendering into English which follows was done in May, 1971 by two of the Friends in Worcester, one of
whom is a native Persian. The Biblical quotation used by 'Abdu'l-Bahá is apparently that found in
Matthew 13:13, and the language of that verse in the King James Version has been used in the
following text.)

Blessed audience, I am overjoyed to be with you here today. It had been my hope to visit this
University, and now that hope has been fulfilled.

This University will be the source of great things, for science is the special merit of human beings, and
is that which distinguishes man and gives him superiority over the other creatures of God.
Through the knowledge bestowed by science, human beings can discover the secrets of the Universe.
With science alone can man unlock the secrets of the past and accurately forecast the shape of future
events. With science he can explain the processes of nature, and can comprehend the movements of the
heavenly bodies. Science glorifies man forever; it is his means of achieving honor and dignity in the
world.

Science can also unlock the secrets of the Holy Books: It un covers the secret of reality. Science serves
the world of reality: It can save man from the superstition of the religions of the past, revealing to him
the reality of the religions of God.

Science can set man free from the captivity of nature, and diminish the power of nature's negative
forces. For nature, indeed, holds all things in the Universe in captivity: The earth, with its stones, trees
and animals, the sun itself in all its glory--none can make the slightest departure from nature's laws. But
man--man with the aid of science can rend asunder nature's laws and produce a new law for nature
itself to follow.

Science takes the sword from the hand of nature and uses it against nature in the service of man. Solid
objects are made to fly through the air at man's command, or to float on or beneath the surface of the
water. The power of electricity is trapped in a glass bulb; the spoken word is held and preserved;
airwaves become the carriers of messages; ships sail on land; deserts become oceans; mountains are
rent asunder. North is brought closer to South; West is joined to East. And although these occurrences
stand outside the realm of the law of nature, man through science achieves them, bringing art and
industry out of obscurity and into the light.
Unless man is free, then all the Universe is in bondage to nature's laws. Man alone has the capacity for
freedom, and it is science that is the implement of his freedom. Thus, science is the highest merit of
humanity: It's glory endures; it has an eternal lifetime. The role of the King is temporary; that of the
scientist has enduring glory. A man, though weak physically, if wise with the power of science can
discover the secret truths of the Universe and win undying fame. For the mass of men are like those
drugged in sleep, and the man of science is he who is awake; the mass of men are unknown to fame, and
the man of science is renowned: Science is like a candle, and the learned man like a lantern.

And so it is that I am in utmost joy to be here at this center of learning. My hope is that this University
will grow and disseminate the light of science which can illuminate the whole world, giving sight to the
blind, hearing to the deaf and life to those who are as dead. For as the Bible says: "… Because they
seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand." And Christ in the Holy Book
says: I will heal them.
And so it is proven that the ignorant is dead where the scholar lives, the ignorant blind where the
scholar is sighted, the ignorant deaf but the scholar endowed with hearing--and the noblest of all things
is science.
In this country, science is established in the schools and universities. My wish is that other countries
may follow your example, raising the standard of science in the cause of overthrowing superstition. The
imitation of useless forms that only divide people must be rejected; prejudice must be changed to
cooperation; the banner of peace for all mankind must be raised, and all the continents of the world be
shaded by the pavilion of universal peace.

Science shall unite all people, making of all the nations one country, and of all the earth one homeland.
All the religions shall be one, and science can reveal this reality. For all the religions come from God,
and they are reality. But now mankind is shadowed by worthless superstitions, which darken the light of
the sun of reality. These clouds must be dispersed, that the reality of all religions having their source in
the One God may be revealed. There is only this one reality, and all of the religions must join together,
banishing prejudice and enmity. Thus will the unity of the world be realized.

Therefore, since science casts out fear and reveals the Kingdom of Heaven, I ask God to raise the
banner of science higher each day, to make its star shine ever brighter, until all the populations of the
world attain to understanding. Let minds advance, inventions increase, let hearts expand and
understanding deepen. Let mankind make progress in all his goodly endeavors, and under the shadow of
Almighty God, let the utmost happiness be realized by all mankind. For all of these things are present
potentially in the world of reality, and the gift of God for unleashing this potential is science.
I have come from a remote land. I have seen here gatherings of honorable men of science, who have
established systems for the spreading of knowledge. I will tell of these things when I return, urging all to
learn the useful arts of science and technology. And my hope is that you will welcome the people of the
East--from India, China, Japan, Arabia, Armenia--that upon returning to their native soil they will
propagate this innovative knowledge, until the East can equal the West in science and technology. They
have the aptitude, but have no means for a formal, disciplined education. Thus it is my hope that science
will flourish all the more, here in the West, that all the nations of the world may thereby be enlightened,
that true communication may thereby be established, and that the potential happiness of the world of
humanity may thereby be revealed. May the science of the knowledge of God flourish too in East and
West, that human rights and dignities may be protected, human virtues be encouraged, and that the
utmost unity and harmony may prevail. This is my utmost desire. This is my purpose in visiting America.
