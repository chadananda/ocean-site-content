## Prayer for Steadfastness

### by [Abdu'l-Bahá](https://bahai-library.com/author/Abdu'l-Bahá)


O Thou beloved of my heart and soul! I have no refuge save thee. I raise no voice at dawn except in thy commemoration and praise. Thy love encompasseth me and Thy Grace is perfect. My hope is in Thee.  
  
Oh God, give me a new life at every instant and bestow upon me the breaths of the Holy Spirit at every moment, in order that I may remain steadfast in Thy love; attain unto great felicity, perceive the manifest light and be in the state of utmost tranquillity and submissiveness.  
  
Verily, Thou art the Giver, the Forgiver, the Compassionate.  
  
—'Abdu'l-Bahá
