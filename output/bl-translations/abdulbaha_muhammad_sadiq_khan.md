## Tablet to Hájí Muhammad Sádiq Khán: Excerpt

### by [Abdu'l-Bahá](https://bahai-library.com/author/Abdu'l-Bahá)

translated by [Hasan M. Balyuzi](https://bahai-library.com/author/Hasan%20M.%20Balyuzi).  
published in Eminent Bahá'ís in the Time of Bahá'u'lláh with some Historical Background, page 28  
London: George Ronald, 1985  
originally written as "Lawh Hájí Muhammad Sádiq Khán".


_T_he true morn dawneth from the depths of a darksome night, and the world-illuminating light of day poureth forth from the canopy of a night of gloom. The enchanting flower bloometh on a branch of thorns, and multitudinous plants grow out of the sad, sodden earth. The delightful fruit sprouteth upon a piece of wood. Thus is seen the truth of the words, "Thou bringest the living out of the dead, and Thou bringest the dead out of the living."\[1\]\[2\] The Commander of the Faithful\[3\] was wont to say to Muhammad, the son of ’Abú-Bakr: "Thou art my child."\[4\] Clear it is that physical fatherhood and sonship are not factors of true import. Canaan was the son of Noah and Abraham was the son of Ádhar.\[5\] One father was a Prophet, but His son was disowned and cut off. Another father was an idolater, yet his Son was the great and exalted Friend\[6\]....Therefore be not saddened. Pray thou and supplicate at the threshold of the One True God, begging forgiveness for thine earthly father. ’Abdu’l-Bahá’ will also, with utmost lowliness, implore at the threshold of God that perchance the musk-laden breeze of His forgiveness may waft over the Khán\[7\] and from the billowing sea of His grace a wave may pass over him and cleanse him of the defilement of sin and transgression. This is not far removed from the ocean of the grace of Bahá, His mercy, and His pardon.....

**Notes**  
  
\[1\] The title of this Tablet is provisional and uncertain as Balyuzí records that it was revealed in response to a letter from the celebrated Bahá’í poet Qábil on behalf of Hájí Muhammad Sádiq Khán. The date of this Tablet is unknown (MF’s note).  
  
\[2\] Qur’án 3:27 (Balyuzí’s note).  
  
\[3\] ’Alí Ibn Abú-Talib, the first Imám (Balyuzí’s note).  
  
\[4\] Muhammad ibn ’Abú-Bakr was a loyal follower of ’Alí, the first Imám. He was appointed by ’Uthmán ibn ’Affán, the third Khalif, to be govenor of Egypt, but this appointment was thwarted through intrigue that may have been authored by the Khalif himself. Muhammad was barbarously and treacherously put to death in Egypt, probably on the orders of Mu’áwíyah, the first Umayyad Khalif, so that another Umayyad could be appointed governor. See Hasan M. Balyuzí, _Muhammad and the Course of Islám,_ p. 175 and 186. (MF’s note).  
  
\[5\] The father of Abram (Abraham) is refered to as Terah in the Old Testament and Azar (Ádhar) in the Holy Qur’án. See Genesis 11:26 and Qur’án 6:74 (MF’s note).  
  
\[6\] A sincere friend. Abraham is known as _Khalílu’lláh_ \- the Friend of God (Balyuzí’s note).  
  
\[7\] The father of Hájí Muhammad Sádiq Khán, Luft-’Alí Khán, who was the commander of the Qashqá’í Regiment during the second upheaval of Nayríz in 1853 (Balyuzí’s note, expanded by MF).
