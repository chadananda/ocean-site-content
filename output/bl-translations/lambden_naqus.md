             The Tablet of the Bell (Law˙-i-Náqús) of Bahá’u’lláh
or The Tablet of “Praised Be Thou, O ‘He’!”

(Law˙-i-Subhánaka yá Hu[wa])
introduced and translated by Stephen Lambden

Introductory note

Miscellaneous Bahá’í sources indicate that the wholly Arabic Law˙-i-náqús (“Tablet of the
Bell”) or (after the constant refrain) Law˙-i-subhánaka yá-hú (“Tablet of Praised be Thou, O
He!) is to be dated to 1280/1863 CE or to the period of Bahá’u’lláh’s residence in Istanbul
(Constantinople). The title Law˙-i-náqús derives from the words “Strike the Bell” ( sing. náqús)
in the opening (post introductory) line (see below). Bahá’u’lláh wrote this work in his own hand
on the evening of the ( lunar) celebration of the declaration of the Báb on the 5th of Jumádí al-
Awwál 1280 AH = October 19th 1863 CE. It was apparently on that occasion that Áqá
Muhammad ‘Alí Tambaku Furush-i-Ißfahání precipitated this revelation through the intermedi-
ary of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (letter of Shoghi Effendi to Mírzá Badí‘u’lláh Ágahabadihi. cited Ganj, 71;
Revelation of Bahá’u’llah 2:18).

The non-qur’a nic Arabic loan-word náqús derives from (Christian) Aramaic-Syriac
( naposha/naqqús) and indicates a pierced wooden clapper-board which had a gong or bell-like
function in making a noise when hit with a stick. It was used in Eastern Christian regions for
calling the faithful to worship or to other religious functions. Around (Eastern) Christian
churches the naqús was sounded or clapped and, like the Islamic mu‘adhdhin, called the faith-
ful to assemble for prayer. Perhaps this sound was heard by Bahá’u’lláh around Christian
churches in Istanbul.

In Bábí-Bahá’í scripture and Shí‘í/Shaykhí literatures there are various references to the
eschatological náqús. In a number of His Writings Bahá’u’lláh personifies Himself as the
“Bell” (náqús) which summons the faithful to enter the Abhá paradise or Kingdom of God (the
Bahá’í Faith). His Revelation is the ringing of the “Bell” of his Person which invites humankind
to the assemblage of paradise. One may recall, for example, the following opening lines from
the second Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh to Napoleon III:

> O King of Paris! Tell the priest to ring the bells (lit. ‘strike the clapper-boards’ = nawáqís)
> no longer. By God, the True One! The Most Mighty Bell (al-náqús al-afkham = Bahá’u’lláh)
> hath appeared in the form of Him Who is the Most Great Name (al-ism al-a‘Ωam), and the
> fingers of the will of Thy Lord, the Most Exalted, the Most High, toll it out in the heav-
en of Immortality, in His name, the All-Glorious (al-abhá) . . .

trans. Shoghi Effendi, Promised Day is Come, 29
In making the following tentative provisional translation I have consulted the Arabic texts
of the Law˙-i-náqús published in Adí‘ah-yi hadrat-i-mahbúb (Cairo 1339/1920-1) 141-153 and
Risálih-yi ayyám-i-tis‘ih (rep. Los Angeles: Kalimat Press, 1981) 100-106 as well as various

unpublished manuscripts. I have also benefited from consulting the previous translations of
‘Alí Kuli Khan and Marzieh Gail (unpublished) and that of Denis MacEoin ( Rituals in Bábísm
and Bahá’ísm [ London 1994] App. XXVI, pp. 169-172). The following translation is not, how-
ever, based upon a critically established text nor is it in any way superior to those just men-
tioned. As the translation is fairly literal it will at times be virtually identical to previous ren-
derings.

In diverse ways and in cryptic, mystical, Sufistic language Bahá’u’lláh celebrates the power
of His recently, Ri∂ván-intimated ( late April early May 1863) theophanic status. As the secret-
ed “Monk of the Divine Unicity”, He is bidden by God to go some way toward disclosing His
being a supreme heavenly Maiden possessed of the power of divine revelation.

In line [3] and elsewhere in the Law˙-i-náqús, Bahá’u’lláh alludes to that portion of the Súrat
al-huriyya (‘Súra of the Maiden,’ the 29th sura of the Qayyúm al-asmá’ mid. 1844 CE) in which
the Báb makes reference to the partial yet stunning theophanic disclosure of a veiled, silken
clad houri characterised by resplendent beauty (al-bahá). Both lines 4 and 5, furthermore seem
to allude, for example, to the person of Bahá’u’lláh as a conjunction or incarnation of the let-
ters “B and “H” which constitute that Beauty-Splendour (Bahá) which, according to a well-
known prophetic hadíth ( greatly beloved of Rúzbihán Baqlí Shírází d.1209 CE) is his pre-exis-
tent Reality—the Prophet Muhammad is reckoned to have said “The Red Rose is expressive of
the Beauty-Splendour of God” ( al-ward al-a˙mar min bahá’ Alláh).

Law˙-i-Náqús*

[0]
He is the Almighty

[1]
This [ Tablet] is the Meadow of Paradise

wherein the melody of God,
the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting,

hath been exalted.

[2]
Therein hath Houris [ Maidens] of Eternity (huriyyát al-khuld)
been empowered whom none hath touched save God,

the Almighty, the Sanctified.

[3]
Therein doth the Nightingale of Eternal Subsistence

warble upon the branches of
the Lote-Tree of the Extremity (sidrat al-muntahá)

with such a melody as hath
bedazzled discerning souls (al-‘uqúl).

Therein is that through which the poor and needy (al-fuqará’)

are made to approach
the shore of independent self-sufficiency (shatí al-ghaná’)
and the people obtain guidance unto the Word of God ( kalimát Alláh). [5]

Such, indeed, is the certain Truth!

In Thy Name “He”
for Thou, verily, art “He,” O “He”!
O Monk of the Divine Unicity! ( ráhib al-a˙adiyya)

Strike the Bell! (al-náqús)

the Transcendent, the Mighty, the Munificent.

O Lamp of the worldly dominion! (siráj al-mulk)
Extinguish thy very self, for the Lamp of God (siráj Alláh)
hath radiated within the Niche of Eternity (mishkat al-baqá’)
illuminating thereby the inhabitants of the heavens and of the earth.

O oceans of the earth!
Be stilled of thy tempestuous waves
for the Crimson Sea (al-bahr al-ahmar)
surgeth through an innovative directive (bi-amr badí‘)

O Peacock of the divine Oneness! (táwús al-ahadiyya)!
Shriek out within the thicket of the divine realm (ajamat al-láhút)

for the melody of God (naghmat Alláh)
hath become evident from every divinely proximate locale.

O Bird of Perpetuity! (dík al-ßamadiyya)!
Be muted in the thicket of the Omnipotent Realm (ajamat al-jabarút)

for the Crier of God (munádí Alláh)
crieth out from every unassailable locale (shatr maní‘).

\[118\] The Tablet of the Bell

O Concourse of enraptured lovers! (malá’ al-ushsháq)

Good news for thy selves
in that the separation (al-firáq)
is completed and the promised Testament (al-mitháq)

hath come to pass;
the Loved One (al-ma‘shúq) hath been manifested
with a mighty, transcendent Beauty (jamál ‘izz maní‘).

O Concourse of Gnostic initiates! (malá’ al-irfán)
Rejoice within thine inner realities for era of Renunciation (al-hijrán) is terminated,

certitude (al-íqán) is realized
and the Beauty of the Youth (jamál al-ghulám)
hath beamed forth with an holy ornament (bi-taraz al-quds)

in a Paradise of matchless name (firdaws ism makín).

Praised be Thou, O my God,
I supplicate Thee by Thy [eschatological] Day (yawm)
through which all [ previous] Days have been raised up

and in view of the fact that through It
[matters rooted in] primordial (al-awwalín) and latter day
[eschatological] (al-akharín) eras

have been brought to account.

And by Thy Name which Thou didst make a Sovereign
in the Omnipotent sphere of Names (jabarút al-asmá’)

as well as a Judge (hákim) over
whomsoever are in the heavens and on the earth[s].

By this means make Thou such persons to be independent (aghniyá’)

of all except Thee, associated with Thee
and detached from whatsoever is other than Thee
for Thou indeed art One Powerful, Mighty, Compassionate.

Do Thou make them, O my God,
> to be such as give assent to Thy Singleness (wahdániyya)
> and who willingly concede Thy Uniqueness (firdániyya)
in such wise that they shall witness nothing but Thine Own Logos-Self

and envision none but Thee.
In this respect Thou, verily, art One Powerful, Mighty.

Establish then in their hearts, O my Beloved,

the fiery warmth of Thy love
in such measure that it may burn away

the remembrance of all save Thee.
This such that they may witness within themselves
that Thou hath ever been in the Sublime Apex of Eternity,

\[120\] The Tablet of the Bell

that there hath never been anything alongside Thee,
and that Thou art now the like of what Thou hath ever been.

No god is there except Thee, the Munificent.

> If such of Thy servants as desire to scale
> the heights of Thy Divine Unity (tawhíd)
should content themselves with the mention of aught besides Thee,
confirmation of their realization of the Divine Oneness (hukm al-tawhíd)

would never be ratified
neither would the mode of the Divine Uniqueness (simat al-tafríd)

be truly affirmed within their being.

So praised be Thou, O our God! O my God!
given this situation do Thou send down from the clouds of Thy Mercy

that which will purify the breasts of Thy lovers
and that which will sanctify the hearts of such as are enraptured by Thee.

Then exalt them through Thy loftiness
and render them triumphant over such as inhabit the earth.
This indeed is what Thou promised Thy beloved ones

through Thine indubitable utterance,
“We desire to shower Our favour (mann) upon

such as are enfeebled on earth
and to make them leaders [ Imams] (a’imma)
and to make them Our heirs (al-wárithín)” (Qur’án 28:5).
