> Lawh-i-Hertik, as the Tablet addressed to Georg David Hardegg is usually called, contains in an open and straightforward manner the proclamation of Bahá'u'lláh as the Promised One and the return of the Father to earth. The recipient, one of the two leaders of the Wurttemberg Templers of Germany who arrived in Palestine, expecting the coming of the Lord, in the same year as Bahá'u'lláh, is addressed in a very friendly manner and is given advice by which the validity of Bahá'u'lláh's claims may be recognized. He also is warned not to make the same errors of the Pharisees, who neglected the validity of Christ's own claims.

                     The Tablet to Hardegg (Law˙-i-Hirtík)
A Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh to the Templer Leader Georg David Hardegg1

introduced and translated by Stephen Lambden

írzá Óusayn ‘Alí Núrí entitled Bahá’u’lláh (the “Splendor of God”, 1817-1892) Who

M        founded the Bahá’í Faith in the middle of the 19th century, addressed a number of

scriptural tablets ( alwá˙) to Christians during the latest, West Galilean (Acre = Ar.

‘Akká’) period of His religious ministry (1868-1892 CE). Most notably His Law˙-i-Páp (Tablet
to Pope Pius IXth c.1869) and Law˙-i-Aqdas (“Most Holy Tablet,” late 1870s?) which was most
probably addressed to (“Dr.”) Fáris Effendi who had been converted to the Bahá’í religion by
Mullá Muhammad Nabíl-i-Zarandí (l831-1892) in Alexandria (in 1868).

It is now clear that the letter of Bahá’u’lláh commonly referred to as the Law˙-i-Hirtík was
also addressed to a Christian named Georg David Hardegg (=Hirtík) (1812-1879). During the
time of Bahá’u’lláh’s imprisonment in ‘Akká’, Hardegg was the leader of the
Tempelgesellschaft (Association of Templers [alternatively, ‘Templars’]) community in Haifa.

On first coming to know something of the nature of the Law˙-i-Hirtík through the note on
it in ‘Abd al-Óamíd Ishráq Khávarí’s Ganj-i-sháygán,2 (and since it had not been published), I
wrote to the Bahá’í World Centre in Haifa requesting a copy for detailed study. On receipt of
a typed copy (cf. text below) I began to try to work out what the consonants H-R-T-K might
signify, as they were evidently neither indicative of an Arabic nor a Persian construction.
Ignoring the pointing and guessing that it might indicate the name of the recipient of the let-
ter, the name Hardegg eventually sprang to mind. I then consulted Moojan Momen’s The Bábí
and Bahá’í Religions and was delighted to find that what was obviously a very garbled transla-
tion of the Law˙-i-Hirtík had been forwarded by the missionary Rev. John Zeller (c.1830-1902)
to the English Church Missionary Society and identified as a letter of Bahá’u’lláh to Hardegg.3
Furthermore, as Zeller’s letter forwarding Bahá’u’lláh’s Law˙-i-Hirtík was dated July 8 1872, it
may be inferred that the Law˙-i-Hirtík was written between late 1868 (when both Bahá’u’lláh
and Hardegg arrived in ‘Akká’ and Haifa respectively) and 8th July 1872. It was thus most prob-
ably between late 1871 and early 1872 (=1288-1289 AH) that Bahá’u’lláh addressed this Tablet
to the Templer leader.

Hardegg and the Tempelgesellschaft

The Tempelgesellschaft was founded by the German theologian and polemicist Christoph
Hoffmann (b. Leonberg 1815 d. Jerusalem 1885) whose religious orientation was rooted in
German Pietism of an highly chiliastic nature. Influenced by the belief that God’s judgement
and the parousia (‘presence’, return) of Christ were at hand, and critical of the “conventional
Christianity” of his day, he came, whilst residing in Ludwigsberg in the early 1850’s, to advo-
cate the creation of the “people of God” (Ger. das Volk Gottes). He was apparently influenced
either by events of the Crimean War (1853-6) or the belief that the Ottoman Empire was crum-
bling, in such a way that he conceived the idea that he and his people might become heirs to the

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Four

biblical promises. He elaborated a theory centering upon the [ Jerusalem] Temple and its
restoration and dreamed of a mass emigration to Palestine.

In 1854 such visionary ideas led Hoffmann to establish the Gesellschaft für Sammlung des
Volkes Gottes in Jerusalem (The Association for the Assembling of God’s People in Jerusalem).
In this he was aided by his associate Georg David Hardegg a native and merchant of
Ludwigsberg, who had turned to mysticism after being imprisoned for revolutionary activities.
By the mid-1850s Hoffmann and Hardegg had managed to enlist around 10,000 members. An
attempt was made via the Frankfurt Assembly to petition Sultan ‘Abd al-Majíd (Ottoman Sultan
from 1839-1861) for permission to settle in Palestine. This petition failed and the members of
the association had to content themselves with the establishment of a settlement near Marbach
(1856). Four of the leaders of the movement, including Hoffmann and Hardegg, visited
Palestine in 1858. To some extent they came to realize the largely impractical nature of their
eschatologically oriented ambitions. Then, in 1859, the leaders of “God’s people” were formal-
ly expelled from the National Evangelical Church. Consequently, in 1861, they set up their own
distinctive religious body at Kirschenhardhof, the Deutsche Tempel (The German Temple).
Hoffmann acted as spiritual leader and Hardegg as provisional secular leader, with an adviso-
ry council of 12 elders.

By 1867, numbers had dwindled to just 3,000, including women and children. Despite this,
in 1868 a group of Templer families made an abortive attempt to settle in the Nahalal area.
Though by this time a bitter antagonism had come to exist between Hoffmann and Hardegg,
it was decided to emigrate to Palestine and attempt to gain support for the movement from
there. Thus, both Hoffmann and Hardegg arrived at Haifa on the 30th of October 1868. They
began establishing, amidst considerable local opposition and difficulty, an initially agricultur-
al settlement. A few dozen Templer families from Württemberg (S. Germany) settled at the foot
of the western cape of Mt. Carmel. According to Katz they were “joined by kindred families
of German origin from southern Russia, and by some who had emigrated to America and
become citizens, mainly from New York state” (Katz 1994:263).

In 1869 Hoffmann migrated to Jaffa where he came to establish a school and a hospital. By
1874 the breach between Hoffmann and Hardegg was such that the latter founded his own
Temple Unity having gained the support of about one third of the perhaps 200 (?) members of
the Haifa community. These supporters of Hardegg subsequently returned to the (German)
Evangelistic Church, though the Haifa Templers under new leadership continued to prosper.
They contributed notably to the modernization and improvement of local Haifa conditions.
Despite sometimes marked local opposition from Muslims and Christian Arabs, the number of
Haifa Templers rose from about 300 in the early 1880s to around 750 at the time of the out-
break of the First World War (1914).5

Among the letters contained in J. M. Emmerson’s travelogue entitled New York to the
Orient (1886) is one that includes details about local circumstances in Haifa and Acre includ-
ing the position of the “German Colony” (=Templars):

> One of the most noteworthy and interesting features of Haifa is the settlement here of
> group of Germans, known as the German Colony. They came here some twenty-five years
> ago, being prompted to emigrate thither by a religious sentiment. There are three distinct
> colonies of them in Palestine—at Jerusalem, Jaffa, and Haifa—consisting of about one
> thousand members. The colony here [at Haifa] numbers some three hundred persons, and
> they are in many respects a remarkable people. The appearance of the part of the city they
> occupy is in striking contrast with the main town in that it is regularly laid out, and is

\[98\] The Tablet to Hardegg

> clean and orderly. These colonists are the only people who have ever come to live in
> Palestine who are self-supporting. (Emmerson 1887:113).6

Hardegg and the Bahá’í religion

As previously indicated, Bahá’u’lláh, along with over 60 followers and members of His fam-
ily, arrived as prisoners at ‘Akká’ on August 31st 1868 some 40 days before Hoffmann and
Hardegg arrived at Haifa to found their colony. Though at first subject to strict confinement
within the barracks as decreed by Sul†án ‘Abd al-‘Azíz, He had, by late 1871, managed to estab-
lish Himself in the house of ‘Údí Khammár in the heart of the Christian quarter of ‘Akká’.
From there, Bahá’u’lláh succeeded in gaining the devotion of a number of local notables,
including Shaykh Ma˙múd ‘Arrábí (d. late 1890s, later Muftí of ‘Akká’).

Hardegg came into contact with the Bahá’ís in Haifa and ‘Akká’ before Bahá’u’lláh’s move to
the House of ‘Údí Khammár. Jakob Schumacher (1825-1891; American consular agent for Haifa
and Acre for almost twenty years), a naturalized American citizen of German origin (Katz,
1994:120) and Templer who became head of the Haifa colony after Hardegg, wrote the follow-
ing (partially cited) letter published in the official Templer publication Süddeutsche Warte of
June 29 1871:

> I can give notice of yet another spiritual phenomenon which can strengthen our belief.
> This concerns 70 Persians, who have been banished to ‘Akká’ on account of their beliefs.
> Mr. Hardegg has already spent considerable time and effort trying to discover the actual
> basis of their belief, and had dealings with them through an interpreter just yesterday.
(cited Momen, op. cit., 236).

Shortly after the publication of Schumacher’s note on the Bahá’ís, an article by Hardegg him-
self, dated June 15 1871, was published in the same organ of the Templers for 20 July 1871.
This article provides some details of Hardegg’s efforts to understand Bahá’í doctrine and his-
tory. Hardegg also refers to an interview he had in ‘Akká’ on 2 June 1871 with Bahá’u’lláh’s
eldest son ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (1844-1921), having failed to gain an interview with Bahá’u’lláh him-
self. He also notes his contacts with the Bahá’ís of Haifa and records his impression that “these
people, despite all the obscurity of their knowledge, were seeking the truth” (cited, Momen,
ibid, 237). Hardegg most likely made other trips to ‘Akká’ in order to investigate Bahá’í beliefs
and attempt to interest or convert the Bahá’ís to Christianity.

The missionary James J. Huber (1826-1893), who resided at Nazareth during the 1870s, has
recorded in a letter dated November 28 1872 that Hardegg had invited him to accompany him
on a visit to the ‘Akká’ Bahá’ís. They travelled together to ‘Akká’ in October 1872 having been
promised an interview with Bahá’u’lláh by some of the Bahá’ís. Perhaps as a result of
Bahá’u’lláh’s withdrawal in the house of ‘Údí Khammár following Bahá’í-Azalí tensions and the
misdeeds of certain Bahá’ís which culminated in the murder of several Azalis.7

Hardegg’s desire to gain an interview with Bahá’u’lláh has been referred to by Bahá’u’lláh
Himself in a scriptural Tablet ( Law˙) which was perhaps written around 1875 and addressed to
Óájjí Mírzá Óaydar ‘Alí Isfahání (d. Haifa 1920) (cf. Ganj,172-3). In it Bahá’u’lláh stated that
all the [ Holy] Books “make mention of the appearance of the Promised One in the Holy Land”.
He alludes to the Templers who came from afar to settle in the regions of the blessed Holy
Land. Calling to mind the well-known German Templer inscription Der Herr ist nahe [1871],”
meaning, “God is nigh” (cf. Ruhe, op. cit. 193n) the Templers are represented as having said
Ωuhúr nazdík ast, “The theophany [manifestation] is nigh and we have come that we might
attain unto it ( his presence).” Nevertheless, Bahá’u’lláh adds, they remain in great heedlessness.

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Four

None of the Templers had become Bahá’ís. Reference is then made to Hardegg and to the writ-
ing or revelation of the Law˙-i-Hirtík:

> A few years ago their leader [Hardegg] desired to attain [My] presence but this request did
> not find acceptance in the most-holy court.8 Nonetheless, a sublime and Most-Holy scrip-
> tural Tablet (Law˙-i-amna’-i-aqdas) was specifically sent down for him. In that Tablet was
> established that which enableth every righteous one to attain salvation and every wayfarer
> to reach the goal. Yet the confirmation of the utterance, “Let none touch it save those who
> are pure” was manifest for they did not attain even a drop of the ocean of its significances.
> (cited Ganj, 172-3)
> Though Bahá’u’lláh represents the 19th century Templers as a people who failed to understand
or respond to his message, the Bahá’ís seem to have had cordial relations with them. Bahá’u’lláh
Himself, on several occasions, perhaps had personal contact with them in the course of His
several trips to Haifa during the 1880s and early 1890s.

\[100\] The Tablet to Hardegg

The Law˙-i-Hirtík*

[ I]
In the name of God, the Most Holy.

[1]
Thy sealed letter arrived before the Wronged One.

[2]
There from did We catch a fragrance of thy sincerity towards God,

the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.

[3]
We entreat God that He might inform thee of that which is

concealed in an inscribed Tablet;

[4]
might enable thee to hearken
unto the cooing of the Dove upon the branches

and the murmuring of the Water of Life
which hath flowed with Wisdom and Explanation
from the spring of the Will of the King of Existence.

[ II]

O beloved one!
It is necessary that thine eminence contemplate the Word of God,

the grandeur and sweetness of which sufficeth all the worlds.

The first of those who believed in the Spirit [ Jesus]

was enraptured by the Word of his Lord
and through it turned and believed, detached from whatsoever

the people possess.

Such action is incumbent upon the

fishes of the Most Great Ocean.

[ III]

O Thou informed mystic knower

and insightful religious leader!

> Know thou that base passion hath hindered most mortals
> from turning their faces unto God, the King of Names.

Such, however, as gaze with the eye of insight,

shall bear witness and seeing, exclaim,
‘Praise be unto my Lord, the Most Exalted.’

Land and sea hath rejoiced at the Beneficence of God.

The nations were given the promise regarding

the appearance of the Healer of Infirmities.
He, assuredly, is the expected Builder of the Temple.

Blessed be such as are possessed of mystic knowledge.

> When the appointed time came, Carmel cried out,
trembling as if shaken by the breezes of the Lord,

‘Blessed be such as hearken!’

> Should anyone incline with the ear of the inner nature,
> the same would assuredly hear the cry from the Rock.

It, verily, proclaimeth in a most elevated voice

and beareth witness unto the Eternal God.

\[102\] The Tablet to Hardegg

Blessed be such as catch a fragrance of the Utterance

and turn unto the Kingdom,
detached from the contingent world.

When that which is mentioned in the Holy Books

hath come to pass,
thou shalt see the people beholding but not understanding.

[ IV]

O beloved one!
Behold the mystery of reversal
on account of the symbol of the Ruler
for He hath made their exalted ones their lowly ones

and their lowly ones their exalted ones.

And call thou to mind the fact that when Jesus came
He was rejected by the divines, the learned and the educated.

He who was a mere fisherman [ Peter],
on the other hand, entered the Kingdom.

This is the mystery of what was mentioned

in the heart of the words
by means of intimations and allusions.

[ V]

Great, great is the Cause!

Peter the Apostle,
in spite of his excellence and the eminence of his station,

held back his tongue when asked about it.

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Four

Shouldst thou consider sincerely
what hath heretofore come to pass,

for the sake of the Lord alone,
thou wilt assuredly see the Light shining before thine eyes.

The Truth is too manifest to be wrapped up in veils,

the Path too open to be enveloped in darkness
and the Certainty too evident to be obscured by doubts.

Those who have been held back are the ones who have
followed their lusts and are today slumbering, sleeping.

They shall wake up and run around but find no place to hide.

Blessed be such as catch the fragrance of Truth,
then awaken, that they might attain whatsoever the sincere

servants attained.

[ VI]

Know thou that We saw the exterior letter ßád

in the word “Peace” (Ar. ßul˙).

It, verily, was adorned with
the ornament of the upright letter “A” ( alif)
and is what hath assuredly been mentioned

in an Outspread Tablet.

And upon the manifestation of the lights of

that Divine Word,
the Gate of Heaven was opened
and the Kingdom of Names appeared.

\[104\] The Tablet to Hardegg

And this matter was completed through the letter “H” ( há)

after which it was united to the leveled letter “A” ( alif)
which was adorned with the Point (of the letter “B,” bá)
from which the Treasured Name, the Hidden Mystery

and the Guarded Symbol ( Bahá’ ) emerged.

It, verily, is the Point
from which existence hath appeared

and unto which it hath returned.

[ VII]

Then We saw the Word which uttered a Word
which every community found to be according to its own

tongue and language.

When that Word was uttered,
a Sun shone forth from the Horizon of its Announcement,

the Lights of which eclipsed the sun of the heavens.

It said,
‘The head of the seventy

hath been adorned
with the crown of the forty

and been united with
the seven before the ten.’

Then it lamented and it said,

‘What is this that I see?
The house doth not recognize its master
neither doth the son pay heed unto his father;
nor likewise is the hopeful seeker cognizant of his

place of refuge and haven.’

[ VIII]

O thou who soarest in
the atmosphere of mystic knowledge!

Whoso knoweth the one in whose Logos-Person

what floweth yet exhibiteth solidity;

what soareth yet is at rest;

what is manifest yet concealed

and what is resplendent yet veiled,

> shall be seized by the attraction of the divine Effulgences
to such an extent that he will fly on the wings of yearning

in the atmosphere of nearness, holiness and reunion.

[ IX]

With regard to that which thine eminence hath mentioned

concerning the darkness.

We bear witness that it hath encompassed the creatures.

Blessed be he who hath been illumined by the Light

which shineth forth from
the horizon of the Mercy of his Lord, the Most Holy.

The darkness is the vain imaginings by virtue of which
the people were prevented from turning towards the Kingdom
when the King of the Divine Realm

appeared with the Cause of God.

\[106\] The Tablet to Hardegg

[ X]

As for what thou hast mentioned,
that a certain person hath supposed
that there are no differences between Us

with regard to the Spirit [Jesus].

> This is indeed the truth inasmuch as the Spirit [Jesus]
is sanctified beyond being overwhelmed by differences

or encompassed by symbolic expressions.

He, verily, is the Light of Oneness among mankind
and the sign of the Ancient of Days among the peoples.

He who turneth unto Him [Jesus]
hath turned unto He [God]

who sent Him [Jesus]
and he who rejecteth Him hath

rejected He who caused Him
to be made manifest and to speak forth.

He hath ever been what He was
and will ever remain the same as what He was;
only the Effulgence of His theophany in the Mirrors
varies on account of Their different forms and colors.

[XI]

O beloved one!
Should a hint of the secret which was veiled in mystery be disclosed,

the hearts of those who cling unto what they possess
and cast away what is with God would be thrown into confusion.

If thine eminence would ponder upon what We have set forth for thee

and rise up according to what hath been mentioned with the greatest steadfastness,

there would, verily, be manifest from thee what was previously made manifest.

[XII]

O beloved one!
This Bird is ensnared betwixt
the talons of oppression and hypocrisy,
and seest no nest wherein He might dwell
nor any retreat unto which he might wing his way.

In such a state doth He summon mankind unto everlasting life.

Blessed be the attentive ear!
We ask God that He might bring us together in the same place
and might assist us in what He loveth

and is well-pleasing unto Him.

Notes
1) This article and the provisional translation of the Law˙-i-Hirtík was first published in the Bahá’í Studies

> Bulletin vol. 2/1 ( June 1983), 32-63 (© Hurqalya Publications). It has been very slightly revised since that
> time. This printing is without the detailed commentary which can be found in revised and expanded form
> on the author’s (forthcoming) personal website which contains an electronic reprint of the whole Bahá’í
> Studies Bulletin (1982).
2) Refer, Ganj, 172-3. Here Ishráq Khávarí mistakenly identifies the followers of the recipient of the Law˙-i-

Hirtík with the Millerites, the followers of William Miller (1782-1849 CE).
3) Refer Momen, The Bábí and Bahá’í Religions. 216-8.
4) In 1871 Hardegg’s son Ernst became US consular agent in Jaffa. There he remained in office until 1909 when

he resigned at the age of 70 (Kark, 1994:114).
5) On the Tempelgesellschaft refer to the entries in the bibliography below and Whitley, ‘Friends of the

> Temple,’ in Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics (6:141-2; Kolb, ‘Friends of the Temple’; Ussishkin,
> ‘Templers (Tempelgesellschaft)’ Enc. Judaica” 15:994-996 (this article is especially useful for details on 20th
> century Templer history); Carmel, Die Siedlungen; idem, ‘The German Settlers in Palestine...” 442-465; cf.
> also Oliphant, Haifa or Life in Modern Palestine, 17ff; Momen, The Bábí and Bahá’í religions 215f, 503,
> 506f, 521. For some useful information on contacts between Bahá’ís and Templers see Ruhe, Door of Hope,
> index.
6) A recent booklet put out by the Haifa Tourist Board entitled, ‘Bahá’í Shrine and Gardens on Mount Carmel,

> Haifa-Israel’ contains two pages which illustrate the Haifa project, “the restoration and development of the
> main axis of the German Templar Colony”. This small booklet contains some excellent photographs and
> details about the 19th century Templer building project and its anticipated restoration.
7) The Azalis are the followers of Bahá’u’lláh’s younger half-brother Mírzá Ya˙yá (c.1830-1914) who was enti-

tled Subh-i Azal (The Morn of Eternity) and had been exiled to Cyprus from Turkey in 1868.
8) The interview with Bahá’u’lláh did not materialise. Instead Hardegg and Huber conversed with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’

(cf. Momen, op. cit., 218).
