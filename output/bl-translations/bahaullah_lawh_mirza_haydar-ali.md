## Portion of Tablet to Hájí Mírzá Haydar-'Alí

### by [Bahá'u'lláh](https://bahai-library.com/author/Bahá'u'lláh)

translated by [Hasan M. Balyuzi](https://bahai-library.com/author/Hasan%20M.%20Balyuzi).  
published in Eminent Bahá'ís in the Time of Bahá'u'lláh with some Historical Background, page 244  
Oxford: George Ronald, 1985  
originally revealed as "Lawh-i-Hájí Mírzá Haydar-'Alí".


   _W_e hear thy cry and supplication at thy remoteness from the Dawning-Place of Light. Be patient and do not bewail thy plight. Be content with that which God hath ordained for thee. He verily, payeth the due recompense of those who are patient. Hast thou not seen My incarceration, My affliction, My injury, My suffering? Follow, then, the ways of thy Lord, and among His methods is the suffering of His well-favoured servants. Let nothing grieve thee. Put thy trust in thy Lord. He shall verily confirm thee, draw thee nigh unto Him and grant thee victory. Should affliction overtake thee in My path and abasement in My name, rejoice and be of the thankful. Thus have We imparted unto thee the word of truth so that when calamities descend upon thee, thy feet may not slip and thou shalt be as firm and steadfast as a mountain in the Cause of thy Lord.

**Note**

1.  This Tablet to Hájí Mírzá Haydar-’Alí is apparently not included in the _Leiden List of the Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh_ as Balyuzí definitely indicates that this text was revealed in Adrianople. The two known Tablets to Haydar-’Alí were both written in ’Ákká. This Tablet could therefore possibly be the earliest known to Haydar-’Alí. Haydar-’Alí seems to give a summation of this Tablet in Faizí’s book, _Stories from the Delight of Hearts: The Memoirs of Hájí Mírzá Haydar-’Alí,_ p. 33.
