The Words of Bahá’u’lláh, exalted be His Glory:\[1\]

   This is the Day\[2\] in which the Spirit\[3\] proclaimeth from the zenith\[4\] of heaven: “O Concourse of creation! Verily, the Sovereign of the world hath appeared and all that which was in the Kingdom of my Lord is fulfilled. Verily, the One Who was the beloved\[5\] of my heart, the One who aided me in my Cause,\[6\] hath come. Follow Him, and do not be of those who turn away. This is the Day in which all veils have been lifted\[7\] and thy Lord, the Almighty, the Most Bountiful hath made His appearance. Because of His Advent, all that which I promised thee hath been perfected and fulfilled. Haste ye then to His resplendent, most luminous Beauty!...

   “O Priests! Tell the servants that they should not ring the bells any longer except in His Name the Gracious, the most Transcendent.\[8\] This is the Day in which every thirsty one hath attained unto the river of everlasting life, and every eager one can behold the Beauty of the All Merciful. In this Day, every humbled one can attain dignity and every poor one wealth. The ailing can obtain healing, the deaf can hear His melody, and the blind have obtained sight. Render thanks unto God and be not of those who join partners with Him.\[9\] The kingdom of God circleth around Him and it is because of His Love\[10\] that I adorned the cross with my body.\[11\] Verily, I rose from the dead to complete my mention of His Name amongst men. O people of the Gospel! Do not make mention of Me (Jesus) when you have turned away from my Father, the All- Glorious. It is His love that transformed the fire to be a light for Abraham. He that tarrieth after Him is in manifest error. Haste ye, therefore, to the river of mercy, flowing from the presence of your Lord, the All-Merciful. Beware lest ye deprive yourself of this gushing river.\[12\] Verily, We have trained you for this Day. Peruse ye my words so that ye may obtain what my intention was in making mention of Him. Truly, I did not come but for His cause and I did not appear but to give the glad tidings of the advent of the Kingdom of God.” Thus doth command you the Spirit,\[13\] Who sacrificed His spirit to give life to the world and so that He may manifest what the sublime Purpose is. He, verily, hath appeared in truth.\[14\] Follow Him then, and adhere not to what ye possess of the accounts of ancient times.\[15\]
