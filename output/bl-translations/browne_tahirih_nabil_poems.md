SELECTED POEMS BY QURRATU'L-'AYN,  
NABIL AND OTHER BÁBÍS

    The following Persian poem was given to me in manuscript by the late Shaykh Ahmad _Rúhí_ of Kirmán, the ill-fated son-in-law and follower of Subh-i-Azal, who told me that the poem (of which, so far as I know, no other copy exists) was composed by Qurratu'l-'Ayn, and that the manuscript which I now publish is in her own handwriting1. Without being able to guarantee either of these assertions, I am inclined to credit them, for the poem is evidently by a Bábí, and the handwriting appears to be a woman's, closely resembling that of a letter from Qurratu'l-\`Ayn to Mullá Shaykh \`Ali (called _Janáb-i- Azím_) given to me by Subh-i-Azal, and reproduced in fac- simile, with printed text and translation, in my translation of the _New History_ (pp.434- 441). The two or three other poems ascribed to her are _ghazals_ written in the _Kámil_ metre. This, on the other hand, is a _mathnawí_ of the kind known as _Sáqí-náma_, or Invocations to the Cup-bearer, such as Háfiz and other lyrical poets have written.

\[three lines of PERSIAN TEXT\]

   1 It was enclosed in a letter written from Constantinople on Sept. 19, 1892, and received by me five days later. The writer says that in response to his request his friends in Persia had sent one leaf in "the blessed writing of Janáb-i- Táhira, who herself transcribed some of her works."
