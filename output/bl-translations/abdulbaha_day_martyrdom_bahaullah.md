### I. Traduit du Persan en Français par Rochan Mavaddat _(Traduction libre, non révisée)_, 2000-09-07

Il est le Tout-Glorieux!  
  
Ô toi, honoré 'Alí Akbar!\[1\]  
  
Aujourd'hui, c'est le jour du Martyr de Sa Sainteté le Báb, que notre âme soit sacrifiée pour son sang béni \[versé dans le Chemin de Dieu\]!  
  
Aujourd'hui, c'est le jour durant lequel ce "Soleil de Vérité" s'est occulté derrière les nuages!  
  
Aujourd'hui, c'est le jour durant lequel cet Astre lumineux s'est éclipsé!  
  
Aujourd'hui, c'est le jour durant lequel ce corps pur et sans taches a roulé dans la poussière rougie par son sang!  
  
Aujourd'hui, c'est le jour durant lequel sa poitrine et son coeur, immaculés et purs comme un miroir, ont été criblés par des milliers de balles!  
  
Aujourd'hui, c'est le jour durant lequel cette "Lampe divine" s'est débarrassée de son enveloppe physique!  
  
Aujourd'hui, c'est le jour durant lequel se font entendre les lamentations de l'Assemblée céleste!  
  
Aujourd'hui, c'est le jour durant lequel les habitants du Royaume de Dieu pleurent et gémissent, les yeux en larmes et le coeur déchiré!

### II. Translated from the French into English by Peter Terry

He is the All-Glorious One!  
  
O thou honoured 'Alí Akbar!\[1\]  
  
Today is the Day of His Holiness the Báb - may our souls be sacrificed for His hallowed blood \[spilled in the Path of God\]!  
  
Today is the day in which this "Sun of Truth" was hidden behind the clouds!  
  
Today is the day in which this luminous Star was eclipsed!  
  
Today is the day in which this pure and stainless Body fell in the dust reddened by His blood!  
  
Today is the day in which His breast and His heart, immaculate and pure as a mirror, were riddled with thousands of bullets!  
  
Today is the day in which this "divine Lamp" was relieved of His physical form!  
  
Today is the day in which were heard the lamentations of the Celestial Concourse!  
  
Today is the day in which the inhabitants of the Kingdom of God weep and tremble, their eyes full of tears and their hearts torn!

### III. Translated from the Persian into English by Khazeh Fananapazir

  
O thou honoured 'Alí Akbar!  
  
This day is the day of the Martyrdom of His Holiness, the Exalted One, may our heart be sacrificed for His sanctified blood.  
  
This Day is the day in which this "Sun of Truth" concealed itself behind the clouds of providence.  
  
This Day is the day in which this luminous Orb did set!  
  
This Day is the day in which that Body, pure and without blemish or spot fell upon and rolled onto the blood soaked earth  
  
This Day is the day in which His chest and His heart, immaculate and pure like unto a spotless mirror, was riddled by thousands of bullets!  
  
This Day is the day in which that "Divine Lamp" became severed from Its physical frame!  
  
This Day is the day in which the cries and lamentations of the Concourse on high are raised  
  
This Day is the day in which the inhabitants of the Kingdom of God weep and moan, the eyes in tears and their hearts torn!

**Note**

\[1\] That is, Mullá 'Alí-Akbar-i-Shahmirzadí, known as Hají Akhund, one of the four Hands of the Cause appointed by Bahá'u'lláh Himself. Early in life, he frequented discussions of philosophy and religion, becoming extremely well-verses in the current of his times. He first came into contact with the Faith when he was about nineteen. He became on fire for Bahá'u'lláh upon reading the _Kitáb-i-Íqán_ in 1861_._ He engaged in teaching, and was forced out of the city of Mashád as a result. He returned to his native city of Sháhmirzad in the province of Khurasan to teach there. He was imprisoned for the first time in Tihrán. Throughout his life, he was in prison a total of 6 times. In one of these cases, on the orders of Nasiri'd-Dín Sháh and his son Kamran Mírzá, the Governor of Tihrán, he suffered imprisonment in Tihrán for 18 months in 1891, but was released. He attained the presence of Bahá'u'lláh twice, once in 1873, and the second time in 1888. He was the recipient of many Tablets from the Blessed Beauty, including one in which is revealed a special prayer for the Hands of the Cause.

Hají Akhund rendered many services, both to the Faith, and his country. It was Hají Akhund who interceded to Bahá'u'lláh on behalf of the people of Irán, begging for relief from a severe famine, which had been sent as a chastisement after the martyrdom of Badí. It was also this same Hají Akhund, with the aid of Jamál-i-Burujird, who, in 1867-68, helped to transfer the remains of the Báb from the Shine of Imám-Zadih Ma'sum in Tihrán to the Mosque of Masha'u'lláh, in the village of Chashmih-'Alí, and from thence to the home of Mírzá Hasan-i-Vazir, again in Tihrán. See _The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh,_ Vol. 3, pp. 85-6, 200-1, 425-27, Vol. 4, 495-301 and _Memorials of the Faithful_, pp. 9-12 (MW's note).
