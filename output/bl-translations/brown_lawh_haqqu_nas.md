    Tablet on the Right of the People (Lawh-i haqq al-nas)

Introduction by Alison Marshall1

Tablet on the Right of the People (Lawh-i haqq al-nas) is an usual tablet in that it is entirely
devoted to an examination of one philosophical issue. That issue is hinted at by the term
‘haqq al-nas’ (right of the people) in the name the tablet is commonly known by. This term
has a wide meaning. In its plural form, ‘huquq al-nas’ (rights of the people), it can refer to the
private rights of individuals under Islamic law.2 In the tablet, Baha’u’llah discusses three
situations that relate to a person’s private rights - two relating to theft and one involving a
small debt. But, beyond the legal context, the term ‘right of the people’ also refers to the
spiritual rights a person has as a result of their righteous deeds. In this context, the rights are
founded in God’s promise to reward a person for their good deeds and punish those who do
wrong. An example of this promise is found in the following verses of the Qur’an:

> “As for those who disbelieve I shall chastise them with a heavy chastisement in the
> world and the hereafter; and they will have no helpers. And as for those who believe
> and do good works, He will pay them their wages in full. Allah loveth not
> wrongdoers.” (3:56-57)3

This principle is restated by Baha’u’llah. In “Words of Paradise”, for example, he tells us
that, on the fifth leaf of the Most Exalted Paradise, the Pen has let it be known that:

> “at the beginning of the foundation of the world [Wisdom] ascended the stair of inner
> meaning and when enthroned upon the pulpit of utterance ... proclaimed two words.
> The first heralded the promise of reward, while the second voiced the ominous
> warning of punishment. … Thus the basis of world order hath been firmly established
> upon these twin principles.” 4

This passage tells us that, at the beginning of the world, the embodiment of Wisdom
announced from the pulpit of meaning the twin principles of reward for good deeds and
punishment for bad deeds. As such, these two principles are at the foundation of world order.
The wording of the passage, with its focus on an announcement made in pre-eternity,
underscores the idea that the principles of reward and punishment are woven into the very

\[2\] In this case, the term is the partner to the corresponding term, ‘huquq allah’ or ‘rights of God’, which refers to
the rights that relate to the public interest. Anver M. Emon: “Huquq allah and Huquq al-’ibad: A Legal Heuristic

functioning and purpose of reality.5 They do not just occur at a social level in the physical
> world, where societies use justice systems to maintain law and order. Rather, they are
> satisfied through the processes of reality. Baha’u’llah’s philosophical examination of the
> issue of the right of the people describes the metaphysical processes involved and explains
> how, through them, compensation for a right is made good in the physical world and the
> spiritual worlds.

> The context for the tablet is a question put to Baha’u’llah by a correspondent who wanted to
> know how a person’s rights, breached in the physical world, are redressed in the spiritual
> worlds. The question is framed in the following way, although not in these terms. What is the
> mechanism by which someone’s personal rights are repaid in the next world? How is this
> process to be understood and how does it occur in the Day of Resurrection, which is also
> known to be the Day of Judgement? The physical and social structures that underpin the
> creation and recognition of personal rights in the physical world do not exist in the spiritual
> worlds. And even if a person’s rights, as conceived of in the physical world, did exist in the
> next world, they would not be of any use to the right-holder in that world. Therefore, how can
> these rights be compensated for in the next world? The questioner understands that there must
> be some mechanism by which restitution takes place because, as is commonly believed, God
> sometimes waives a debt owed to Him but never allows a debt owed to a person to be set
> aside.

> To answer this question, Baha’u’llah begins by setting out two metaphysical principles,
> which are closely connected. Commentaries on these two principles will no doubt run into
> volumes in centuries to come.

● Principle 1:​ Everything in the physical world - no matter what its name and

> description, and its form and attributes - appears in every one of the worlds of God in
> a manner that is appropriate to that world. And it appears in that other world with
> another name and description, and another form and other attributes.

● Principle 2:​ If a thing dies in this physical world, this death applies only to the body
​ ​         or form of the thing. The reality (​h.aqiqa) and essence (​dhāt) of the thing has not gone

> out of existence. This quintessential aspect of the thing continues to exist and to
> appear in the worlds of God in accordance with Principle 1.6

> If Principles 1 and 2 are put together, they constitute a very important statement about the
> functioning of reality. Principle 1 tells us that every thing in the physical world, no matter

Baha’u’llah makes the same point in other places too, such as in the Tablet of Maqsud: “The Great Being saith:
> The structure of world stability and order hath been reared upon, and will continue to be sustained by, the twin
> pillars of reward and punishment.” ​Tablets of Baha’u’llah: http://www.bahai.org/r/260206487

It is my assumption that the “reality” (​h.aqiqa) and “essence” (​dhāt) of a thing refers to its ‘existence’ and
​         ‘essence’, which correspond to the active force (​al-fá`il) and its recipient (​al-munfa`il).​ ​Baha’u’llah: Tablet of

Wisdom (Lawh-i Hikmat), http://www.bahai.org/r/893372526

what its name and description, and form and attributes, appears in different forms, with
different attributes, in each of the worlds of God. Principle 2 tells us that every thing has a
reality and essence that survives the ‘death’ - that is, a change or extinction - of its forms.
This means that the manifested forms of a thing can go through a process of radical change,
while the essential reality of the thing is unaffected. From these two Principles, we have the
general principle that every thing is, at core, a reality and essence, and that this reality and
essence manifests itself in different forms in all the worlds of God.

Probably, the primary example of this general principle is the Manifestation of God. The
reality and essence of the Manifestation is the Primal Will, or Word, of God. The Primal Will
manifests itself in infinite forms in all the worlds of God. We witness this phenomenon in the
physical world through the principle of the unity of the Manifestations. In accordance with
this principle, the Primal Will has appeared in the persons of, for example, Jesus,
Muhammad, the Bab and Baha’u’llah. Each one of them came with different names and
descriptions, and different forms and characteristics. But their reality and essence was the
same, and this did not go out of existence when one of these Manifestations died a physical
death.

Baha’u’llah continues his argument by applying Principles 1 and 2 to deeds.7 Each human
being has an essence and reality - that is, the soul - and our deeds are its attributes, which
have various names, descriptions and forms in all the worlds of God. The physical body is
also one of its attributes. When the body dies, our deeds continue to be manifested in all the
worlds of God as attributes of the soul. As a result, a person is necessarily confronted with
the manifestations of their own deeds, even if those manifestations do not appear in the same
form as they did when the deed was committed. Justice is carried out in whatever way God
determines, in any world of God, through this process of unfolding manifestations.

> “It is evident, then, that deeds will be preserved and every [acquired] attribute will
> continue to exist, so that through the attribute or deed itself requital can be given.
> Every [acquired] attribute a person possesses and every deed he commits, therefore,
> will reveal itself and take on a particular form in each world ‘so that He may requite
> each soul for what it has done.’”

The second half of the tablet is given to Baha’u’llah providing analogies, in a variety of
contexts, showing how a reality and essence, can have, simultaneously, different names and
descriptions, and forms and attributes in multiple worlds. The primary analogy he uses to

\[7\] He also applies them to words, as Baha’u’llah makes clear later on: “Were I to remove the veil from the
manifestations of the deeds, act, and words that appear in limitless and manifold forms in the worlds of God…”
The following hidden word suggests the principles also apply to thoughts: “O heedless ones! Think not the
secrets of hearts are hidden, nay, know ye of a certainty that in clear characters they are engraved and are openly
manifest in the holy Presence.” Persian Hidden Word 59

show how this phenomenon works is the dream, which he says is like the afterlife and said to
be its “brother”. In a dream, a person has an experience in the world of vision. Subsequently,
the person formulates a meaning of the dream by interpreting aspects of the vision experience
in terms of corresponding experiences in the person’s life in the physical world. Baha’u’llah
cites as an example Joseph’s dream from Qur'an 12:4, where it is recounted that Joseph
dreamed that the sun and the moon and eleven stars prostrated before him. Later, this
experience is revealed in the physical world when Joseph is seated on the throne of Egypt,
and his father, Jacob, and eleven brothers prostrate before him. Baha’u’llah explains that this
sequence of events, involving the dream event and its subsequent physical manifestation, is
an example of the principle that things have different manifestations in the worlds of God.
Here, the reality and essence of Jacob appears in the physical world as a man with a certain
bodily form, but in the dream world as a sun. Similarly, the brothers appear in the physical
world in their respective physical bodies, but in the dream world as stars. Therefore, the
essential realities of Jacob and the brothers appear in the physical world in forms that are
different to those in the dream world.

Baha’u’llah makes an important enigmatic statement about the relationship between the
manifestations of the essential realities of things in the dream world and their manifestations
in the physical world. First of all, he has the reader consider ​the nature of the dream world
from the perspective of the physical world. “Now consider. What kind of world is that
wherein his father and mother are seen as the sun and the moon, and his brothers appear in
the form of stars?” But then he reverses the perspective and has the reader consider ​the nature
of the physical world from the perspective of the dream world. “And what is this world
wherein the reverse is seen: the sun and the moon in the form of his father and mother, and
the stars in the form of his brothers?” In asking these opposing, but parallel, questions, I think
Baha’u’llah is calling into question the view that the physical world is real and the dream
world is unreal, consisting only of transitory, ephemeral images. In asking the second
question, Baha’u’llah forces the reader to view things in the physical world as symbols,
where the physical bodies of the father and brothers are just corresponding metaphorical
representations of the sun and stars of the dream world. From this perspective, the physical
things in this world, despite their concrete appearance, are just manifestations of the realities
and essences of things. Further on in the tablet, Baha’u’llah encourages the reader to see all
the worlds of God, including the physical world, as metaphorical.

> “God willing, to the extent you are cognizant of the divine worlds, you will recognize
> and understand the metaphorical nature of this world, and will be able to extend it to
> the limitless worlds.”

Baha’u’llah gives two further analogies illustrating how an essence and reality of a thing can
appear in a variety of forms and characteristics. But this time, instead of focusing on the
differences in form in the innumerable worlds of God, Baha’u’llah focuses on the physical

world alone and the way in which the manifestations of a thing change in form through time
in this world. Baha’u’llah gives the scenario of a person stealing seeds from someone else in
the season of spring. The thief plants the seeds and grows plants that bear fruit in summer. A
just king then determines to restore to the victim what was taken. But how would he go about
doing this? Would he return the seeds or give the victim the plants and their fruit?
Baha’u’llah concedes that a person could argue that the seeds no longer exist, and if they did
exist would no longer be of use, and that the plants and fruit are not the same thing as the
seeds. But Baha’u’llah rejects this position and argues that the seeds do still exist; they have
changed in form and become plants and fruit. Giving these to the victim constitutes fair
compensation for the loss of the seeds and, arguably, a more valuable return as a result of the
changes in form. The scenario highlights the fact that a victim’s right does not go out of
existence even though events in the world lead to changes in the appearances of things. The
reality and essence of the right is preserved and is restored to the right-holder in this world in
another form.

In some cases, Baha’u’llah says, a victim is compensated in this world for a loss without that
person being aware of it. The scenario he gives for this is where a person loses a great deal of
wealth as a result of misfortune or wrongdoing. The compensation for such a loss is the
lifting of the associated afflictions that come with possessing the wealth in the first place. If
the wealth is stolen, these afflictions will settle on the thief. Baha’u’llah sees this outcome as
a most efficient way to dispense justice.

Baha’u’llah ends the tablet with a second analogy related to changes in the manifested forms
of things in the physical world. In this scenario, a Christian owes another some wine or pork.
Subsequently, the two parties become Muslims, which means that the wine and pork are no
longer of value. Baha’u’llah argues that a judge hearing the case would have to order that the
debt be repaid in the equivalent of goods lawful under Islam or in cash. The example
illustrates the same point, this time showing how the debt changes in form from wine or pork
to something lawful in Islam. But the right is not extinguished by the fact that the two parties
change their religion. It persists through these changes in circumstances. The scenario seems
to underscore the fact that a person’s rights are not annulled by a change in religious law due
to the appearance of a new dispensation.

            Tablet on the Right of the People (Lawḥ-i ḥaqq al-nās)

by Bahā’u’llāh

Translated by Keven Brown

In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.

Praise be to God, who has fulfilled what He revealed to all of His prophets
and His messengers, and announced to all people the glad tidings of His days.
Among them is the day He promised us in His incorruptible book with the words:
the day when “God will provide for each out of His abundance.”1 That day, in
truth, is this day, for He has provided for all who have entered beneath His shelter
in this day from the wealth of His knowledge and His wisdom, in such wise that
He has entrusted the reins of knowledge into the hands of His most insignificant
servant, and the care of His humblest subject, who holds fast to the cord of His
love during the days of His revelation.

Praise be to God, who inspires whom He desires with the hosts of His
revelation and casts the light of His knowledge into the hearts of whom He pleases.
No God is there but Him, who is so manifest through the manifestation of Himself
that He has no veil except the light of His beauty and no cover besides the
profusion of His manifestation.

Blessings and peace be on His most honored friend and the prince of His
creation,2 and on his family and his supporters, who have arisen at his bidding and
remained steadfast in his love.

\[1\] Qurʿān 4:130.

\[2\] Probably a reference to the prophet Muḥammad, though possibly to the Bāb. According to Armin Eshraghi, this
type of ambiguity can often be observed in Bahāʾuʾllāh’s writings and is generally done on purpose.

Your letter was read, and it is the source of gladness and joy. God willing,
this blessing may always be our companion and this confirmation continue, if from
time to time you would inquire about, and have compassion for, the state of those
who wander in the wilderness of disappointment and humiliation.3 May God
recompense you with the best of rewards and confirm you in that which He pleases
and desires.

You have asked how the administration of justice in the world after death
and the requital of the rights of the people during the Great Resurrection, which is
known as the Day of Judgment,4 should be understood and conceived, given that
these worldly adornments, possessions, and legal rights sought after in this vain
life do not exist in the worlds after death. And even supposing they did exist, they
would yield no profit and bear no fruit for those to whom they are due. Therefore,
how can justice be said to be administered in those worlds? For instance, it is said
that God is merciful and may sometimes waive what is due to Him and grant His
pardon, but He does not waive the rights of the people, so they may receive what is
justly theirs.

O beloved of my heart! You have asked about a matter that is very abstruse
and difficult to explain, for understanding this question depends on understanding
and comprehending the days after death and on true knowledge of the Day of
Resurrection. Comprehending these two mysteries requires a pure heart and a
sanctified ear, and not every ear is worthy of hearing this divine glad tiding. How
can the ear that does not hear the blast of the trumpet and the sound of the horn
coming from the heaven of this Revelation still hear the singing of the birds? But,
since I am compelled to answer your request, I will respond with brevity and limit
myself to setting forth certain comparisons and likenesses. There is no power or
strength except in God, the Incomparable, the All-Compelling.

\[3\] Armin Eshraghi explains that Bahāʾuʾllāh is here applying conventions of modesty expected in Persian letter
writing: that the addressee has thought of the unworthy writer, namely, Bahāʾuʾllāh, is a great blessing and a token
of his goodwill.

\[4\] According to common Muslim belief, after bodily death the human soul resides in an intermediate world before the
event of the Great Resurrection. Shaykh Aḥmad describes the Great Resurrection as the moment souls are
summoned to appear before God in celestial archetypal bodies by the second blast of the archangel Seraphiel’s
trumpet, after which they receive God’s judgment and obtain their just due, whether this be reward or punishment.
(See H. Corbin, Spiritual Body and Celestial Earth, pp. 191-195.) The Islamic principle of ḥaqq al-nās (the right of
the people) asserts that in the next world souls will receive compensation for the debts owed to them.

I submit, therefore, that whatever is seen and heard in this temporal world,
this world of limitations—of every name and description, of every form and
attribute—also has a presence and manifestation in every world of the worlds of
God suitable to and befitting that world, where it appears and is revealed by
another name and description, and in another form with other attributes. The death
of things witnessed in this world applies to the form and the body only, not to the
reality and the essence.5 Without a doubt, the realities of things appear in different
guises and have diverse manifestations in every world, and countless realities are
revealed in every world.

Those mature philosophers who have drunk the choice wine of true
understanding have acknowledged the embodiment of deeds. 6 The All-Glorious
states: “He will requite them for their [acquired] attributes (waṣf).”7 The Dayspring
of the Revelation of the All-Merciful has declared: “The people will be requited for
their deeds, with reward being the consequence of good deeds and punishment the
consequence of wrongdoing.” It is evident, then, that deeds will be preserved and
every [acquired] attribute will continue to exist, so that through the attribute or
deed itself requital can be given. Every [acquired] attribute a person possesses and
every deed he commits, therefore, will reveal itself and take on a particular form in

\[5\] In Aristotelian philosophy, the essence and reality of “triangleness,” for example, is having three sides and three
angles whose sum adds up to 180 degrees. These attributes cannot be removed from a triangle without destroying its
fundamental nature. But any acquired accidental attributes, like being red or being dense, can be added or removed,
as they are not essential to its nature. In the same way, the essential nature of “humanness” is having a rational mind,
while accidental attributes, like being just or being oppressive, are not essential to the reality of man.

\[6\] In his Sharḥ-i-Golshan-Rāz, al-Lāhījī explains that the term tajassum-i-aʿmāl, which Bahā’u’llāh uses here, refers
to the embodiment of human deeds on the day of resurrection after death: “After the separation of the soul from the
physical body, man will possess an ideal spiritual body (jism maʿnawī mithālī) devoid of any corporeal darkness or
density. That ‘body’ is like crystal clear water, and whatever passes before it appears and becomes reflected in it. He
will witness again in that mirror all of his deeds and actions distinguished and represented in appropriate images.
Eventually, all the acts, deeds, and attributes preserved and firmly embedded in the soul, by reason of the removal of
the dark veils of the body and nature, will become manifest in the ideal inter-world portrayed in befitting images, for
that is a world wherein the manifest and the hidden are the same, and all things become revealed” (qtd. in Farhang-
i-Iṣṭilāḥāt-i-ʿIrfānī, p. 222).

\[7\] Qurʾān 6:139. The verb translated here as “requite” (jazā) has the double implied meaning of “to reward” or “to
punish”, depending on whether the deed being requited is good or bad. The context of this passage makes it clear
that God, in this case, is saying He will punish these people for their wrongdoings (= shameful acquired attributes)
and for their false assertions. The term waṣf, as a synonym for ṣifa, means “attribute,” “characteristic,” “trait,” or
“property”). It also has the meaning of “description,” “depiction,” “representation,” etc., as well as “attribution” and
“ascription,”, so the verse in question could also be translated “He will requite them for their [false] attribution,” as
some Qurʾān translators have done.

each world “so that He may requite each soul for what it has done. He, indeed, is
swift in calling to account.”8

Whenever we desire to make statements and give analogies that are easy to
understand and comprehend, in order to explain this theme and expound on the
nature of the manifestations of things in the innumerable worlds, I consider no
analogy more befitting than that of the dream world. It is said that “sleep is the
brother of death,”9 so may you recognize the brother by the likeness of his brother.
Consider how in the world of vision you see certain things, and later while awake
in this world, you interpret and explain them by referring to other names, forms,
and representations. Then after a lapse of time, something very similar to what you
interpreted and explained is witnessed.

Therefore, O my brother, when you dream and see such a thing in the world
of vision, it will have another name and attribute there different from that which it
has here. Recognize, then, that this same difference in forms applies to the world
after death. And know of a certainty that while the reality and the essence are one,
the form and the representation will vary.

If you are unable to grasp this theme through your own experience, then
refer to the interpretations of the wise among those who interpret dreams, for they
have an interpretation for every statement and every action, and for each thing they
have an explanation. The most truthful of speakers, in His book, mentions Joseph’s
vision (upon him and the Lord of our age be peace) and his interpretation of the
dreams of two other individuals.10 Now consider. What kind of world is that
wherein his father and mother are seen as the sun and the moon, and his brothers
appear in the form of stars? And what is this world wherein the reverse is seen: the
sun and the moon in the form of his father and mother, and the stars in the form of
his brothers? He says (exalted be his sovereignty), “I saw eleven stars, and the sun
and the moon; I saw them bowing down before me.”11 The interpretation of this

\[10\] See Qurʾān 12:4–5 and 12:36 ff.

\[11\] Qurʾān 12:4.

vision became clear once Joseph was established upon the throne of glory, and
Jacob and Joseph’s eleven brothers prostrated themselves at his feet.

Now, since this question has become established and ascertained, it is
evident that the rendering of each due takes place in every world in a manner
befitting that world. Otherwise, assuredly the administration of justice could not be
fulfilled.

I will set forth another analogy for you that, by this means, you may more
easily comprehend the topic of our discourse and realize your aim. Suppose that
during the season of spring someone should steal the seeds and grains of another
individual and then plant those seeds in his own garden, so that after a time they
grow into tender young bushes, and, finally, during the summer season, they are
ready for harvest. Then it happens that a just king, during this same summer
season, desires to redress the injustice done to the wronged one. What will his
course of action be? Will he take steps to replace the lost seeds or grains, or will he
return the shrubs themselves with their fruit on them?

Certainly, you would say the bushes, even though this form is not the same
as that form, and this name and this attribute are unlike the name and the attribute
the seeds had in the spring. Perhaps you would assert that those same seeds and
grains no longer exist in the summer season. And assuming they did exist and the
very same seeds could be returned, this would provide no benefit or gain to their
owner, for the season of spring, which is the time of planting, has already passed,
and the seeds and grains would be of no use.

However, it is clearly incorrect to say that the seeds no longer exist and
provide no benefit, for in truth and fact, those seeds and grains do exist and have
appeared in the form of the bushes and their fruit, which are superior and more
valuable.

How often it happens that justice is dispensed in this very world while you
remain unaware. Such is the case when one’s adornments and possessions become
the cloak of tests and afflictions, and tests and afflictions appear in the form of
possessions. Often it happens that the loss of these possessions is the reason and
cause for dispelling one’s afflictions. In this case, there is no distinction between
losing one’s possessions through spiritual causes and losing them through the

oppression of another. Although the oppressor has seized and stolen your property,
he has also removed the cause of your affliction and brought it on himself. Is any
better method of dispensing justice conceivable? No, by the Lord of the worlds!

Were I to explain and remove the veil from the manifestations of the deeds,
acts, and words that appear in limitless and manifold forms in the worlds of God, it
is feared, on the one hand, that sanctified souls would forsake their bodies and
ascend to the seats of the glory of the All-Merciful; and, on the other, that the
wicked and perverse would perish out of fear for what they have committed during
their futile lives.

How I long for spiritual attributes, goodly deeds, and truthful and beneficial
words! For the outcome of these is an upraised heaven, an outspread earth, rising
suns, gleaming moons, scintillating stars, crystal fountains, flowing rivers, gentle
breezes, sublime palaces, lofty trees, heavenly fruits, rich harvests,12 warbling
birds, crimson leaves, and perfumed blossoms. Thus I say: “Protect me, protect me,
O my Lord, the All-Merciful, from blameworthy attributes, wicked deeds,
unseemly acts, and deceitful and injurious words!” For the outcome of these is
realized in the contingent realm as hell and hellfire, and the infernal and fetid
trees,13 as utter malevolence, loathsome things, sicknesses, misery, pollution, and
war and destruction. Great God! To disclose more than this is not permissible. I
declare that all majesty and greatness belong to God, the Incomparable, the All-
Compelling.

I will present another example from the realm of divine legislation, which
corresponds to the world of creation, by referring to the application of religious
law. God willing, to the extent you are informed of the divine worlds, you will
recognize and understand the metaphorical nature of this world, and will be able to
extend it to the limitless worlds. I relate a parable from the religious law of Islām
and the law preceding it, of which you are aware and which you acknowledge.
Should a Christian, in accordance with religious law and ordinance, owe a jar of
wine and a piece of pork to a debtor, and later on both should become Muslims,
what course should the deputies of the sacred law follow in order to redress the

\[12\] Literally, “low hanging bunches of grapes,” a Qurʾanic image of Paradise, see sūras 69:23, 76:14.

\[13\] The trees of Zaqqūm and Ẓarīʿ, the fruits of which are said to be more bitter than aloe, more fetid than carrion,
and hotter than fire, which are the food of the inmates of hell.

right of the wronged and requite the overdue debt owed to him? For in Islām, wine
and pork are unlawful and have no value, and will yield no benefit to the one to
whom they are due. You have no recourse except to say: either they should
compensate the creditor with goods that are lawful in Islām, or they should award
him its monetary value in conformity with what legal experts consider equitable
and fair. Similar judgments in some legal cases are mentioned and recorded in the
books of the jurists.

Should I desire it, I could unfold for you many more analogies, both
common and abstruse. Through the power of God and His might, I am able to do
this. But I refrain from this lest our discourse become protracted and cause you to
become weary and inattentive. Thus, I conclude this discourse and give praise to
God, who has guided us to recognize His Most Great Name and has acquainted us
with that whereof the peoples of the world are unaware.
