## Tablet of Visitation for Vahid-i Darabi

### by [Bahá'u'lláh](https://bahai-library.com/author/Bahá'u'lláh)

translated by [Ahang Rabbani](https://bahai-library.com/author/Ahang%20Rabbani).  
originally revealed as "Lawh-i-Ziyarát-i-Vahíd-i-Darabí".


For his holiness Vahid hath this been revealed, he who beheld the Countenance of God, the All-Glorious, the Almighty, and who in His path sacrificed himself, arose to serve His Cause and quaffed his fill of the draught of certitude from the Hand of his Lord, the Munificent.

"He is supreme over His Cause  
and powerful over His creation."

The first wave of exaltation from the ocean of grace of thy Lord, the Compassionate, be upon thee \[Vahid\] who art the essence of the Qur'an and possessor of the mysteries of the Bayan.

I testify that thou drank of the choice wine of His Revelation from the hand of His favor and grace, and attained the presence of Him Who was the Promised One in all the sacred Books, Scriptures and Tablets. Thou didst hearken unto the divine Call when raised and perceived its manifestation above the Exalted horizon on a Day when all the dwellers of the mortal kingdom rejected the Creator of the heavens. Thou hast, moreover, discerned the Most Great Announcement and inhaled the fragrance of the garment of the Lord of Days.

I testify that thou rendered victorious the Faith of God and His Cause through thy pen, thy tongue and thy hand until thou didst surrender thy life in His path and quaffed from the Kawthar (heavenly fountain) of self-renunciation in His name and in His love. Thou wast intoxicated from the spring of His Recognition and hath soared with the wings of certitude in the heaven of the murmur of thy God, the Lord of Grandeur. Over thy sufferings have all the atoms of the earth cried and the eye of creation wept.

I testify that because of thee all the treasures of earth appeared and all the pearls of sea were revealed. Through thee, the pinnacle of understanding was adorned with the crown of revelation. Thou art the one who accepted the choice sealed wine in the presence of all and drank thy fill in the Name of thy Lord, the Ancient of Days.

May the resplendent glory which hath dawned from the horizon of divine grace, and effulgent light from the heaven of sanctified justice, rest upon thee and upon those who have assisted thee. For they accepted the One that thou had accepted and repudiated those who had risen against thee. With thee and under thy shadow, they rendered the Cause victorious, having beheld thee and circled around thee.

O God, my God, creator of me and of the heavens, I beseech Thee by the pearls of the ocean of Thy Oneness, by the mysteries of Thy Book, and by lamentation of Thy loved ones in their separation from Thee, and by the tears of the pure ones on their remoteness from Thee, I invoke thee, O Thou Lord of indomitable Strength, by this sacred Tomb and by this exalted Shrine \[Vahid's\], to forgive me and my father, and all those who for Thy sake have approach these sacred remains, and all those who have come and will come on pilgrimage to this spot.

O my God, I beseech Thee by him \[Vahid\] and those who have suffered martyrdom in Thy path to grant me and to those who remain faithful in Thy Covenant, the necessities of life. Thou art the All-knowing, the All-wise, Sovereign of creation.
