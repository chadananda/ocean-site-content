#### Chapter 1

### On the Two Loves _‘Ishq-i-Majázi wa ‘Ishq-i-Haqíqí_ 

**_O_** ye lovers of the Abhá Beauty! When the thoughts of those attached to the contingent world become attracted to the colours and physical beauty in this world of dust they become so enamoured of it that they are ready to give their life for it. They forget themselves and will billow forth like unto the ocean. They seek neither a settled life, nor comfort nor rest. Every eventide they are tearful in love and every dawn they burn with longing. Consider if this is the condition of those in love with contingent and ephemeral things what then must be the state of those who are lovers of the True Beloved and what cries of ardour and love must ascend from their hearts. If the love of the world of dust can cause such ardour and ecstasy then it is should be obvious what the love of the Spirit of sanctity will achieve. This day is the day that the lovers of the Abhá Beauty must needs show self-sacrifice and haste to the field of martyrdom in His love. They must vouchsafe the spirit of life and kindle the lamp of the Merciful One. They must sing the accents of ‘Iráq and the melodies of Hijáz so that hearts may be moved and souls may be quickened and all spirits may be animated by spiritual vitality. Thereby will a divine celebration be set up and the banquet of the love of God be in full swing so that the melodies of that joyous assembly and the chants and songs of those peerless gatherings may reach the heights of the divine empyrean and the denizens of the Concourse on high may become joyful and exhilarated.

### On the Radiance of the Innermost Reality of Man _Núrániyyat-i-Haqíqat Insániyyah_ 

**O** ye friends of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’!\[1\]

**A**lthough some time is gone since, with pen and ink, I have corresponded with you, yet, in the world of spirit and the heart, at all times I am in communion with those friends of the Abhá Beauty. I have not forgotten them for a moment and I have not rested for the duration of a single breath. With the utmost supplication and imploring, I have prayed that those friends of the All Merciful God may be protected from the ailment of body and soul in all conditions and circumstances, and that they may be confirmed to demonstrate by their deeds and words that these wronged ones are enamoured of the Abhá Beauty and attracted to the fragrances of holiness wafting from the Concourse on High, proving thereby that their utterance, their expositions, their characteristics and conduct, their virtues and perfections are all emanations of the Light of Immortality and the effulgences of the Most Great Name. My point is that the inner reality of man must, like unto a mirror, radiate light shone upon it by the rays of the Sun of Truth. Otherwise, the human reality is as a black stone and is darkness upon darkness. Now the rays of the Sun of Truth are divine recognition, belief, certitude, assurance, attraction, attraction, enkindlement, and persistence in spreading the divine fragrances.  
  
O ye servants of God! These days will fast elapse. Sovereigns and vassals both will be forgotten. There will be no trace, no sign, no leaf, and no result remaining of them. All will be the manifestations of the blessed verse, &38220;Hath there not been over Man a long period of Time when he was nothing — (not even) mentioned?”\[2\] except for those servants who were utterly wary of self and desire and became the dawning place of the lights of guidance, the focal point of the divine mysteries, and the leading lights of the righteous ones. These are resplendent like a brilliant star shining over the horizon of truth until eternity. Strive ye therefore that ye may drink of the wine of utmost constancy and with great strength may withstand the heedless ones and if all the peoples of the world should unite against you be not afraid or weak and rely on the hosts of the Kingdom of God. Do not seek the comfort of a few transient days; rather look at the end of all things. Consider in whose deeds and conduct resides praiseworthy consequences? This meditation will teach us lessons and lead us to the truth of the matter.  
  
O my God! O my God! These souls are thy servants, humble before Thy gate, indigent in thy presence, feeble before Thy face; ordain for them all good and protect them from all harm. Enable them to become the protectors of thy impregnable stronghold and shepherds of thy flock in those regions and capable of hurling the darts of thy authority against the breakers of thy covenant with the power of thy sovereignty and clear proofs so that they may rise with the utmost strength to raise Thy word in that far distant country. O my Lord! These souls are like unto weak birds; make them to become eagles, soaring in the heights of Thy bounty, and falcons of grace and integrity and protect them from the oppressor. Thou art verily the Omnipotent, the Bounteous One. Verily, Thou art the Mighty, the Help in peril, the Exalted!

#### Chapter 3

### On Purification and the Attributes of the Mirrors _Sifát wa Tasfiyah-yi-Maráya_ 

**_O_** daughter of the Kingdom!\[1\] Thy letter was received its contents were appreciated. It was evidence of thy supplication and prayers and proof of thy attraction and ardour in the cause of God. How great is thy blessedness that thou hast attained this station and this steadfastness!  
  
O thou daughter of the kingdom! The Lord of the kingdom, the Sun of Truth, shone a radiance and an effulgent light unto all the world and the universe and all beings obtained the light of life from it. All came into true existence because of it. All existent things are like the pages of a mirror upon which the Sun of Truth shines, its grace is the one grace, its effulgence is the one effulgence but the mirrors are different and diverse. Some mirrors are in the utmost purity and delicacy and reflect fully the rays of the Sun of Truth and the sun shines most clearly in them, but other mirrors are clouded by dust and dross and so are deprived of deriving proper grace. The beloved of God are perfect clean mirrors that reflect the light of the luminary of the world completely. Others are like unto stone and sand and are veiled from it. This is especially the case of those who show hatred and enmity, oppression, wrong-doing and blind fanaticism. Such people are so clouded over that they are like a black stone upon which the light of the sun has no radiance or reflection. Now these mirrors who are deprived should not be alienated, estranged and considered as the enemy or as savage and untrainable, but rather, with the utmost love and kindness, one should consider them as members of the human family and recognise them as acquaintances and not treat them as the estranged one. Look upon them as friends and educate them; show them sympathy and consolation. Lead them towards spiritual qualities so that all dust and clouds be removed from the face of the mirrors and the lights of the Sun of Truth may shine brilliantly.  
  
O daughter of the Kingdom! Beware, beware, lest ye be estranged from anyone, even though he be most savage and negligent of God; rather one should seek at all times oneness, freedom from hate so that all the hate, rancour, animosity, oppression, injustice and calumnies may be totally obliterated, so that the world may become the Abhá paradise and the universe may be transformed into the All-Glorious (_Abhá_) paradise and that the human race may be transferred into angelic beings and its members, the manifestations of the grace of the most Glorious Lord. In this lies the bounty of the world of humanity and in this consists the guidance ordained by the Lord of sanctity.  
  
O daughter of the Kingdom! thou has written about the holding of meetings in Buffalo that thou art engaged in teaching in those meetings; if you should show steadfastness and do not show fatigue and apathy, truly the Sun of Truth will shine upon all those regions and territories.  
  
O daughter of the kingdom! Show the greatest respect and honour to the poor ones, the orphans and the disabled from every country, tribe and people. Show the utmost loving kindness to them like a true servant serve them, treat them as honourable and dignified people and consider yourself their servant night and day.

#### Chapter 4

### On Servitude _Dar Ma’níy-i-‘Ubudiyyat_ 

**O** thou that dost serve at the divine Threshold!\[1\] This service of thine is higher than the sovereignty of the world. This servitude thou dost offer is better than if thou didst rule over all. For earthly power is as vapour in deserted wildernesses, nay worse: it is as deadly venom. But the service thou dost render gives thee lasting sway; it is the rule of high heaven. Well hath it been said:

> These are slaves but kings shall be their thralls,  
> And the universe would fain become their servant.\[2\]

Know thou, that this garment of servitude is a robe of everlasting glory on thy shoulders and this dust is a diadem worthy of princes in the Realm of eternity.  
  
It is for this same reason that the treasured crown of this lowly one is to be a servant at the threshold of the Abhá Beauty and my greatest glory is to attain this station of thraldom. O my God! Strengthen me in this purpose and enable me to realise this hope. Thou art verily the Confirmer, the All-Powerful.
