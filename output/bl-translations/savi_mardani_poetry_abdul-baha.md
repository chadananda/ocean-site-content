Introduction

As Shoghi Effendi pointed out in a letter written on his
behalf to an individual on 3 February 1952, “the Prophets of
God do not teach the arts,” which are “an expression of the
people” [qtd. in CC3:31, no.63]. However, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who

492                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Himself wrote a number of poems in Persian and in Turkish,
has left good guidance on the issue of poetry, and any aspiring
poet or reader of poetry would benefit from becoming familiar
with His words. An early study of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s poems has
been published in Persian, under the title of “The poems by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá (Ash‘ár-i-Óa∂rát-i-‘Abdu’l-Bahá),” by Behrouz
Jabbari, an Iranian Bahá’í scholar residing in Canada, in
Khúshihá’íy-i-az kharman-i-adab va khwanar 14:281-300.
Jabbari quotes nine poems in Persian as well as three in Turkish,
while mentioning that the number of Turkish poems ascribed to
the Master is a little higher. He writes that a letter from the
Research Department of the Universal House of Justice, whose
date and addressee he does not mention, lists only 8 poems by
the Master. The present authors also found a tenth poem, which
is part of a Tablet, published in Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 13:141-3
and in Makátíb 1:414. Jabbari’s paper gives the sources of the
poems, except for one of them, but does not mention the
circumstances of their composition. For most poems, he gives a
short commentary on its formal features. He translates into
Persian two of the three Turkish poems and four verses of the
third one. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Persian poems that we have found in
the available Persian literature are as follows, listed in the order
adopted by Jabbari:
1. Sínáy-i-Óaqq pur núr shud (12 verses), which may be

> paraphrased as “The Sinai of God was filled with light”
> [Jabbárí 289-90];

2. Ay Gul-rukh-i-Abháy-i-man! (18 verses), which may be

> paraphrased as “O my Abhá rose-cheek” [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb
> 55:340-2; Muntakhabátí az Makatíb 2:17, Jabbarí 290-1];

3. Ay Khudáy-i-Pur-‘A†áy-i-Dhu’l-Manán (8 verses), which

> may paraphrased as “O God of all graces and Lord of all
bounties” [SWAB 202, sec. 174] [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 13:411-2;

> Majmú‘iy-i-Munájáthá 135-7; Munájáthá 51-2; Adhkáru’l-Muqarrabín
2:135; Jabbari 291-2];

Jabbari describes this poem as a prayer
and a mathnaví (see below);
Poetry in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Writings and Utterances                       493

4. ˆn ˙alq-i-Bahá dar ˙alqih fitád (9 verses), which may be

> paraphrased as “This flock of Bahá was ensnared”
> [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 21:234; Munájáthá 19-20; Rafati, Ma’ákhidh 2:239,
Jabbari 292];

this poem is sometimes considered a prayer;
Jabbari describes it as a ghazal (see below);
5. Dast-i-karam bi-gushá (12 verses), which may be

> paraphrased as “Draw forth the hand of generosity”
> [Majmú‘iy-i-Munáját 18-9, Jabbari 292-3];

6. Núr-i-hudá tábán shudih (8 verses), which may be

> paraphrased as “The light of guidance shines” [Majmú‘iy-i-
> Makátíb 13:205-6; Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 88:312; Muntakhabátí az
> Makátíb 2:18, Jabbari 293];

7. Sham‘-i-shabistán-i-Óaqq (9 verses), which may be

> paraphrased as “O torch in the Divine chapel” [Majmú‘iy-i-
> Makátíb 13:203-4; Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 55:237-9; Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb
> 88:55-6;   Majmú‘iy-i-Munáját   49-50;   Jabbari   293-4];   Jabbari
> describes it as a ghazal (see below);
8. Anvár-i-Óaqq rukhshán shudih (17 verses), that may be

> paraphrased as “The lights of God glisten” [Majmú‘iy-i-
> Makátíb 13:207-8; Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 55:132-5; Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb
> 88:313; Jabbari 294];

9. Ay murdiy-i-bí-ján-u dil (9 verses), which may be

> paraphrased as “O thou who art lifeless in your heart and
> soul” [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 13:206; Muntakhabátí az Makátíb 4:139,
> Jabbari 295]; Jabbari writes that this poem is not mentioned
> in the above mentioned letter by the Research Department
> of the Universal House of Justice;
10. ˆn ‘Ahd-i-Alast ast ín (3 verses, in a short Tablet), which

> may be paraphrased as “This is the Day of the Eternal
> Covenant” [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 13:142-3, Makátíb 1:414; this poem
> is not recorded in Jabbárí’s paper].

As far as we know, only the second verse of poem no. 7 has
been authoritatively translated into English [see SWAB 270, sec.

494                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

218].In this paper we propose our own paraphrases of a few of
the verses authored by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá mentions in His Writings and utterances at
least seven aspects of poetry: inspiration, beauty, eloquence, a
versified language, novelty, expressivity, depth and loftiness of
meanings. He moreover sets forth clear concepts on the
purposes of poetry. We will now examine these aspects of
poetry in the light of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s poems.

Inspiration

Inspiration has been described as: “A special immediate
action or influence of the Spirit of God ... upon the human
mind or soul” [OED 7:1036]. It also has been defined as:

> A sudden enlightenment of the spirit, which appears as a
> guidance for one’s behavior emerging from unknown
> depths of one’s personality and coordinating past and
> future experience through intuitive ways ... Influence
> exerted by God upon a person, who is enlightened in his
> mind, spurred in his will, directed and sustained in his
> action, for the attainment of a supernatural goal ... an
> impulsion (considered of divine origin or arising from a
> mysterious force or an inner wealth) which ... leads a
> person, in a sort of enrapture or creative ecstasy, to
> translate circumstances, impressions, feelings, etc. into
> works of art. [Battaglia 8:593]

‘Abdu’l-Bahá explained that “inspiration” is the “influx” [PUP
22] or “the promptings or susceptibilities of the human heart”
[PUP 254]. He added that the human heart may be influenced
both by “satanic” and “divine promptings” [PUP 251] The former
ones, which He also calls “imagination” [ibid.], come from our
lower self. The latter ones are a “prompting of the heart
through the merciful assistance” [PUP 254]. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also
says that imagination “can only picture that which it is able to
create” [PT 11, 5.6], that it is “accidental (or non-essential)” [TAB

Poetry in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Writings and Utterances                  495

3:562],limited and often at odds with reality. Therefore He
seemingly uses the term “imagination” in these contexts as “a
creative power of the mind that conceives dreams, illusions,
abstractions, fictitious and bizarre forms, activities of idle
thinking, of conjecturing” [Battaglia 7:342]. He wrote that we can
differentiate between “inspiration” and “imagination,” because
“inspiration is in conformity with the Divine Texts, but
imaginations do not conform therewith” [TAB 1:195]. Another
difference is that the ideas “which owe their source to the Light
of Truth will be realized in the outward world; while others of a
different origin vanish, come and go like waves on the sea of
imagination and find no realization in the world of existence”
[TAB 2:301]. In this context, we could say that poems written
under the impulse of imagination do not give fruits, that is,
they are not able to raise noble feelings and thoughts in the
souls of their readers.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá said that inspiration may be received “during
meditation” [PT 187, sec. 54, para. 11]. He also wrote: “when the
heart becometh confident, the imagination of Satan and evil
vanisheth away. If the heart becometh absolutely tranquil,
suspicion and imagination will entirely pass away” [TAB 1:104].
He explained this concept in detail:

> if thy mind becomes empty and pure from every
> mention and thought and thy heart attracted wholly to
> the Kingdom of God, forgets all else besides God and
> comes in communion with the Spirit of God, then the
> Holy Spirit will assist thee with a power which will
> enable thee to penetrate all things, and a Dazzling Spark
> which enlightens all sides, a Brilliant Flame in the zenith
> of the heavens, will teach thee that which thou dost not
> know of the facts of the universe and of the divine
> doctrine. [TAB 3:706]

And finally He described the condition of a person who
receives inspiration from the Holy Spirit:

496                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

> A real, spiritual connection between the True One and
> the servant is a luminous bounty which causeth an
> ecstatic ... flame, passion and attraction. When this
> connection is secured ... such an ecstasy and happiness
> become manifest in the heart that man doth fly away
> (with joy) and uttereth melody and song. Just as the soul
> bringeth the body in motion, so that spiritual bounty
> and real connection likewise moveth (or cheereth) the
> human soul. [TAB 1:195]

Shoghi Effendi explained, in a letter written on his behalf to
two believers on 25 January 1943, that inspiration “can be
received through meditation” and that “God can inspire into
our minds things that we had no previous knowledge of, if He
desires to do so” [qtd. in CC2:241, no.1771]. He also made clear, in a
letter written on his behalf to an individual believer on 19
November 1945, that “we cannot say that any inspiration which
a person, not knowing Bahá’u’lláh, or not believing in God,
receives is merely from his own ego” [qtd. in CC2:241, no.1774].

‘Abdu’l-Bahá repeatedly described art as the fruit of
inspiration. Sara Lady Blomfield (1859–1939), one of the
earliest Bahá’ís in the British Isles, writes that He said that “All
Art is a gift of the Holy Spirit. When this light shines through
the mind of a musician, it manifests itself in beautiful
harmonies. Again, shining through the mind of a poet, it is seen
in fine poetry and poetic prose. When the Light of the Sun of
Truth inspires the mind of a painter, he produces marvelous
pictures” [qtd. in CH 167]. Moreover ‘Abdu’l-Bahá reportedly
said: “when you breathe forth the breath of the Holy Spirit
from your hearts into the world ... [a]ll arts and sciences will
become revealed and the knowledge of God will be manifested.
It is not your work but that of the Holy Spirit which you
breathe forth through the Word” [qtd. in Rabb 103].1 A key to a
better understanding of the guidance given by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as
to poetical inspiration may be found in the following Tablet
addressed by Him to a hesitant poet:

Poetry in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Writings and Utterances                 497

O thou who art uttering the mention of God!

Know, that the pure hearts upon which the mysteries
> of the Kingdom of God are printed and pictured, are
> reflections one upon another and thus the one can
> discover the secrets of the other, because such hearts are
> only mirrors confronting each other on which the
> secrets of unity, affinity and concord are printed and
> reflected. Accordingly, it would be possible that a
> certain servant of the servants of the Merciful might
> discover a treasured mystery or a preserved sign,
> whatever his shortcomings or defects might be; yet we
> do indeed rely upon God the Forgiver. I supplicate Him
> to deliver us from the pangs of lust and its dangers and
> from the destructive conditions of passion.

Verily, I do testify that thine heart is moved by the
> fragrance of the love of God, that thy memory is a
> fountain overflowing with the water of the knowledge
> of God. Therefore, finish the poem which thou art
> composing and send it here, that through reading it the
> breast of the believers may be refreshed and dilated with
> joy. [TAB 3:669]

‘Abdu’l-Bahá uses in this Tablet the versatile metaphor of
light and mirrors. He describes pure hearts as mirrors capable
of reflecting “the mysteries of the Kingdom of God” [ibid.]. And
thus both poets and readers, if they are pure-hearted, may be
described as mirrors, and light may be reflected from the poets
to the readers and vice-versa. Abdu’l-Bahá writes that “it would
be possible that a certain servant of the servants of the
Merciful might discover a treasured mystery or a preserved
sign, whatever his shortcomings or defects might be” [ibid.].
However, as Bahá’u’lláh writes, the light’s “appearance in every
mirror is conditioned by the colour of that mirror” [qtd. in
CC3:19, no.22]. And thus the poet should try to be delivered
“from the pangs of lust and its dangers and from the

498                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

destructive conditions of passion” [TAB 3:669], so that his heart
may be purified. Then his heart will be “moved by the fragrance
of the love of God,” and his “memory” will be “a fountain
overflowing with the water of the knowledge of God,” and he
will be able to write poems whereby “the breast of the believers
may be refreshed and dilated with joy” [ibid.]. In other words,
the poet’s earnest struggle toward spiritual perfection is the
soundest guarantee that his poems may be inspired and thus
capable of inspiring their readers with noble ideas and feelings.

As to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s poems, He has been described by
Shoghi Effendi in the following exalted terms:

> Bahá’u’lláh’s ... most exalted handiwork, the stainless
> Mirror of His light, the perfect Exemplar of His
> teachings, ... the embodiment of every Bahá’í ideal, the
> incarnation of every Bahá’í virtue ... the Being “round
> Whom all names revolve,” ... the “Mystery of God” —
> an expression by which Bahá’u’lláh Himself has chosen
> to designate Him, and which, while it does not by any
> means justify us to assign to Him the station of
> Prophethood, indicates how in the person of ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá the incompatible characteristics of a human nature
> and superhuman knowledge and perfection have been
> blended and are completely harmonized. [WOB 133]

And thus His poems may also be expected to convey “the
incompatible characteristics of a human nature and superhuman
knowledge and perfection ... blended and ... completely
harmonized” [WOB 133].

Beauty

Guidance as to what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá meant by “beautiful
words” [TAB 1:58] may be found in several passages of His
works. The following words are an example:

Poetry in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Writings and Utterances                  499

> Verily, I chanted thy poem. Its significance was
> beautiful, its composition eloquent and its words
> excellent….
> …thou hast uttered the praise of thy Lord and expressed
> significant meanings in eulogy of thy Lord, the
> Merciful, the Clement….
> Verily, I read thy poem, which contained new
> significances and beautiful words. My heart was dilated
> by its eloquent sense. I prayed God to make thee utter
> more beautiful compositions than this….
> Chant the verses of guidance among the people and
> commence [the composition of] melodies of great
> beauty and effect in praise and glorification of the
> Generous Lord…
> Thy little book of poems, which were very sweet, was
> read. It was a source of joy, for it was a spiritual
> anthem and a melody of the love of God.
> Continue as long as thou canst this melody in the
> gatherings of the beloved; thus may the minds find rest
> and joy and become in tune with the love of God. When
> eloquence of expression, beauty of sense and sweetness
> of composition unite with new melodies the effect is
> ever great, especially if it be the anthem of the verses of
> oneness and the songs of praise to the Lord of Glory.
> Endeavor your utmost to compose beautiful poems to
> be chanted with heavenly music; thus may their beauty
> affect the minds and impress the hearts of those who
> listen. (TAB 1:57-9]

He wrote to a poet: “Endeavor, so far as it is possible for
thee, that day by day thou mayest string the pearls of poesy
with sweeter rhythm and more eloquent contents, in order that
it may become conducive to the perpetuity of thy name in the
spiritual meetings” [TAB 3:546]. He is reported to have said
moreover: “What is poetry? It is a symmetrical collection of

500                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

words,” and “it is natural for the heart and spirit to take
pleasure and enjoyment in all things that show forth symmetry,
harmony, and perfection” [qtd. in Lucas 12]. He also referred to
the “elegant ... context” [TAB 3:546] of a poem. He finally
mentioned “sweetness of composition” [TAB 1:59] as well as, in
His Tablet to Marie Watson,2 “delicacy” [qtd. in “Tablets to Bahá’ís”
307]. Therefore rhythm, symmetry, harmony, elegance,
sweetness, delicacy and perfection are among the prerequisites
of the beauty of a poem that have been mentioned by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. It may be useful transcribing a few definitions of these
words from the most renowned English dictionaries and reflect
on their meanings.

Rhythm is defined as

> The measured flow of words or phrases ... Due
> correlation and interdependence of parts, producing a
> harmonious whole ... The measured recurrence of arsis
> and thesis determined by vowel-quantity or stress, or
> both combined; kind of metrical movement, as
> determined by the relation of long and short, or stressed
> and unstressed, syllables in a foot or a line. [OED 13:874]

Symmetry is defined as

> Due or just proportion; harmony of parts with each
> other and the whole; fitting, regular, or balanced
> arrangement and relation of parts or elements; the
> condition or quality of being well-proportioned or well-
> balanced. [OED 17:456]

Harmony is defined as

> Combination or adaptation of parts, elements, or
> related things, so as to form a consistent and orderly
> whole; agreement, accord, congruity ... Combination of
> parts or details in accord with each other, so as to

> produce an æsthetically pleasing effect; agreeable aspect
> arising from apt arrangement of parts ... Pleasing
> combination or arrangement of sounds, as in poetry or
> in speaking; sweet or melodious sound. [OED 6:1125]

Elegance is defined as

> Tasteful correctness, harmonious simplicity, in the
> choice and arrangement of words. [OED 5:129]

Whereas rhythm and symmetry are mainly outward
connotations, related to the verbal expressions of poetry,
harmony and elegance are a kind of inner rhythm and symmetry
between ideas, sentences, and words.

Sweetness is defined as “the quality of being sweet,” and the
word sweet has many connotations, such as:

> Marked by or arising from graciousness, kindness or
> sympathy ... not intemperate or extreme ... pleasing to
> the mind or the feeling: arousing agreeable or delightful
> emotions ... pleasing to the ear: gently armonious: not
> ... disturbing ... much loved. [Webster 2309]

The idea of an identity between beauty and sweetness in
regard to poetry is at odds with the ideas of a number of
Western modern poets and literary critics. And yet it was
perfectly normal in the past. Dolce stil novo (sweet new style)
was the name of the poetical School which flourished in
Florence in the second half of the twelfth century, and which
marks the beginning of Italian literature. And Dante Alighieri,
who was among the poets of that School, wrote in one of his
most famous sonnets describing Beatrice as his inspiring muse:
“her sweetness through the eyes reaches the heart” (Vita Nuova
57), which perhaps may be better rendered as “and through your
eyes she gives such a sweetness to your heart.”

502                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Delicacy is defined as

> Exquisite fineness of texture, substance, finish, etc.;
> graceful slightness, slenderness, or softness; soft or
> tender beauty ... Exquisite fineness of feeling,
> observation, etc.; nicety of perception; sensitiveness of
> appreciation ... Exquisite fineness or nicety of skill,
> expression, touch, etc ... A refined sense of what is
> becoming, modest or proper; sensitiveness to the
> feelings of modesty, shame, etc.; delicate regard for the
> feelings of others. [Webster 596]

This connotation of beauty as sweetness and delicacy is
reminiscent of other qualities recommended by the Bahá’í
teachings, that is, “refinement,” “reverence,” “respect for that
which is sacred,” “purity” and “good taste.”

As to refinement, it is prescribed by Bahá’u’lláh in the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas [36, para.46]: “Hold ye fast unto refinement under
all conditions.” The Arabic word li†áfat, here translated as
“refinement,” “has a wide range of meanings with both spiritual
and physical implications, such as elegance, gracefulness,
cleanliness, civility, politeness, gentleness, delicacy and
graciousness, as well as being subtle, refined, sanctified and
pure” [“Notes” 199].

As to reverence, it is listed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá among the
“inward ... perfections” that should characterize “the spiritually
learned” [SDC 34]. He moreover recommended it when visiting
the holy places. He wrote in this regard in a Tablet addressed to
Ethel Rosenberg: “You have asked about visiting holy places
and the observance of marked reverence toward these
resplendent spots. Holy places are undoubtedly centers of the
outpouring of Divine grace, because on entering the illumined
sites associated with martyrs and holy souls, and by observing
reverence, both physical and spiritual, one’s heart is moved
with great tenderness” [qtd. in Synopsis 61, no.26].

As to respect for that which is sacred, it is mentioned in a
letter written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an
individual on 24 September 1987 [qtd. in CC3:40, no.82] as “one of
the distinctive virtues given emphasis in the Bahá’í Writings”
and as a consequence of the Bahá’í “view of the world” whereby
“we perceive creation to encompass spiritual as well as physical
entities, and we regard the purpose of the world in which we
now find ourselves to be a vehicle for our spiritual progress.”

As to purity, it is described by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in a famous
Tablet, in which He explained:

> To be pure and holy in all things is an attribute of the
> consecrated soul and a necessary characteristic of the
> unenslaved mind. The best of perfections is immaculacy
> and the freeing of oneself from every defect. Once the
> individual is, in every respect, cleansed and purified,
> then will he become a focal centre reflecting the
> Manifest Light. [SWAB 146, no.129]

As to good taste, it is mentioned in a letter written on behalf
of the Universal House of Justice to an individual on 23
February 1987 [qtd. in CC3:39, no.81]. The letter says: “the House
of Justice feels artists should not be inhibited by Bahá’í
institutions from creating a variety of calligraphic renderings
of the Holy Writings or of the Greatest Name. However, such
efforts should be in good taste and not assume forms that lend
themselves to ridicule.” These words may be easily extrapolated
into the context of poetry.

Beauty as sweetness and delicacy is also an important bridge
between the mainly physical and intellectual prerequisites of
rhythm, symmetry, harmony, and elegance and the declared
spiritual purpose of poetry of inspiring the heart with lofty
ideas and feelings, which will be mentioned later on.

504                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Perfection is defined as

> The condition, state, or quality of being perfect or free
> from all defect; supreme excellence; flawlessness,
> faultlessness. [OED 11:538]

And also:

> ... correspondence with or approximation to an ideal
> concept ... an unsurpassable degree of accuracy or
> excellence ... complete mastery of technique ... [Websters’
> 1677]

“Excellence in all things” is such an important goal for the
Bahá’ís that the Universal House of Justice issued on 23
November 1981 a specific compilation under the same title [see
CC1:367-84], exhorting the Bahá’ís to “follow Bahá’u’lláh’s
exhortation to distinguish themselves from others through
deeds” [MUHJ 510, no.303.1]. But in the arts ‘Abdu’l-Bahá suggests
nothing less than perfection. As He is reported to have said to
Mary L. Lucas: “It is natural for the heart and spirit to take
pleasure and enjoyment in all things that show forth symmetry,
harmony, and perfection ...” [12, bold added].

All these prerequisites of beauty — rhythm, symmetry,
harmony, elegance, sweetness, delicacy, and perfection — are
evident in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s poems. Unfortunately no translation
can convey the qualities of the rhythm, symmetry, harmony,
and elegance of the original, especially the rhythm, strictly
associated as it is to the sound of the original words.

As to symmetry, it is especially evident in the following
three-couplets poem, which is part of a short Tablet in prose,
on the issue of “the banquet of the eternal Covenant (bazm-i-
alast)” [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 13:142]. This short poem is introduced
by the following words: “The divine Minstrel took up his lute
and begun to intone Persian melodies, giving voice to his
harmonious song (Mu†rib-i-iláhí awtár-i-mathálith va mathání

bi-dast girift va bi-ahang-i-parsí naghmih va sáz numúd va bi-
shahnáz ín taránih ágház kard)” [ibid. 142]. The poem says:

1.1. ˆn ‘Ahd-i-Alast ast ín / Paymánih bi-dast ast ín

Bázar shikast ast ín / Az Yúsuf-i-ra˙mání.

This is the Day of the Eternal Covenant. The Cup is at

hand.
This is a market crash, because of the Divine Joseph.

1.2. Mítháq-i-vifáq ast ín / Paymán-i-†aláq ast ín

Áfát-i-nu‘áq ast ín / Az ra˙mat-i-Yazdání.

This is the Covenant of concord. This is the Covenant of

repudiation.
This is a calamity for the foreboders of evil, because of

the mercy of God.

1.3. ˆn ‘Ahd-i-qadím ast ín / ˆn Sirr-i-qavím ast ín

ˆn Ramz-i-‘aẓím ast ín / Az Ṭal‘at-i-Abhá’í.

This is the Ancient Covenant. This is the irrefutable Secret

[GPB 39].
This is the great Mystery, because of the Most Glorious

Countenance. [Provisional translation by the authors]

The symmetry of these three verses is evident in the Persian
text, in the repetition of the locution “ast ín,” which means
“this is.” In the English translation we see the symmetry of
three short consecutive sentences in each verse, very similar to
one another, preceding a final locution, introduced by the
preposition “because of.”

As to harmony, a translation cannot convey the harmony of
the original Persian words. But it can convey the harmony of
the images used by the Poet. An example are the following
successive hemistiches:

506                                                   Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Vajh-i-hudá tábán shudih.

The Divine guidance shines brightly.

Khuffásh-há pinhán shudih.
Bats hide themselves in their holes. (Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 55:132;

provisional translation by the authors)

In the first hemistich the lights of guidance shine brightly; in
the second one, the bats, creatures of the night, hide themselves
in their holes.

As to elegance, a notable poem is the above mentioned ˆn
‘Ahd-i-Alast ast ín [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 13:142]. The elegance of this
poem is especially due to its recurrent use of the word
Covenant and of a number of related images: “the cup
(paymánih)” [verse 1], the Day of Judgment, “A calamity for the
foreboders of evil (áfát-i-nu‘áq)” [verse 2], “the irrefutable
Secret (Sirr-i-qavím)” and “the great Mystery (Ramz-i-‘aẓím),”
and their appearance as the “Most Glorious Countenance
(Ṭal‘at-i-Abhá’í)” [verse 3]. In this poem the English word
Covenant corresponds to three Persian words, Mítháq, Paymán,
and Ahd. According to the ancient Sufis these three words have
slightly different connotations. The word Mítháq is the
preeternal covenant mentioned in the so called verse of the
Covenant in the Koran: “And when thy Lord brought forth
their descendants from the reins of the sons of Adam and took
them to witness against themselves, ‘Am I not,’ said He, ‘your
Lord?’ They said, ‘Yes, we witness it’” [7:172, Rodwell]. Khwajih
Shamsu’d-Dín Óáfiẓ (1315–1390) writes about this Covenant:

From the dawn of the morn of eternity without beginning to

the end of the evening of eternity without end,

In respect to one covenant and to one agreement (mítháq),

friendship with love was. [Divan 343, no. 178, v. 6]
As to the word Paymán, the Italian orientalist Alessandro
Bausani (1921–1988) writes: “A number of times ... the

concepts of Cup and Pact are linked (and this is something
more than a pun between paymân and paymâneh!): a sip from
the cup seals a Primeval Pact between man and God” [Religion in
Iran 262-3]. Óáfiẓ uses the two words Paymán and Paymánih in
the following verses:

Last night, to the wine-house (the Ārif, the comprehender of

truths), Óáfiẓ, sitting in khilwat, went:

From the head of his covenant (Paymán), he departed; and to the

head of the cup (paymánih), went. [Divan 460, no. 257, v. 1]
In this poem ‘Abdu’l-Bahá mentions “the Covenant of
repudiation (Paymán-i-†aláq).” This may allude to the
distinction between the good and the evil ones that will be
made on the Day of Judgment as described in the Koran: “Then
the people of the right hand — Oh! how happy shall be the
people of the right hand! And the people of the left hand — Oh!
how wretched shall be the people of the left hand!” [56:8-9,
Rodwell]. As to the meaning of the Day of Judgment, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá wrote: “This period of time is the Promised Age, the
assembling of the human race to the ‘Resurrection Day’ and
now is the great ‘Day of Judgment’” [TAB 2:318]. As to the word
Ahd, the Sufís considered it as a station of the sincere. Óafiẓ
writes about this Covenant:

Although grief for Thee gave to the wind the harvest of my

life,

(Falling) in the dust of Thy precious foot, (I displayed

> fidelity); for the covenant (ahd) (that I had made), I
> broke not. (Divan 645, no. 373, v. 2]
However, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá seemingly uses this word as a synonym
of Mítháq, since He writes “This is the ancient Covenant (ˆn
Ahd-i-qadím ast ín),” and the word qadím means in the Sufi
usage “without beginning or end” [Steingass 959].

508                                                   Lights of Irfán vol. 18

As to sweetness, a significant strophe composed by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá reads as follows:

Áfáq ‘anbar bár shud.

Mushk-i-Khu†á íthár shud.

Chún nukhat-i-gulzár shud.

Yik shimmih’í az búy-i-Tú.

The universe smells with amber.

Perfumes of musk exhale from Cathay.

Sweet aromas blow from the rose-gardens.
A breath of Thy fragrance. [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 55:341;

provisional translation by the authors]

The sweetness of this strophe stems from the delicate scents
that caress our inner senses.

As to delicacy, in His poem Anvár-i-Óaqq rukhshán shudih
[Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 55:132-5],  He describes Bahá’u’lláh with a very
delicate and refined expression:, “the rose-queen of the green
expanses (sul†án-i-gul dar sa˙n-i-chaman)” [verse 13]. Moreover,
the Master’s poems are hymns to Bahá’u’lláh. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
laments His “remoteness (hijrán)” from Him [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb
55:131, verses 15 and 17]; “is thirsty (lab-tishnih)” [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb
21:234, verse 7] for Him; and proclaims His love for Him.
However, He never mentions the fact that He is His son.
Rather He declares Himself “an humble servant (sag, literally,
dog)” on His “way (kúy)” [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 21:234, verse 9], “dust
(kháq)” on His “threshold (dargáh)” [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 55:342, verse
17]. The delicacy of these words is the result of the deep
humility of a wholly self-effaced Man, Who has been defined
by His Father the “Mystery of God” [qtd. in WOB 133], and yet
does not show towards His Father a human love, but the love
tinged with awe, reverence and respect due to the
Manifestation of God.

As to perfection, an example are the following verses by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

Án jilviy-i-Rabbu’l-junúd

> Rukh dar kuh-i-Íahyún numúd
> Karmil nidá-há mí-numúd.

This revealed Lord of Hosts

> Turned His face toward Sion
> And the Carmel resounded

Bá chang-u tár-u náy-u ‘úd

Núr az rukh-i-a˙báb bín.

With harps and flutes, rebecs and lutes.
Which light from the lovers’ faces! (Jabbari 290, verses 7, 8;

provisional translation by the authors)

It is the sound of “harps and flutes, rebecs and lutes” rising
from Mount Carmel that touches our hearts, as we remember a
special time we may have had on that blessed Mount, when our
faces too may have glowed with inner light.

Eloquence is defined as

> The action, practice, or art of expressing thought with
> fluency, force, and appropriateness, so as to appeal to
> the reason or move the feelings. [OED 5:148]

The prerequisite of eloquence requires for poets to be able
to say fluently, forcibly, and properly the things they want to
say, while at the same time being able to respect the above
mentioned prerequisites of beauty.

As to eloquence the following words reported as uttered by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá have been recorded by Isabel Fraser Chamberlain:

510                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

> I hope that you will all become eloquent. The greatest
> gifts of man are reason and eloquence of expression.
> The perfect man is both intelligent and eloquent. He has
> knowledge and knows how to express it. Unless man
> express himself in this day he will remain like a closed
> casket and one cannot know whether it contains jewels
> or glass. I desire that all of you may speak on the
> material and divine sciences with clear and convincing
> words. [ADP 98]

These words are reminiscent of an explanation of the
importance of words given by Bahá’u’lláh Himself, which any
poet should assimilate so as to make them a part of his own
being. He wrote in His Law˙-i-Maqßúd that

> Human utterance is an essence which aspireth to exert
> its influence and needeth moderation. As to its
> influence, this is conditional upon refinement which in
> turn is dependent upon hearts which are detached and
> pure. As to its moderation, this hath to be combined
> with tact and wisdom as prescribed in the Holy
> Scriptures and Tablets ... It behoveth a prudent man of
> wisdom to speak with utmost leniency and forbearance
> so that the sweetness of his words may induce everyone
> to attain that which befitteth man’s station. [TB 172-3]

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s eloquence stems from His capacity of
exalting this most exalted Day of God through words which are
at the same time lofty and plain, refined and simple. A
fascinating example is the first part of the poem Anvár-i-Óaqq
rukhshán shudih [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 55:132-3], which describes the
Day of God, in uncomplicated but enticing words:

1.    Anvár-i-Óaqq rukhshán shudih.

> Daryáy-i-Óaqq júshán shudih.

Vajh-i-hudá tábán shudih.

> The lights of God glisten.
> The sea of God surges.

His guidance shines brightly.

2. Khuffásh-há pinhán shudih.

> Abr-i-Karam giryán shudih.

Barq-i-Qidam Khándán shudih.

> Bats hide themselves in their holes.
Clouds rain down their mercy. (SWAB 192, sec. 160; Muntakh

187)
The Eternal’s lightening flashes.

3. Gulshan fa∂áy-i-ján shudih.

> Pur az gul-u ray˙án shudih.

Bulbul bi-ṣad al˙án shudih.

> A paradise for spirits, gardens
> Are covered with flowers and shrubs.

Dazzled by the face of the rose.

4. Bar rúy-i-gul ˙ayrán shudih.

> Madhúsh-u sar-gardán shudih,
> Mast-i-rukh-i-jánán shudih.

> The nightingale sings a hundred songs.
> Astonished and confounded,
> It gets drunk with the cheek of the Beloved.

5. Makhmúr-u ham sakrán shudih,

> Pur áh-u pur afghán shudih.

Súy-i-Khudá nálán shudih.
512                                                Lights of Irfán vol. 18

> Seized by its giddiness,
> It raises groans and moans,
Lifting this plea unto God. [Provisional translation by the

authors]

These verses eloquently describe the Day of God as a
springtime, with its clouds, its rains, its lightenings, its flowers
and a nightingale which, drunken with the beauty of the rose,
raises its prayer unto God. The verses are short, the words are
few, there are few learned references, but the description is
graphic and lively.

A versified language

‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote in His Tablet to Mr. and Mrs. Deuth
that “eloquent and significant words are compared to pearls.
But these pearls are of two kinds, one is the versified language
and that is called poetry and the other is the ordinary language
called prose” [“Tablets to Baháis” 259]. Of course, since as Shoghi
Effendi explained in a letter written on his behalf to an
individual on 3 February 1952, “the Prophets of God do not
teach the arts; but the tremendous cultural impetus which
religion gives to society gradually produces new and wonderful
forms of art” [qtd. in CC3:31, no.63], the Bahá’ís cannot think that
by verses only the ancient form of verses, based on rhyme or on
other rhetorical devices, should be intended. As a matter of
fact, the Modern age introduced the so called “free verse” into
practically all languages, including Fársí. Free verse, a “loan
translation of French Vers Libre,” may be defined as
“unmetered and often irregularly lined out unrhymed verse that
depends upon extensive variation in rhythm, balanced phrasing,
syntactical repetition, and typographical and grammatical
oddness to achieve its effects” [Myers and Simms 123]. And thus
Bahá’í poets may feel certainly free to use it. In this vein the
Bahá’í Canadian poet and writer Jack A. McLean writes:

> I’ve always wanted to write
> a poem in plain speaking,
> without artifice,
> before a critic tells me
> I belong more to the nineteenth
> than to the twentieth century. [54]

‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote His poems more or less in the years when
the modern Iranian literature was born, that is, the years of the
constitutionalist movement preceding the bourgeois revolution
of 1905–1911. Those poets produced a “neoclassic poetry” that
“without breaking the old forms,” became “filled with
moralistic and social contents” [Bausani, “Letteratura neopersiana”
540]. He sometimes follows the ancient rules of Persian metrics,
which had remained unchanged for several centuries. In this
vein He authored a traditional mathnaví, defined by Edward G.
Browne (1862–1926), the renowned British Orientalist, as a
“poem in ‘doublets,’ which is generally narrative, and where the
rhyme changes in each couplet” [1:473], Ay Khudáy-i-Pur-‘A†áy-
i-Dhu’l-Manán [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 13:208]. He also wrote three
unconventional ghazals, the typical Persian, refined “elegy of
love” [Blachère, “Ghazal”], ˆn ˙alq-i-Bahá dar ˙alqih fitád (Majmú‘iy-
i-Makátíb 21:234], the only poem that He signs in the last line,
Sham‘-i-shabistán-i-˙aqq [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 13:203-4] and Núr-i-
hudá tábán shudih [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 13:205-6]. He did not write
any qaṣídih, defined by Brown “purpose-poem” [2:22]. Many of
His poetical works are characterized by short verses, a number
of them are not monorhymed, as the classical Persian metrics
prescribe. And when He uses the classical radíf, that is “a word
or a whole phrase that follows the rhyme letter (rawiyy) and
recurs in every line of the poem” [Heinrichs, “Radīf”], He
sometimes uses it in a very loose way. For example, in His
above mentioned 17 verses poem Anvár-i-Óaqq rukhshán
shudih [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 55:132], He uses the rhyme in –án and
the radíf shudih only in the first five verses. Then He changes
both the rhyme and the radíf. His poetical style is so original

514                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

that sometimes it is difficult to write down His poems in a
specific classical graphic form.

Novelty

‘Abdu’l-Bahá adds a further quality of poetry: “new
significances” [TAB 1:58]. In this regard, a Bahá’í poet should
consider a number of important points. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said
about the twentieth century that “this is a century of life and
renewal” [PUP 140]. However, not every renewal introduced
during that century either conforms with the Bahá’í teachings
or may be considered as contributing to the advancement of
human civilization. The Universal House of Justice wrote, in its
message addressed to the Iranian Bahá’ís throughout the world
on 10 February 1980:

> Even music, art, and literature, which are to represent
> and inspire the noblest sentiments and highest
> aspirations and should be a source of comfort and
> tranquillity for troubled souls, have strayed from the
> straight path and are now the mirrors of the soiled
> hearts of this confused, unprincipled, and disordered
> age. [MUHJ 435, no.246.4]

In these circumstances Bahá’í poets should remember ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s invitation to “leave imitation and seek reality” [PUP 169]
and His statement on 17 November 1912 that

> reformation and renewal of the fundamental reality of
> religion constitute the true and outworking spirit of
> modernism, the unmistakable light of the world, the
> manifest effulgence of the Word of God, the divine
> remedy for all human ailment and the bounty of eternal
> life to all mankind. [PUP 439]

Thus they will more likely feel free from the worst “new”
aspects of some contemporary poetical Western trends, and

closer to the true modernism, that is the “renewal of the
fundamental reality of religion” [ibid.].

The idea of novelty and renewal is often explained in the
Bahá’í writings through the metaphor of springtime, a
metaphor which also perfectly suits poetry. On 19 May 1912
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said in this vein: “though the calendar changes and
the years move forward, each springtime that comes is the
return of the springtime that has gone; this spring is the renewal
of the former spring. Springtime is springtime, no matter when
or how often it comes” [PUP 126-7]. This is not a stale repetition
of the ancient pessimistic formula: “Nullum est iam dictum
quod non sit dictum prius (There is nothing said which has not
been said before)” [Terence, Eunuchus 41]. Each spring has its novel
and its repetitious aspects. The novelty comes from the eternal
change characterizing the physical world: ‘All things move and
nothing remains still’ [Heraclitus, qtd. in Plato, ‘Cratylus’ 401, section d,
line 5]. The repetition comes, in the vegetable world, from the
roots of the trees. We may then assume that if a poet wants to
be innovative, he needs to be free from imitations either of
past or present poets, and understand the above mentioned real
great novelty of this age, the renewal of the reality of religion.
He will thus be able to be innovative, while at the same time
preserving the roots of his civilization, like a tree in the newly
arrived springtime. He will contribute to “guarantee the
transmittal to the future of those skills which will preserve the
marvellous, indispensable achievements of the past” as the
Universal House of Justice recommended the Bahá’í youth of
the world in a message addressed to them on 8 May 1985 [MUHJ
637, no.428.8].

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “Bahá’u’lláh’s ... most exalted handiwork, the
stainless Mirror of His light, the perfect Exemplar of His
teachings, the unerring Interpreter of His Word, the
embodiment of every Bahá’í ideal, the incarnation of every
Bahá’í virtue” [WOB 133], has given an incomparable example of
what is suggested by these words. His poems have deep roots in
the glorious lyrical past of Iran, but they also present, as has

516                                            Lights of Irfán vol. 18

been said, many innovative elements in prosody, contents and
especially in spirit. Besides, in conformity with His idea that the
true modernism is the “renewal of the fundamental reality of
religion” [PUP 439], most of His poems are a joyous
announcement of the new spiritual springtime which dawned
over the whole world in 1844.

Expressivity

‘Abdu’l-Bahá praised poems which “expressed significant
meanings in eulogy of ... [the] Lord, the Merciful, the Clement”
[TAB 1:58]. Expressivity has been defined in a celebrated
dictionary of the Italian language as the capacity

> to communicate ... through words orally or in a written
> form ... a thought, an idea, a feeling, a mood, an
> emotion, a sensation ... to represent ... in an artistic
> form, through a given matter or language and in a
> definite and particular form (feelings, emotions, ideas,
> conceptions, etc., or one’s spirituality, one’s way of
> perceiving and conceiving reality). [Battaglia 5:403]

This is a very important aspect of poetry. Whereas a piece of
prose may describe an object in a rational way, poetry is
supposed to directly convey its meaning. For instance, prose
may accurately describe the qualities of a flower, but poetry
should be able to create the idea of its beauty and flavour in its
readers. And usually poetry fulfils this task through a
metaphoric language. In this respect poetry resembles
Scripture, which usually explain spiritual truth through images.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá often associated the idea of expressivity with the
expression of “the beauty of ... characters and the merit of ...
virtues” [TAB 2:400] and “of all the bounties of life to mankind”
[PUP 16]. These words may well be also referred to poetry.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s poems perfectly express the joy raised in the
hearts of the sincere seekers by the advent of the new Day of

God. One of the most expressive among ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s poems
is Núr-i-hudá tábán shudih [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 13:205-6]:

8.1. Núr-i-hudá tábán shudih. Ṭúr-i-tuqá rakhshán shudih.

Músá bi-ján púyán shudih. Kuhsár Síná ámadih.

The light of guidance shineth. The mountain of virtue

gloweth.
Moses hasteneth with heart and soul. Each mount

becometh a Sinai.

2. Ṣub˙-i-jabín, núr-i-mubín ván ‘ári∂-i-gulgún bín.

Bá la‘l-i-rangíní chun-ín án gharrih gharrá’ ámadih.

Look at the gleaming forehead, at the manifest light, at

the rosy cheek.
With vermillion lips, that snow-white moon hath come.

3. Hardam nasímí mí-vazad búy-i-‘abíri mí-risad.

Ṣub˙-i-umídí mí-damad, ghabrá’ núrá ámadih.

An uninterrupted breeze bloweth, an amber scent wafteth.

The morn of hope ariseth and the world is enlightened.

4. Daryáy-i-Óaqq pur-mawj shud. Har mawj az án yik fawj
shud.

Ván fawj-há bar awj shud: har past bálá ámadih.

The Ocean of Truth swelleth. Its waves grow into billows.

The billows surge. Whatever’s below riseth above.

5. Ṣawt-i-ana’l-Óaqq har zamán áyad zi-awj-i-ásmán.

Mí-na-shnavad juz gúsh-i-ján ádhán ṣammá ámadih.

The call “I am God” resoundeth from on high.

Only the inner ear heareth, the outer one is deaf.
518                                                Lights of Irfán vol. 18

6. Abr-i-gawhar-bár ast ín, fay∂-i-durar-bár ast ín.

Núr-i-sharar-bár ast ín, anvár bahrá’ ámadih.

It is a cloud raining pearls. It is a grace spreading jewels.

It is a light emanating sparks, a dazzling splendor.

7. Áfáq ‘anbar bár shud. Imkán pur az anvár shud.

Bas khuftih-há bídár shud. Ta‘bír-i-ruyá’ ámadih.

Covered with amber, the world. Illumined by lights, the

universe.
Sleepers wake up. The vision is fulfilled.

8. ‘Ishq-i-Khudá khúnríz shud. ‘Álam sharar angíz shud.

Jám-i-‘a†á labríz shud, chún dawr-i-ßahbá ámadih.

It is the season of wine: the love of God sheddeth blood,
The world sprayeth sparks, the cup of favor

overfloweth. (Provisional translation by the authors)

The metrics of this eight couplet poem is classical, almost a
ghazal. Its rhyme is -á, its radíf is ámadih, which means “has
come.” Its expressivity is the result of a number of classical
topoi: Moses and the Sinai, and His glowing forehead; the
beautiful face of the Beloved; the blowing breeze which wafts a
scent of amber; the billowing Ocean of Truth; the call “I am
God,” which only the inner ear perceives; the bountiful cloud;
the glowing light; the waking up sleepers; the season of wine;
the cruelty of love.

Depth and loftiness of meanings

‘Abdu’l-Bahá says very clearly what He means as depth and
loftiness of meanings. When He praises a poem for its meaning,
it is because that poem is “like the melody of the birds of
holiness in the paradise of El-Abha” [TAB 1:57], “a spiritual
anthem and a melody of the love of God” [TAB 1:59], because it

utters “the praise of ... [the] Lord and ... [expresses] significant
meanings in eulogy of ... [the] Lord, the Merciful, the Clement”
[TAB 1:58], and because its “theme, [is] the Manifest Light” [TAB
3:546].

Beside exalting the Day of God, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá uses His verses
to call on the lovers to rise above their human limitations; to be
willing to sacrifice their lives; to announce the glad-tiding; to
serve their fellow-men. In His poem Ay murdiy-i-bi-ján-u-dil
[Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 13:206] He repeats three urgent calls to His
readers: “rise, rise (jándár shú, jándár shú)” [verse 1], “wake up,
wake up (bídar shú, bídar shú)” [verse 2], and “bestir thyself,
bestir thyself (húshyár shú, húshyár shú)” [verse 3]. In His poem
Dast-i-karam bi-gushá [Majmú‘iy-i-Munáját 18-9] He repeats six
times, “Wake up, wake up (bídár shú, bídár shú), almost a
modern radíf. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s call is especially evident in the
following poem [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 13:203-4], written “one year
after the Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh” [SWAB 270, sec. 218]:

1. Sham‘-i-shabistán-i-˙aqq, núr bi-áfáq bakhsh.

Muqtabis az shams shú, shu‘lih-u ishráq bakhsh.

O torch in the divine chapel, illumine the world.
Take light from the sun and spread out luster and

flames.

2. Sharq munavvar numá gharb mu‘a††ar numá,

Rú˙ bi-ßiqláb dih núr bi-afláq bakhsh.

In the Orient scatter perfumes, and shed splendours on

Carry light unto the Bulgar, and the Slav with life

invest. [SWAB 270, sec. 218]

Marham-i-har zakhm shú. Dárúy-i-diryáq bakhsh.

Be a balm for each wound. Offer the infallible remedy.

4. Fitniy-i-‘álam ma-jú. Dar rah-i-ádam ma-pú.

Khálí az ín guftgú. Núr bi-akhláq bakhsh.

Don’t follow the mischiefs of the world. Don’t tread the

ways of the humans.
Get rid of any dispute. Have a luminous temper.

5. Gáh chú barq-i-si˙áb, gáh chú abr-i-bahár,

Khándih bi-lab-há bi-dih, giryih bi-áfáq bakhsh.

Khák-i-dar-ash bar tú táj. Muzhdih bi mushtáq bakhsh.

The grace of Bahá is a beacon. The aid of Bahá is a globe.
Let your crown be the dust on His threshold. To the

yearning hearts announce the god-spell.

8. Ján bi-chunín Dil-barí áfat-i-ins-u parí,

Gar bi-dahí. Bar parí. Furßat-i-‘ushsháq bakhsh.

To this handsome Sweetheart, a calamity for angels and

men,
Offer your soul. Take your flight. To each lover

proffer a chance.

9. Bul-bul-i-gúyá byá! Naghmih bi-gulshan sará!

Ṣí˙ih bi-zan yá Bahá! Rajfih bi-a†báq bakhsh!

O ye chirping nightingale! Come! Sing to the rose-bush!
Raise the cry, “O Bahá!” Shake the depths of the world!

The purposes of poetry

As to the purposes of poetry, Bahá’u’lláh Himself wrote a
‘Tablet to a Poet’ from which we may infer some of them:

> Blessed the poet who hath been filled with the spirit of
> the Day of God and from whose words hath wafted the
> sweet-smelling savour of the love of his Lord, the All-
> Merciful, over all created things. Such a one is, in truth,
> among the blissful. Woe betide the poet who hath drawn
> spears of sarcasm toward people and turned away from
> this wondrous Remembrance. Keep in mind the grace of
> God for having made your tongues the keys to His
> treasures and the revealers of His wisdom and
> mysteries. Walk ye in the fear of God and be not of the
> heedless. This is the day to celebrate His praise, the day
> in which the Creator of the heavens hath appeared with
> the kingdom of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Praised.
[qtd. in Rafati, Yādnāmih 296, personal translation by Omid

Ghaemmaghami]

Four main objectives are specified in this short Tablet: being
“filled with the spirit of the Day of God”; wafting “the sweet-
smelling savour of the love of ... (one’s) Lord, the All-Merciful,
over all created things”; unlocking “treasures” and revealing
“wisdom and mysteries”; and celebrating “His praise.” No
“spears of sarcasm” seem in this day acceptable from poets.

Similar objectives of poetry can also be inferred from words
written or uttered by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. As has been said, ‘Abdu’l-

522                                               Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Bahá encouraged a number of poets to write poems so that they
may be “like the melody of the birds of holiness in the paradise
of El-Abha” [TAB 1:57], “the cause of the gladness of their
hearers” [Tablet to Mr. Edgar Waite, “Recent Tablets” 318], and of the
delight of “the ears of the children of the Kingdom” [Tablet to
Mrs. Sháhnaz Waite, “Tablets to Baháis” 276], or so that their beauty
may “affect the minds and impress the hearts of those who
listen,” and their listeners may “find rest and joy and become in
tune with the love of God” [TAB 1:59], and “through reading it
the breast of the believers may be refreshed and dilated with
joy” [TAB 3:669]. Commotion, a feeling of rest and sweetness,
the “tune with the love of God” and the joy aroused by its
beauty are thus some of the feelings which poetry should raise
in the hearts of its readers. And, it is well known, “Joy gives us
wings! In times of joy our strength is more vital, our intellect
keener, and our understanding less clouded. We seem better
able to cope with the world and to find our sphere of
usefulness” [PT 110, sec. 35, para. 2]. This is one of the reasons why,
as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá reportedly said, “poetry is much more effective
and complete than prose. It stirs more deeply, for it is of a
finer composition!” [qtd. in Lucas 12], and, as Shoghi Effendi
pointed out in a letter written on his behalf to an individual on
10 October 1932, “art [comprising poetry] can better awaken
... nobler sentiments than cold rationalizing, especially among
the mass of the people” [qtd. in CC3:28, no.52]. If these vital
prerequisites are met, then a poem will accomplish its purpose,
that is a specific aspect of the general purpose of words
described by Bahá’u’lláh in His Law˙-i-Óikmat, exerting an
“influence” [TB 143]. In this specific case the purpose is to
inspire love for God and, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote in His Tablet
to Mr. James Simpson, “to render a distinguished service to the
divine Kingdom and to be the cause of the promulgation of the
oneness of mankind” [“Tablets received” 166]. And thus ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá seems to confirm the following words by the Latin poet
Quintus Horatius Flaccus (65 BC–8 BC), known in the English-
speaking world as Horace: “Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit
utile dulci, / lectorem delectando pariterque monendo” (Ars

Poetica 343-344), the one who mixes the useful with the
pleasing carries every vote, both teaching and delighting his
readers.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá does not exclude however that poetry may aim
at material goals and be equally excellent. But to this kind of
poetry He ascribes a lesser importance. He wrote in this regard
to Louise R. Waite:

> How many poets have come to this world who have
> written elegies and eulogies in the utmost of eloquence
> and excellence, but because the meanings were the
> realities of the world of nature, the effect was produced
> in the material world and the material world is limited,
> hence the effects of those meanings are limited. But
> thou art a composer of poetry which touches Divine
> Realities and Significances, therefore they are of the
> mysteries of the Kingdom and the meanings of the
> Kingdom are unlimited. The poetry of the renowned is
> perused in the material meetings, but thy poetry will
> forever be read in the Spiritual Meetings. [qtd. in Hatch
> 662]

As to the purpose of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá poems, the authors feel
that they are quite different in this regard from those of
Bahá’u’lláh. We could suppose that Bahá’u’lláh also wrote His
poems because He intended to leave to posterity a small
window opened on the depth of His human emotions. His
intimist verses, that is, His verses that deal “chiefly with
intimate and private especially psychological experiences”
[Webster 1184], are many indeed. Some of His verses reinforce in
us the impression that He really wanted to show glimmers of
His hidden human thoughts. This feature makes those
compositions especially precious for all people who are eager to
become more familiar with the Figure of Bahá’u’lláh and with
the human aspects of a Personage Who is known especially
through Works that He wrote with the majesty and the
authority of the “divine teacher” [SAQ 12, sec.3, para.15].4 This

524                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

aspect seems totally absent in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s poem. The poet is
mostly absent in these verses, except for proclaiming His love
for the Beloved, His submission to Him, His utter dependence
on Him. It seems that His main purposes are glorifying
Bahá’u’lláh, announcing His Revelation, calling people to
surrender to and to abide by His will. In this vein He describes
Himself as a “nightingale (bul-bul)” [Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 55:132, verse
3], “astonished and confounded (madhúsh-u sar-gardán)” [ibid.
verse 4], drunken “with the cheek of the Beloved (rukh-i-Jánán)”
[ibid.], uttering “groans and moans (Pur áh-u pur afghán
shudih)” [ibid. 5], and raising a plea unto God. But this prayer is
offered in the name of all human beings, that He may assist
them to find their life in Him [see ibid. verse 12]. Intimist verses
may be found in Ay Khudáy-i-Pur-‘A†áy-i-Dhu’l-Manán
[Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 13:208] and Ay Gul-rukh-i-Abháy-i-man!
[Majmú‘iy-i-Makátíb 55:340-2]. But in these poems as well, the
narrating subject that comes on the forefront in the first verses
becomes merged into the selves of all human beings, as early as
after verse 2 and verse 3, respectively.

Conclusion

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s writings and utterance, as well as His few
poems, can be an important source of inspiration for anyone
who wants either to write poems or to obtain a deeper
understanding of the poetic language. Hopefully in a not
distant future talented pens will come out, who will offer
skillful translations of these writings, utterances, and especially
poems by the blessed Pen of the Master.
