  Tablet to Jiná b-i- Mullá ‘Alí- Akbar f í

ar∂ i’l-álif 1

trans. Julio Savi and Faezeh Mardani

He i s th e E v er -A b i di n g, th e Al l - Kn o w i n g, th e
O mn i sc i e n t.
1\. O Pen of the Most High! Make mention of him who is

> immersed in the seas of doubt and passion, that perchance
> thou mayest purify him through that which floweth from
> thee and purge him from the defilement of the superstitious.
2\. Say: O servant who tarrieth in the land of bewilderment, and

> droneth round the Fire, say: “In the name of God, the Most
> Mighty, the Most Holy, the Most Glorious.” Then enter
> therein, and let the fear of no one dismay thee, put thy trust
> in God, the Lord of might and power. Verily, He causes it to
> become a light for thee, and a mercy upon thee, and a safety
> to the worlds. Beware, beware lest thou fearest the God Who
> created thee by virtue of His behest, or hast a doubt about
> the Revealer of the Bayán and what is therein whereby they
> may recognize Him Who is the Compassionate, the All-
> Merciful, and God hath quickened all things that they may
> attain His presence. This is what We have revealed in all the
> Tablets, if thou art of them that apprehend. All things are in
> the grasp of His power, all faces submit to His sovereignty
> and all were created through the potency of His weighty and
> unerring Command.
3\. Hast thou any doubt concerning Him before Whose

> countenance every luminary bows down (see Koran 12:4),
> before Whose majesty every man of glory is submissive,
> before Whose sovereignty every man of light humbles
> himself, before Whose knowledge every man of learning is
> ignorant, before Whose door every man of wealth is poor,
> before the manifestations of Whose might every man of
> power is abject, before the signs of Whose potency every
> mighty one is powerless, before Whose holiness every essence
352                               Tablet to Jináb-i-Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar

> is subjected to limitations, before the evidences of the lights
> of Whose eternity every man of the eternal realm is
> extinguished, and before the brilliance of Whose sanctified
> and luminous Face every man of splendor is eclipsed?
4\. Dost thou hesitate in your acceptance of Him on Whom all

> books have descended, to Whom all Scriptures have been
> revealed, and through Whom all the most glorious and
> exalted Names have been created? Dost thou ask the shadow
> about the sun and its light? Open thine eyes, then behold so
> that thou mayest find it in its zenith, in its sovereignty,
> might and grandeur with the lights that have enveloped with
> their brightness the Concourse on high and the denizens of
> the oceans of names and all that was and is, couldst thou but
> perceive it. And should the ophthalmia of vain imaginings
> prevent thine eyes from beholding the lights of the Beauty of
> thy Lord, the Exalted, the Most High, heal thou them, in My
> Name, the Healing, the Sufficing, the Manifest, the
> Wondrous. Dost thou ask the drop that hath remained in the
> depths of the darkest abyss about the ocean and its waves and
> sovereignty? I swear by God, this is an injustice from thyself
> towards thyself and towards thy Lord, the Mighty, the All-
> Knowing. Doth it beseem a man that hath eyes to perceive to
> ask about the sun in the sky after it has shone forth? No, by
> the Lord of the worlds.
5\. Beware, beware, the Decree of thy Lord is not dependent

> upon the sanction of anything but Him or the acceptance of
> any creature. Verily, all else besides Him have been created
> through His command and have been fashioned through His
> will. And He hath created them as He hath created thee, and
> there is no difference in this day between thee and all else
> except thyself, except him whom God hath assisted through
> His Cause and acquainted with the manifestation of His Self.
> And verily he is the best among all creatures in the holy and
> preserved Tablets. Say: Verily He hath been known from
> eternity through Himself, and not by the testimony of
> anyone among His servants and their acceptance. He
> remaineth for eternity as He was, and no one denieth this
> truth but all contumacious deniers.
6\. Therefore, O servant, be fair in thyself. Is God powerful over

> His Cause or canst thou fix His manifestation in a time of
> times? If thou recognizeth that He is powerful to exalt His
> transcendent sovereignty, verily He manifesteth Himself as
> He wisheth and no one questions what He desireth. And if
> thou dost imagine that thou art powerful, adduce then thy
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                   353

> proof and be not of the negligent. Beware lest thou deemest
> the Cause of God subject either to the limitations of thy self
> or to those of any of His people. Know thou, then, that all
> else besides Him is powerless to know His Being and the
> nature of His Manifestation, except they who know Him
> through a bounty on His part and a mercy from Him. Verily,
> He is the Most Merciful of the Merciful. The whirlwinds of
> wrath and the tempests of rage were ready to blow from thy
> doubts upon all beings. Fear thou God, then beg thou
> forgiveness seventy times, so that He may forgive thee by
> His grace. And verily He is the Great Giver, the Bountiful.

7\. Purify thine heart from all allusions that are in thee and from

> the words of the people of the Qur’án. Then, arise towards
> the atmosphere wherein the lights of the Face of thy Lord, the
> Merciful, shine forth, that thou mayest perceive thyself
> independent from whatever thou hast heard and mayest find
> thyself freed from the worlds. O servant! I swear by God!
> Verily, in this most great, most mighty Revelation, the
> testimony of God hath been fulfilled ere the revelation of a
> single letter of His Verses which the most learned of the
> learned are powerless to comprehend. After this Revelation,
> look thou with thine inward eyes upon the proof through
> which thy faith hath been previously confirmed. Beware lest
> thou question anyone about this. Content thyself with what
> is revealed on the part of thy Lord. Verily, He suffices thee
> above anything else but Him. Say: Praised be God, the King
> of the Mighty Throne. Often in the time of the Revelation t
> those to whom the people turn for answers (mas’ul, lit.
> questioned persons) are wrapt in the dense veils of the self
> and are among the heedless. And whosoever questions such
> people as these is like unto one born blind who questions
> another born blind. Does this profit him in any way? No, by
> the Self of the Lord, the Most Exalted, the All-Wise.

8\. Beware lest thou art among them that have clung to the hem

> of their leaders in the time when God came upon the clouds
> of the Cause in His Name, the Most August, the Most
> Mighty, and have turned their back upon God in opposition,
> and therefore the verdict of divine chastisement was
> pronounced against them and they returned to their abode,
> and wretched is the abode of them that have repudiated the
> Truth. Cast the veil of vain imaginings under thy feet. Then
> ascend towards the resplendent court of Sanctity and
> Majesty, that thou mayest see all things under the shadow of
> the Word that was revealed by His Pen, or even better under
354                               Tablet to Jináb-i-Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar

the shadow of His Self, the Exalted, the Incomparable.
9\. O servant! Verily, We have perceived from thee the odor of

> the ancient allusions of them to whom the Qur’án was given,
> allusions about references to the vicegerency and others,
> wherefore I was saddened and the Manifestations of the
> Names in their Realms and the Revealers of His attributes in
> their dominions were grieved. For We have enjoined Our
> servants in the Bayán to sanctify themselves from all that
> pertaineth unto them, because all that pertaineth unto them
> does not make them wholly independent in the Day of
> Judgment and shuts them out from the presence of God and
> deprives them of His holy fragrance, as thou thyself didst
> behold and didst bear witness.
10\. Hast thou not heard that He liveth in the All-Glorious

> Horizon and hath no need of a vicegerent after His
> Revelation? Say: Far be from the glory of God what I have
> imagined in my heart and the wrongs I have committed, and I
> was among the oppressors. And there is no temporal thing
> with Him that His vicegerent may divide among his heirs. As
> to His Cause, it is with Him and is not separated from Him.
> Beware lest thou dost assign to Him any representative, or
> vicegerent, or reckoner, or counselor, or peer, and be among
> them that have truly repented. Verily, He is sufficient
> through Himself to all creation and nothing is independent
> of Him in the heavens and on earth, if thou art among the
> mindful.
11\. Yea, God hath mirrors for Himself wherein He may shine to

> themselves for themselves, if they are placed before the sun
> and its rays. This is what thou beholdest in the outer mirrors,
> if thou art among the observers. And they speak of the
> splendor of the sun, if they are placed before it and if they
> remain where they were beforehand. When they depart, the
> light returns unto its source and place, and with the mirrors
> the veils remain. Thus have We explained unto thee that of
> which thou wert unaware, that thou mayest be among the
> true believers. And this station is not specially set aside for
> anyone at the exception of any other one. By God, the True
> One, in this Day should all creatures turn themselves towards
> the lights of the sun that shine above the All-Glorious
> Horizon with the ornament of God, the Omnipotent, the
> Exalted, the Mighty, the splendor of the lights of the sun
> would be reflected in them and none would deny it, except
> those who are ignorant and far removed and others similar to
> them.

12\. Hast thou not heard, O servant, that the Manifestation that

> became manifest in the year Sixty was the Manifestation of
> God and brought to a close the Prophethood of Muhammad,
> the Messenger of God? Verily, God, thy Lord, is sanctified
> from all mention, and allusion, and proof, and relation, and
> association. Verily, He has been established throughout
> eternity upon the Throne of Holiness and sanctified from all
> created things and it would be unseemly for anyone to assign
> to Him a vicegerent. Verily, the vicegerent is for those
> prophets who were created through His word. Say: Blessed be
> God, the most excellent of creators! Blessed be God, the most
> excellent of makers! Verily, We have abrogated such names in
> the Bayán and We have dashed to the ground the idols of
> fancy, that none should remain shut out as by a veil by them
> from God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy fathers. Beware lest
> thou lookest at Me through the eyes of anyone but Me and if
> thou wishest to know Me, look at Me through My eyes and
> thou wilt not know Me through anything but those,2
> although thou ponderest so that thou mayest know Me till
> the end that none among the reckoners can reckon.3
13\. Whenever thou wishest to attain to the pinnacle of grace

> and draw nigh unto the most exalted court and desirest that
> all the good in the heaven of the divine decree may be
> ordained for thee, on the part of thy Lord, the Most Exalted,
> the Most Glorious, detach thyself from all things, perform
> ablutions with clear4 and pure water, as hast been ordained
> for thee in the Book (Bayán)5 on the part of Him Who is the
> Sovereign Revealer, the Ancient of Days and, while thou art
> washing thy hands, say:6
14\. O Lord! Cleanse me from all save Thee, and prepare me to

> meet thee (liqá) in the day of the manifestation of Thy Beauty
> and the rise (qiyámi) of Thy Self. Sanctify me from
> whatsoever may shut me out as by a veil from Thy
> resplendent Beauty. Purify me, moreover, O my God, that I
> may recognise Thy Self, the Most Exalted, the Omniscient.7

15\. And while washing thy face, say:8
16\. O Lord! This is my face that I wash with this water, as Thou

> didst ordain. I beseech Thee, therefore, O my God, by Thy
> Name from which Thy servants,9 except the faithful
> (muwaÓidún) among Thy creatures, are shut out as by a veil,
> to cleanse my face with the waters of Thy mercy, flowing out
> from the right hand of the throne of Thy Majesty, that it may
> be purified through Thine hallowed, resplendent and
356                               Tablet to Jináb-i-Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar

> luminous Face. O Lord! Protect it, through Thy Name, the
> Most Holy, the Most Exalted, the Most Wondrous, the Most
> Glorious, that it may have no regard for aught else besides
> Thee, and may not turn towards them who have disbelieved
> in the greatest of Thy signs in the day of the manifestation of
> Thy Self, the Exalted, the Most High. O my God! Withhold
> not from me the glances of the eye of Thy loving-kindness,
> and shatter not my hopes in the holy breezes of Thy favour.
> Verily, Thou art He Who is ready to answer whosoever
> calleth upon Thee and is nigh unto them that seek Thy
> presence.10 Verily, Thou art the Possessor of Great Bounty! O
> Lord! Illumine my face in the day when faces11 have turned
> black and enlighten it with the lights of Thy bountiful Face.
17\. And shouldst thou recite this after ablutions, it would be

> permissible, and this is a grace on the part of thy Lord, the
> Omniscient. When thou hast finished, perfume thyself, then
> attire thyself with thy finest raiment, turn thy face towards
> the Sanctuary of God (the Qiblih), round which at this
> moment the spirits of every existence, whether seen or
> unseen, and those who were not enjoined to prostrate
> themselves before Adam and who have been and will always
> be turned towards the countenance of thy Lord, the Most
> Exalted, the Mighty, the Most High circle.
18\. Then, stand firm in your place, raise thy hands12 towards

God with manifest poise and dignity and say:13
19\. O Lord! I ask Thee by Thy Name, whereby Thou didst shine

> forth upon all beings and didst transcend the entire creation,
> that even as I have anointed myself with this perfume, so
> Thou mayest imbue me with the fragrances of the holy
> paradise14 of Thy mercy and with the breezes wafting the
> savours of the raiment of Thy Self, the Almighty, the
> Luminous, so that none15 may inhale from me but the pure
> scent of Thy Grace and Favour, and I may be wholly turned
> towards Thee and detached from all save Thee. Verily, potent
> art Thou to do as Thou willest, and Thou art, in truth, the
> Bestower, the Pitiful. O Lord! My Beloved,16 my Hope, the
> Possessor of my being and my soul! Send down, at this
> moment, upon Thy servant that which beseemeth the
> sovereignty of Thy generosity and bounty and is worthy of
> the wonders of Thy grace and celestial glory.17 Deprive me
> not, O my God, of the things Thou hast ordained, in the
> heaven of Thy will and the clouds18 of Thy purpose, for Thy
> chosen ones, whom Thou hast singled out for Thine own Self,
> the Almighty, the Beauteous. O Lord! I am poor, and I cling

> to the cord of Thy wealth;19 I am lowly, and I hold fast to the
> rope of Thy might and majesty; I am weak, and I have drawn
> nigh unto the Pavillions of Thy transcendent power and unto
> the glorified Tabernacle of the glory of Thy dominion and
> sovereignty. Therefore, O my God, I am standing before
> Thee, longing for Thy grace, forgetful of anyone except
> Thee, fleeing from all else save Thee, turning towards the
> sanctuary of Thy presence and the goal of Thy good-
> pleasure.20 Is there anyone save Thee to whom21 I may turn?
> Or any manifestation, except Thine Own,22 that I may
> approach? No, by Thy Beauty. All that is manifest is as
> nothing when compared with the revelations of the holy
> lights of Thy greatness. and all that is exalted sinks into
> oblivion when brought before the manifestations of Thy
> glorious highness and loftiness. Send down, then, O my God,
> upon Thy servant that which shall so enrich him as to
> dispense with all the things which have been created in the
> heavens and on the earth. Verily, Thou art the Most Merciful
> of the Merciful.
20\. Then, take three paces forward, turning towards God, and

while taking the first pace say:23
21\. O Lord! Reveal unto me, in this station,24 that which Thou

> didst reveal unto the Speaker (Moses) upon the Paran of Thy
> love, and the Horeb of Thy benevolence, and on the Sinai of
> Thine glorious and most exalted might and mercy! Detach me,
> moreover, O my God, from the Names and their kingdoms,
> lest I be shut out as by a veil, through them, from Him Who
> created them by a command from Him. Thy might, in truth,
> is equal to all things over all things. O my God! Cause me to
> hear, moreover, Thy call from every tree, as Thou didst cause
> Thy servant,25 whom Thou hast chosen and sent to the
> worlds, to hearken to Thy call from the Lote-Tree of Thy
> Cause.

22\. Then take a second pace, stop and say:26
23\. O Lord! Shine forth upon me,27 in this station, as Thou didst

> shine forth upon the Spirit (Jesus), that I may arise to praise
> Thy Self and to proclaim Thy verses among Thy heedless
> servants, perchance thereby their hearts may be cleansed28
> from all doubts and uncertainty regarding Thy Cause, at
> which all, except a few, of them that dwell in the kingdoms
> of names29 swooned away.30 O Lord! Sanctify me, in this
> station,31 from the attributes and their kingdom, that have
> come32 between me and the sight of the splendour of the
358                                Tablet to Jináb-i-Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar

> divine Essence. Give me to drink, moreover, O my God, of
> the cup of immortality from the hands of the remembrance
> of the Name of my Lord, the Exalted, the Most High,33 once
> more.34 Verily, Thou35 art the Lord of immeasurable Grace. O
> Lord! Give me to drink from the stream of everlasting life,
> that I may be set afire by the heat of Thy love, in such wise
> that Thy servants may be inflamed thereof. Cause, moreover,
> the waters (salsabíl) of knowledge to flow out from my
> mouth, in my recognition of Thy Self, the Merciful, that
> through it I may produce Thy proof unto such of Thy
> creatures as trembled on Thy manifest, radiant and
> undeviating path.

24\. Then,36 take a third pace forward, stop and say:37
25\. O Lord! Shine forth upon me,38 in this station, as Thou didst

> shine forth upon all Thy Prophets and Chosen Ones as have
> drawn nigh unto Thee. Then, detach me, O my God, from this
> world and from the world to come, cause me to enter the
> Paradise of Thy presence and39 the Garden of Thy mighty and
> luminous glory.40 O Lord! Blot out from my heart every
> remembrance except Thine,41 that I may arise to praise Thy
> Being42 between earth and heaven. O Lord! Forgive my
> mighty sins, my grievous trespasses, all that in which I have
> failed in my duty towards my Lord, the Exalted, the Most
> High and my hesitation upon the path43 that hath
> encompassed the worlds. O Lord! Attire me with the raiment
> of forgiveness and the robe of certitude. Verily, Thou art He
> Who supplieth the needs of those who seek Him.

26\. Then fall down44 upon the ground and say:45
27\. Praise be to Thee, O my God, for the wonders of Thy

> bounties and the revelations of Thy benevolence towards me,
> inasmuch as Thou taught me the ways of Thy knowledge and46
> the paths of Thy guidance! I beseech Thee, O my God, by the
> light of Thy face, through which all beings have been
> enlightened and the entire creation hath been illumined, not
> to reckon me among them who heard Thy voice and failed to
> answer Thy call, or them unto whom Thou hast revealed Thy
> Being in Thy most exalted manifestation and glorious
> splendour, and did not obey Thee. Then, establish me upon a
> seat of glory nigh unto Thy Name, the Merciful, in the
> garden Thou hast created in the midmost heart of Paradise
> and join me with such of Thy servants as have drawn nigh
> unto Thee. Send down upon me,47 then, every good thing that
> is in Thy knowledge, and cause me to be raised up on the Day

> of Resurrection in the presence of the Manifestation of Thy
> Self, the Inaccessible, the Most Exalted, the Powerful.48
28\. Then lift up thy face from the ground, for thou hast

> completed that which has been prescribed unto thee in this
> lucid Tablet. I swear by the life of Him Whom God shall
> make manifest, whoever performs this action wholly for the
> sake of his Lord and rid of all attachment to all else except
> Him, verily God can satisfy his wants and shall raise him up
> on the day of resurrection in such wise that the company of
> the favoured angels will be bewildered.49 Verily, We have
> instructed and warned thee, that thou mayest attain unto the
> presence of thy Lord and mayest not50 be deprived of what is
> better for thee than the treasures of the heavens and the earth. If
> thou dost perform it, it is for thine own sake, and if thou dost
> neglect it, thy Lord, verily, can well dispense with all creatures.51

\[3\] At this point the so called “ßalát-i-Óájat” begins. Má’idiy-i-Ásmání
