An Epistle of Sayyid ‘Alí Mu˙ammad ‘the Báb’ to Sultan Abdulmecid
                 Some Notes on Early Bábís in the Ottoman Empire
                      introduced and translated by Necati Alkan



Introduction
     n its first days the Bábí community encountered a combined opposition from the Iranian

I    and Ottoman authorities. Sayyid ‘Alí Mu˙ammad Shírází (1819-1850) ‘the Báb,’ the founder
     of the Bábí Religion, commenced the proclamation of His mission to eighteen disciples
from among the followers of the Shaykhí school. He then directed them to go out and spread
the tidings of the advent of the forerunner or gate ( Báb) of the Hidden 12th Imam, al-Mahdi,
in His person, without disclosing His real name. The new movement constituted a real danger
to the Shi‘i clerics in an atmosphere of growing social and economic hardships in times of
decline and the intrusion of Europe in the Middle East. Furthermore, the completion of thou-
sand hijrí years since the Great Occultation of Mu˙ammad al-Mahdi in 1260 (1844-1845) served
as a basis for messianic movements, in particular the Shaykhiyya school, in the Shi‘i holy cities
of Najaf and Karbala in Ottoman Iraq. The triangle of the Ottoman Empire, Iran and the
Sunni/Shi‘i ‘ulama, is important in this context. This paper deals with the rise of the Bábí reli-
gion and the reactions it received from the secular and religious powers vis-à-vis developments,
mainly the religious policy during the Tanzimat (‘reordering period’) in the Ottoman Empire
during early years of Sultan Abdulmecid’s reign (1839-1861) and in particular in the vilâyet
( province) of Iraq ruled by Necib Pafla, followers have in turn responded to the challenges they
faced.

The Historical Context
1.1. Sultan Abdulmecid
  Abdulmecid (1823-1861) was the son of Sultan Mahmud II. (r. 1808-1839) and only sixteen
years old when he ascended the throne. We are told about his personality that he had a grace-
ful ‘girlish’ face, his stature being fragile and slender,1 and that he hated violence and blood-
shed to the extent that he changed the death penalty passed on some of his adversaries who
wanted to kill him, to life-long imprisonment in a citadel. His reign from 1839 until 1861 is
described as an ‘enlightened absolutism’ during the Tanzimat, which was between the rulers
before him and the Birinci Meflrutiyet, the ‘First Constitutional period’ (1876-1908) which
comprises the rules of his brother Abdulaziz and his son Abdulhamid II.2 Ten prime ministers
under Abdulmecid formed twenty-two cabinets, and Mustafa Reflid Pafla, ‘father of Tanzimat,’
who drafted the first reform edict, held six times the office of Sadrâzam ( prime minister).
   Abdulmecid, who became sultan and caliph at a very young age, was a decent and polite per-
son. Academic literature usually emphasises that he sincerely wanted to carry on his father’s
reforms with the same resolution, yet his gentle but weak character obstructed the management
of affairs and his reformist efforts. It was during his reign that imitation of European ways was



                                                                                                1

introduced and luxury and wasteful extravagancy, the building of new palaces and the court’s
expenses resulted in the financial ruin of the state.3 On the whole, he is presented as ‘young
and inexperienced’. 4 He had, however, won the sympathy of the majority of his subjects and,
moreover, the appreciation of particularly Britain and France, basically thanks to the drafting
of the first ( Gülhâne Hatt-ı Hümâyûn, 1839) and the second Tanzimat decrees ( Islâhat
Fermânı, 1856) and their propagation.5
  As to the first reform edict, modern historiography stresses that it was written under Western
influence, its ideas were borrowed from Western political theory and attribute the drafting of
the Gülhane Rescript mainly to Mustafa Reflid Pafla, Sultan Abdulmecid being not involved. A
recent study by Butrus Abu-Manneh, however, provides ample evidence that contradicts this
classical view in that it shows the impact of orthodox Islamic principles of the Naqshbandi-
Mujaddidi order on Sultan Abdulmecid, taught by his mother Bezmiâlem, and the contribution
of several high ranking political and mostly religious leaders in its drafting. In sum, this
rescript was composed in order to respond to the disregard of the sharí’a in governmental and
juridical levels, the prevailing misconduct and injustice by local governors and the sultans
themselves since the 18th century. Furthermore, it appears that not only members of the royal
family were influenced by the teachings of the Naqshbandiyya-Mujaddidiyya but also several
Palace functionaries at the Bâb-ı Âli, the Sublime Porte.6
   At the closing years of Abdulmecid’s reign, however, the Empire had a huge amount of debts
which it could pay only by means of more debts, and the tendencies of more and more ethnic
groups towards autonomy was a proof for its physical disintegration.7 While in the 1840s the
sharí‘a had played an important role in measures for reform, after 1850 they took less and less
account of it, as Ottoman statesmen increasingly borrowed Western secular ideals and ideolo-
gies. During those years Abdulmecid appears too weak as to participate in the decisions of daily
politics and was in the grasp of his grand vizier Mustafa Reflid Pafla. It is reported that the sul-
tan was found slamming his head on the wall while praying to God to liberate him from Reflid’s
clutches.8 The same was the case with Âli Pafla and Fu’ád Pafla who in his and later in the reign
of Abdulaziz held the reins of state affairs in their hands: the sultan had almost no right of
decision in political affairs and seemed to have been a slave of his Paflas. Thus the ‘Young
Ottoman’ reformers’ critique in the 1860s was not directed against the sultan but mainly the
two pillars of the Porte, the ‘well-liked’ Âli and Fu’ád who are remembered by historians as
reform-minded precursors of modern Turkey.9 From the outset of Abdulmecid’s time in power,
he was surrounded by inexperienced wily bureaucrats who involved the unconscious Sultan in
their schemes.10 In the time of Abdulaziz those ‘little despots’ shot out branches into other
governmental institutions and had achieved unrestrained influence whereby they usurped much
power, interfering in all administrative details.11
   For our purpose here, we may look at Abdulmecid’s religious policy. Be it through pressure
from Europe or not, he wanted to unite all of his subjects regardless of race and religion, into
one people as a rampart against nationalism; ‘in one word to nationalize all these fragments of
nations who cover the soil of Turkey, by so much impartiality, gentleness, equality and toler-
ance that each other finds its honour, its conscience in a sort of monarchical confederation
under the auspices of the Sultan.’ 12 Before the proclamation of the first imperial reform edict,
Abdulmecid announced that ‘because God had entrusted to our care the lands and the people
( memálik ve ‘ibád), we have to depend upon divine support and upon the spiritual aid of the
Prophet. Consequently it is our wish to see that the exalted flerí‘at is applied in all matters and
that “all the inhabitants” ( káffeyi ehálí . . . ve beríya) should enjoy tranquility and peace.’ 13 It
is noteworthy that the sultan’s addresses such as this to his ministers to follow ‘the law of jus-



2

tice and equity in all matters,’ to be upright and honest, to eschew bribery and the like were
read in a council meeting and were not concerned with general principles of conduct.14 Still
later, Abdulmecid’s subsequent Islâhat Fermânı underlined the ‘attainment of full happiness for
all classes of our imperial subjects who are bound to one another by the heartfelt bonds of a
common patriotism and are equal in our equitable compassionate view.’ 15 Encouraged by the
atmosphere of religious liberty, Sufi †aríqas flourished again, like the Mevlevi and Bektafli, and
new ones like the Naqshbandi were established in Istanbul.16
1.2. The Rule of Necib Pafla in Ottoman Iraq and the Relationship with Iran
  Despite this atmosphere of religious tolerance in the Ottoman capital, the situation in the
problematic territory of Baghdad was at odds. The conflict between the Sunni Ottomans and
Shi‘i Iranians was aggravated by Shi‘i ‘ulama who during the late 18th and early 19th centuries
were driven by a missionary zeal to convert as many tribes. This can be attributed to several
reasons. An important factor was the religious and psychological motives of the Shi‘i clergymen
with their mentality of a minor sect, which had suffered persecution and restriction to pro-
claim their faith due to the dominance of the majority group. In the 19th century the ‘ulama in
Iraq were engaged in missionary activity on many levels. The Shi‘i among them frequently
engaged their Sunni counterparts and Ottoman officials and even Jewish rabbis in polemical
debates so as to prove the superiority of their sect. And as stated by Shi‘i sources, they always
controlled the situation, which lead to the conversion of the Sunnis to Shi‘a Islam. Shi‘i ‘ulama
were actively proselytising among the ranks of the Ottoman Sixth Army and the police force
in Iraq, as well.17
  From 1831 the Ottomans tried to restore direct central rule in Iraq, superseding Mamluk
rule, which had enjoyed local autonomy since 1747. In 1842 the conservative Gürcü (‘the
Georgian’) Necib Pafla,18 the vâli (governor general) of the Baghdad district came to power and
embarked upon the task of centralising Ottoman rule there, ‘by force if necessary.’ He was also
known for opposing religious minorities. Necib Pafla was granted complete powers and rights
and assigned ‘the implementation of the Tanzimat’ of direct and centralised rule. Early in his
career he became a follower of the Mujaddidiyya, a branch of the religious order of the
Naqshbandiyya, founded by Shaykh Khalid. Necib was a deeply believing Sunni, and the con-
cept of Islam he favoured was Sufism. Thus, in his seven years as governor general in Baghdad
he not only promoted his own Khalidiyya order but also the Qadiriyya. On the other hand, he
neglected traditional Islamic institutions like mosques and madrasas. His disrespectful treat-
ment of the mufti Shaykh Mahmud al-Alusi shows Necib’s religious inclinations. A similar pol-
icy towards regarding Sufism can be seen later in the reign of Abdulhamid II, when Mahmud
Nedim Pafla—son of Necib—was advisor to the sultan.19
  Necib’s appointment as vâli was in the eyes of the sultan ‘acceptable to reason.’ 20 And when
Necib demanded for Karbala to be an Ottoman stronghold, and in view of the hostilities
between the Empire and Iran, he was not willing to ‘leave in his rear a populous town, con-
taining many Persians, and governed by a set of lawless vagabonds . . . [who] defied the Sultan’s
authority, with a powerful tribe of Arabs close at hand ready to assist them in case of emer-
gency.’ 21 He decided to put an end to Iranian ‘oppression’ because Karbala belonged to the
Sultan by virtue of hereditary right, and that the sanctity of the city was no reason for Iranians
to live their in great numbers. Following some clashes with tribal and gang leaders, the
Ottomans violently took Karbala in January 1843.2 2
1.3. The Rise of the Bábí Faith
  In addition to the hostility between Sunnis and Shi‘is and the disregard of especially the Shi‘i



                                                                                                3

‘ulama of Ottoman rule, the intensified messianic expectations at the beginning of the mil-
lennium of Imam Mahdi’s occultation in the year 1260/1844 worsened the Ottoman-Iranian
crisis. Necib Pafla was labelled as ‘Yazid,’ thus equating him with the much-hated Umayyad
caliph who had instigated Imam Husayn’s death at Karbala. Shi‘i poets begged the Hidden Imam
to return and liberate his people from Ottoman oppression who were the usurpers: 23 ‘[ T]he
modern Karbala tragedy was seen by many Shi‘is as cataclysmic events preceding the awaited
appearance of the Mahdi. It heightened messianic expectations in Shi‘ism, which were already
rising due to the approaching millennium of the Occultation of the 12th Imam, and apparent-
ly facilitated the appearance of the Bábí claims at least within the Shaykhí community.’ 24 The
Bábí Religion with its roots in the messianic Shaykhi movement within Shi‘a Islam, was a threat
to the Sunni officials who were traumatised by the conversions of not only Sunni tribes but
also Ottoman officials to Shi‘ism; so they wanted to prevent further rebellions.
  After Sayyid KáΩim-i Rashtí’s (Shaykh A˙mad’s successor) refusal to designate a successor, the
Shaykhís split in different groups, one headed by Mullá Óusayn Bushrú’í. He refused all candi-
dates for succession and decided to retire for fasting and devotional acts with his friends in
order to seek guidance, as was customary for seminary students. It was Mullá Óusayn who first
accepted the Báb’s claim to be the Promised One at a meeting in the Báb’s house in Shiraz (22
May 1844). Before going Himself to the ˙ajj and His intended visit to the Shrine cities of
Najaf and Karbala to announce His appearance ( Ωuhúr) and proclaim His mission, the Báb dis-
patched Mullá Óusayn to Tehran and Khorasan. Another disciple, Mullá ‘Alí Bas†ámí, was sent
as an emissary to the holy land,’ 25 the ‘Atabat, with the purpose of spreading the Báb’s message
before His arrival there. Bas†ámí’s task was to win over the Shaykhís and Shi‘i mujtahids for
the Báb’s cause.
1.4. The Trial of Mullá ‘Alí Bas†ámí, the Báb’s messenger
   In mid-summer the same year Mullá ‘Alí arrived in Iraq. The Báb had entrusted him with a
message to the Shaykhi community, which was in the middle of an unsettled dispute over lead-
ership after Rashtí. Bas†ámí could convince a significant number of Shaykhis. In Najaf
Bas†ámí met Mu˙ammad Óasan Najafí,26 then the highest Shi‘i cleric, and gave him portions
of the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’ , one of the earliest and most important writings of the Báb. In
Najafí’s assembly Mullá ‘Alí declared that the Promised One had appeared in Shiraz and should
be accepted as the only legitimate religious source of authority in Islam and that His book
supersedes all former holy books. Bas†ámí’s statements caused an uproar among those present
and Najafí, being an enemy of heterodoxies and heresies, instantly pronounced Bas†ámí a
heretic. This was a serious challenge to the orthodoxy and authority of the ‘ulama. Headed by
Najafí, the mujtahids of Najaf and Karbala condemned the message Bas†ámí had delivered as a
blasphemy. The Báb’s envoy was captured and a letter was sent to the government in Baghdad
where he was charged with stirring up mischief and uttering slanders against Islam and
Mu˙ammad.27 This decision was agreed upon also to lessen the impact of messianic tensions
in the Shi‘i holy land as manifested by a considerable number of pilgrims. Otherwise this could
lead to another conflict and defeat by the Ottoman authorities.28
  Bas†ámí was transferred to Baghdad. The governor Necib Pafla put him on trial by a special
commission consisting of high-ranking Sunni and Shi‘i ‘ulama, headed by the mufti Shaykh
Ma˙múd al-Alúsí. This was apparently the first of its kind in Ottoman history, for it is not
recorded that ‘ulama of the two factions had gathered in a joint assembly to try somebody. One
account of the trial states that this meant that the Ottoman government officially acknowledged
the Shi‘a.29 But although non-Muslim communities were given legal autonomy as part of their
millet-system, in fact the Ottomans refused to confer the Shi‘is the status of a separate millet


4
                          An Epistle of the Báb to Sultan Abdulmecid


(‘religious nation’), as the Shi‘is were not a protected minority ( dhimmí ) according to Sunni law,
but sinning Muslims. And granting them an independent millet status would be the same as
their exclusion from Islam and a separate religion like the Christian and Jewish millets.30
Consequently the Bas†ámí affair was a welcome opportunity for Iran to complain about the
Ottoman’s infringement upon the rights of Shi‘i subjects in Iraq.31
   Despite Mullá ‘Alí Bas†ámí’s rejection by the Shi‘i ‘ulama around Najafí, he had success in
disseminating his call among theological students who struggled with the strenuous orthodox
Islamic learning. Whereas the Shi‘i ‘ulama denounced him as a heretic and wanted him to be
expelled to Iran and his writings destroyed, the Sunni clerics sanctioned this and accused
Bas†ámí of blasphemy. He should be punished by death penalty. The accounts of the trial dif-
fer from each other.32 On the other hand, as Abbas Amanat puts it, the ‘new heresy’ provided
a consensus despite the traditional enmities between the Sunni Ottomans and Shi‘i Iranians.
The joint fatwá condemned it, and as a turning point in their relations demonstrated that
longstanding doctrinal disputes could be temporarily settled in view of a threat that could
cause a new schism among Muslims, and to a certain extent reduced the ‘already dim prospects
of a Bábí mass success’ in the holy cities in Iraq and stood for the imminent enmities the new
creed would face.33
  In Necib Pafla’s report to the Sublime Porte we read that a certain Mullá ‘Alí from Bas†ám in
Khorasan, pupil of the late dissident mujtahid Sayyid KáΩim in Karbala who led people astray,
came ‘two months ago’ (end of November 1844) to Najaf and showed to some people a book
composed of verses from the Qur’a n which were blended with certain kinds of heretical fabri-
cations. Bas†ámí had stated, ‘This book is divine revelation. It is incumbent upon us to act
according to its laws. On the tenth day in the month of Mu˙arram the Mahdi will come from
Mecca to Karbala and manifest Himself. Await his coming.’ He proceeded to Karbala and
repeated his comments and showed his book to all sorts of people. Bas†ámí thereby secretly
won over some hundred heretics ( mülhed), and the book was copied. Necib points out that
unless this situation, which entails unprecedented mischief ( fesâdât-ı azîme) and is harmful to
the Ottoman Empire and the Islamic world, is noticed; it will change the minds of many igno-
rant persons from among diverse people ( milel-i muhtelife ve cehele) and in particular mostly
heretical tribes ( aflâir-i vükerâ), and mislead them from the straight path. Necib Pafla then cites
what Bas†ámí said at the interrogation:
  When I was about to return from my native land [ Iran] to here, a man from among the
  sayyids [i.e., the Báb] ordered me and entrusted me [with the message]: “You are going to
  Baghdad; take this book and give it to the mujtahids in Najaf and Karbala. Tell them that
  I am the ná’ib [deputy] of the Mahdi. I will go to ˙ajj this year and from the ˙ajj I will go
  to Karbala. The Mahdi will manifest Himself in [the month of] Mu˙arram in Karbala.” I
  directly went to Najaf. All the ‘ulama were assembled in one place. I took the book and
  gave it to them and conveyed what the sayyid had said. They opened the book; each of them
  read one or two sheets of it and then threw it away. They did not treat me with courtesy.
  Two days later I came to Karbala. The aforesaid book was circulated, and they sent [me] to
  Karbala. The sheets were brought together there, and the kâ’im-makâm [the local gover-
  nor] arrested me and sent me to you.
Upon asking Bas†ámí who sent this book and what his name was and if he had the whole book
with him, he responded, ‘The book I took with me should consist of approximately sixteen,
seventeen portions. But I do not know the sayyid’s name or the content of the book.’ Necib
says that this was a manifest lie ( kezb-i sarîh), and every time Bas†ámí was tried, he gave con-
tradictory answers. In addition, according to people possessed of information, the book in


                                                                                                  5
                                   Lights of ‘Irfán Book Four


question was evidently the composition of his master Sayyid KáΩim, and Bas†ámí one of his
rebellious followers. Even in prison when two ostensibly uninformed men from among the local
people were imprisoned in order to befriend him and come around to an opinion during their
conversations, asked Bas†ámí why he was imprisoned; he recounted his aforementioned state-
ments to them and added that he will not recant his beliefs even if he were killed. Considering
Bas†ámí’s repeated denials and because the writings he had with him could be dispersed among
all kinds of people and result in an unpleasant situation, the heretics (Shaykhis?) in Najaf,
Karbala and Kazimayn who profess to be mujtahids, were transferred to an assembly compris-
ing several ‘ulama and the Iranian consul. There the confiscated writings were read and exam-
ined. It was concluded that those contained sheer blasphemies and the author is an infidel.
Necib Pafla finally adds that he cautioned the people that should anyone read those texts and
consent with its contents, he will be punished according to sharí‘a regulations and that he is
willing to enact whatever is decreed by the Sultan regarding Bas†ámí’s fate.34
  In a second report Necib Pafla notes that although Bas†ámí is detained in prison in Baghdad
following the verdict passed on him, it was proposed that it would be more appropriate to send
Bas†ámí to Istanbul in order to prevent mischief because of the manifest blasphemies
(küfriyyât-ı sarîha) in the writings he was carrying. It was anticipated that if he were set free,
his presence in Baghdad would cause rumour among the people and the ‘ulama would be dis-
turbed by his grievous and infamous crime ( fazîha-yı azîme).35
  Later, in a memorandum from the Sadrâzam ( prime minister) Rauf Pafla36 to Sultan
Abdulmecid it was stated that it was understood in a recent consultation that if the messenger
of the Mahdi remains imprisoned in Baghdad this will cause a dispute and provoke remarkable
annoyance; he therefore should be send to Mosul and afterwards be dealt with. However,
because the situation in Mosul was not much different from Baghdad and the ‘ulama’s rebellion
there had manifested itself at another instance, it was more appropriate that he be send to the
town of Bolu.37 And from there he may be send further ‘to one of the islands ( adalardan
birine)’ where he can be further dealt with. It has been suggested that the word for ‘island’ reads
jazíra or cezîre in Ottoman Turkish and could have meant Cyprus, Crete or Rhodes,38 or even
Algeria.39 While it is true that those islands were traditional places of exile, it is not likely that
Algeria is meant here because in Turkish it is Cezayir. Moreover, the original text does not say
cezîre, but ada, being the Turkish word for ‘island’. 4 0
  In the same memorandum mention is made that the local governor of Bolu was informed of
the danger the book constitutes and is not to be exposed to the public, but should be burned
and destroyed. Abdulmecid approved the report of the Prime Minister.41 Yet obviously the
decision was altered. After the arrival of Mullá ‘Alí Bas†ámí to Istanbul, the Sublime Porte
referred his case again to Abdulmecid. This time it was suggested that if Bas†ámí was send to
an island, his activities could not be controlled; he might not keep his tongue and could con-
vert the people to his false ideas. Hence he should be put to hard labour imprisonment with
exile, or kürek, literally condemnation to the ‘galleys,’ in the imperial naval yard. Again, the
Sultan approved this decision.42
  A report in Persian, probably written by the then Persian charge d’affairs in Istanbul, throws
some light on Bas†ámí’s fate. We learn that the Ottoman authorities had ‘summoned him to a
gathering and inquired about certain matters, and he, without practicing taqíyya, made certain
verbal confessions. Therefore according to the declaration of the ‘ulama of Baghdad and in view
of his own confessions, for a while he was sent for forced labor ( kürek).’ And that on his way
to Istanbul ‘he was held for a while in Búlí [ Bolu], before being removed to the capital.’ One
month after Bas†ámí’s confinement at the imperial dockyard, the Persian representative in the


6
                          An Epistle of the Báb to Sultan Abdulmecid


Ottoman capital protested at this decision, saying that he must be sent back to Iran, since he
was a Persian subject and ‘if he is found guilty of any charges, he will be punished by the exalt-
ed Persian government.’ But the Ottoman authorities ‘first denied that he was a Persian subject
by claiming that he had been a citizen of Baghdad, but after long persistence they gave way.’
About his tragic end it is said: ‘When they sent orders to lift his chains and release him from
forced labor, he had already passed away a few days earlier and come to the mercy of God.’ As
Amanat points out, we do not know the exact cause of his death.43
  Bas†ámí’s appearance and the incidents associated with him not only caused an uproar among
Shi‘i and Sunni ‘ulama circles but also led to the acceptance of his message by large numbers,
especially among the Shaykhis. This was the first conflict between ‘ulama in Bahá’í history, and
the religious and secular opposition which Bas†ámí had met changed the Báb’s own plans to go
to the holy cities of Iraq after His ˙ajj, and thus changed the course of events in early Bábí his-
tory.44

The Báb’s Epistle to Sultan Abdulmecid
2.1 Circumstances and Response to the Ottomans
  The Báb heard of Bas†ámí’s arrest while He was still in the Arabian Peninsula performing the
˙ajj. According to Abu’l-Qásim Afnán’s account of the Báb,45 the Báb asked Mullá Óasan
Gawhar (who saw himself as the leader of the Shaykhi school and successor of Sayyid KáΩim)
to deliver an epistle to the Caliph-Sultan Abdulmecid via Necib Pafla and to arrange for the
release of Mullá ‘Alí Bas†ámí. Unfortunately the initiatives did not take place, and instead
Gawhar signed the death warrant and condemnation ( takfír) of the Báb and His disciple in the
joint Sunni-Shi‘i fatwá. In addition, we do not know whether the Báb’s letter in which He
pleaded for justice, ever reached Abdulmecid.
  Afnan does moreover say that according to Báb’s Khu†batu’l-Jidda46 He returned from
Mecca to Masqat around Rabi‘ al-Awwal 1261/ca. 10 March 1845. He stayed in Mosqat for a
while to proclaim His mission to some local ‘ulama and arranged for the release of His disci-
ple from the hands of the vâli of Baghdad and the ‘ulama.47 Furthermore, Afnan writes, after
His return from Mecca the Báb sent letters to Mu˙ammad Sháh, the Iranian prime minister
Óájí Mírzá Áqásí, Sultan Abdulmecid and Gawhar from Bushihr in Iran and Masqat in present
Oman (March/April 1845) to bring about the release of Bas†ámí from the prison of Necib
Pafla.48
  The Tablet the Báb intended to send to Sultan Abdulmecid is one of His early works.49 Shoghi
Effendi makes a note of the ‘Tablets to Sul†án ‘Abdu’l-Majíd and to Najíb Páshá, the Válí of
Baghdád’. 50 Whereas Denis MacEoin mentions this in his bibliography of the Báb’s early works
and was not aware of the original Tablets or copies,51 the Tablet to Abdulmecid is extant at the
Bahá’í World Centre.52 There is no copy among the documents related to Bas†ámí’s trial at the
Baflbakanlık Arflivi in Istanbul.53 We may assume that the Tablets neither reached Abdulmecid
nor Necib Pafla. As to the Tablet to the latter, the Bahá’í World Centre could not locate It in its
archives.
   Overall, there are some addresses of the Báb to kings. In an epistle to Mu˙ammad Sháh
(written some time in mid-May 1845, after His pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina), the Báb sum-
mons him to gather ‘the believers in God’s oneness’ (the ‘ulama?) to His presence and to deliv-
er them a letter which He has received from the ‘Remembrance of God’ and to bring forward
a single verse as He did. Then, speaking of Mullá ‘Alí Bas†ámí’s trial in Baghdad, the Báb asks
the Sháh to send ‘the letter of your Lord’ to Sultan Abdulmecid and all other kings.54 Elsewhere

the Báb commands the kings to ‘[d]eliver with truth and in all haste the verses sent down by
Us to the peoples of Turkey and of India, and beyond them, with power and with truth, to
lands in both the East and the West . . . ’. 55
2.2. The Contents of the Epistle to Abdulmecid
   The Báb begins His Tablet to the Ottoman Sultan with the Qur’a nic Bismi’lláhi’r-Ra˙máni’r-
Ra˙ím, the glorification of God. He says that ‘this Book is the decree of God’ ( ˙ukmu’lláh) for
those on earth, sent down ( nuzzila) from His ‘Servant ‘Alí, the All-Wise’ ( min ladun ‘abdihi
‘alí ˙akím), i.e. the Báb, Who is the ‘path of God in the heavens and on earth’ ( ßirá†u’lláh fí’s-
samáwát wa’l-ar∂).56 He advises the people to come forth for the Covenant of Baqiyyatu’lláh
(‘Remnant of God’),57 the ‘living, undoubted Leader’ ( imám ˙ayy mubín), Who is the ‘Book
wherein there is no doubt’ ( kitáb lá rayba fíh) and calls men to the ‘straight path’ ( ßirá† qawím).
The Báb identifies Himself as the ‘Mystery in the heavens’ ( as-sirr fí’s-samáwát), conveying
the ‘Cause from the presence of the Remnant of God’ who is the ‘light from the right side of
the Mount [Sinai]’ ( an-núr ‘an yamín a†-†úr).
    The Báb then addresses Abdulmecid:
    Read the Book of thy Lord, O Majíd, through the command of thy Lord in the preserved
    Book ( kitáb ˙afíΩ). Know thou that God hath knowledge of all things in the heavens and
    on earth, and that thou art concerning the verdict passed on the messenger ( rasúl, i.e.
    Bas†ámí), the lord of great oppression ( wa má kunta fí ˙ukmi’r-rasúl la-dhú Ωulm ‘aΩím).
    Fear God, O thou man ( rajul), for today there is no escape for anyone ( fa-inna’l-yawma lá
    mafarr li-a˙ad) except he believeth in the signs of thy Lord and is accounted among those
    who prostrate [ before Him].
Likewise, the Book was sent down for the kings ( al-mulúk) that they might learn of the com-
mand of a new creation ( bad‘ ) from the Remnant of God.
   After commanding the Sultan to read this Epistle, the Báb asks him to assemble the people
of learning ( úlú’l-‘ilm, ‘ulama) in his presence and to deliver them on behalf of the
‘Remembrance of God’ ( Dhikru’lláh), to read His Book with justice and to be fair in their
judgment. For God has knowledge of all things and ‘He ordaineth the Day of Judgment ( yawm
al-qiyáma) among all with equity ( qis†).’ 58 One single verse of ‘this Book,’ the Báb says, is suf-
ficient and equals the verses that were previously sent down to Mu˙ammad’s heart ( qalb), and
through it the ‘testimony of God’ ( ˙ujjatu’lláh) has been completed. ‘We make no distinction
between the Messengers of God, and to them do we bow our will’ ( Inná na˙nu lá nufarriqu
bayna a˙adin min rusuli’lláhi wa-inná la-hum muslimún).59
  Among the addressees in this Tablet are also the inhabitants of Istanbul ( mala’ min ahl ar-
Rúm). They are warned to fear God and not to follow the command of †ághút lest they be reck-
oned as the ‘people of the fire’ ( úlá’ika hum aß˙áb an-nár). The Qur’a nic †ághút60 is usually
translated as ‘the evil,’ ‘the one who exceeds all bounds,’ ‘transgressor,’ ‘the Satan’ or ‘false
deities/gods’. Those who disbelieve in †ághút and believe in God hold the ‘sure handle’ ( al-
‘urwatu’l-wuthqá). But those who disbelieve, their patrons are †ághút; they are led from light
to darkness and will be the companions of the fire wherein they abide ( úlá’ika hum aß˙áb an-
nár fíhá khálidún), while the believers’ patron is God who leads them from darkness to light.61
The people of †ághút whom God has cursed and left without a helper, say that the disbelievers
are better guided than the believers. Those misguided are so greedy that they do not give their
fellow men even a speck in a date stone.62 Outwardly they speak of their belief in God’s
prophets but in reality they resort to the judgment of †ághút, although they are forbidden to
do so. Thus Satan misleads them.63 The believers in God who fight in the way of God are asked
to fight ‘the friends of Satan’ ( awliyá’ ash-shay†án).64

8
                         An Epistle of the Báb to Sultan Abdulmecid


   The Báb also states that God bears witness to ‘His Servant ‘Alí in the Qur’án’ and that He
is ‘the path of God in the heavens and on earth . . . He verily is the heir of the Messenger of
God ( waßíy rasúli’lláh) in the lucid Book ( kitáb mubín).’ The following verse, ‘And on this day
the dominion belongeth to one from His progeny,’ again refers to Himself, as He was a descen-
dant of Mu˙ammad. These statements are crucial in that the Báb establishes the fulfilment of
prophecies for the establishment of the Hidden Imam, the Mahdi. The Báb challenges the
accepted reading of the phrase ßirátá ‘alayya mustaqím, ‘This is a straight path incumbent upon
me,’ in Q. 15:41. The Báb renders it as ßirá† ‘alí mustaqím, which means ‘the straight path of
‘Alí.’65 The beauty and interpretation of this verse is also echoed in other instances: ‘Verily
God is My Lord and your true Lord, therefore worship Him, while this Path from ‘Alí [the Báb]
is none but the straight Path in the estimation of your Lord.’66 And further, ‘Verily God hath
revealed unto Me that the Path of the Remembrance which is set forth by Me is, in the very
truth, the straight Path of God. . . .’67
  The Báb then asks the people to bring forward a proof from the Qur’a n if they have doubts
regarding this command. His verses are the same as those of the Qur’a n which were revealed to
the Seal of the Prophets ( khátam an-nabiyyín), and that He is ‘the One who leadeth aright to
the path of God’ or the ‘Mahdi of the path of God’ ( mahdí ßirá† Alláh). One verse revealed by
the Báb equals the verses previously revealed by the Prophets. ‘We have delivered the decree of
God in the Mother of the cities ( ummu’l-qurá) [ Mecca] and its surroundings in three Books,’
thereby probably alluding to Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’ , Ía˙ífa Bayna’l-Óaramayn and another book.
Hence the people must follow the Cause of God in order to attain happiness. And should one
of them die disregarding God’s command, he is accounted of the people of the fire on the Day
of Judgment. ‘And whosoever repudiateth Our verses and leaveth not his home emigrating to
the city of the Remembrance ( muhájiran ilá balad adh-Dhikr), We will send down his judgment
in the Book, like We have done in the Qur’a n regarding Abu Lahab,’ a reference to Mu˙ammad’s
uncle, titled ‘father of the flame,’ and His fiery enemy, mentioned in Sura 111.
  Once more, the Báb castigates Abdulmecid:
  O thou man ( rajul)! Thou hast followed Satan ( shay†án)65 regarding the verdict to imprison
  the messenger of the Remembrance ( rasúl adh-Dhikr). Fear God after thou hast read a sin-
  gle wondrous letter ( ˙arfan badí‘an) from Our Book. Do not repudiate the command of
  God and send the messenger in accordance with the command We have send down in the
  Book addressed to thee . . . Thou art not aware of the matter of the caliphate ( khiláfa).
  The messenger is a weak servant in those lands. Yet know full well that it is We that sent
  him . . . Know thou God’s decree and send him after [thou hast read] this Book. . . . Follow
  God’s command, O Majíd, and not thine idle imaginings that lead thee astray from the
  path of God ( sabíl).
  Would Sultan Abdulmecid have acted in favour of Mullá ‘Alí Bas†ámí if he had received the
Báb’s epistle? We do not know, but it is known that he later pursued favourable policies towards
the Bábís on two subsequent occasions. The first is regarding Fá†ima Baraghání or ‘ˇáhirih,’
the noted and only female disciple of the Báb;69 the second is the respectful manner in which
Abdulmecid approached Bahá’u’lláh during His exile in Baghdad.
  ˇáhirih was a famous poetess and scholar, well-versed and eloquent in Islamic theology and
very successful in the proclamation of the new Bábí creed both in Iran and in Ottoman Iraq,
especially in Najaf and Karbala. Her success in converting many to Bábism in Karbala provoked
the jealousy and anger of the Shi‘i ‘ulama, to such an extent that guards had to be placed at her
house for protection. In order to prevent further annoyance she was granted permission by the
Ottoman government to leave for Baghdad.70


                                                                                                 9
                                   Lights of ‘Irfán Book Four


  In Baghdad ˇáhirih was hosted in the house of the chief mufti Mahmud al-Alusi, the same
individual who a short time earlier had been the leading mulla who issued a fatwá condemn-
ing Mullá ‘Alí Bas†ámí and the Báb. Al-Alusi seems to have later changed his attitude towards
Bábism because, according to a Bahá’í source,71 in his seminal work Rúh al-Ma‘ání he wrote
positively of conversations he had with ˇáhirih. In these unconfirmed references al-Alusi states
that he shares her beliefs but, because of the fear of being punished by the Ottomans, he was
not able to utter this publicly.72 In Baghdad, ˇáhirih continued spreading the Bábí Faith freely,
which caused a great outcry among the divines. The issue was taken to the governor general
Necib Pafla who asked Istanbul whether ˇáhirih was allowed to continue spreading Bábí teach-
ings. Three months later, an order was received from Sultan Abdulmecid to release her under the
condition that she stop advocating the Bábí Faith and leave the Ottoman empire.73
  About a decade later, when Bahá’u’lláh was in exile in Baghdad, Sultan Abdulmecid seems to
have received positive reports about Him from various governors:
     So struck, indeed, had the Sul†án ‘Abdu’l-Majíd been by the favorable reports received
     about Bahá’u’lláh from successive governors of Baghdád (this is the personal testimony
     given by the Governor’s deputy to Bahá’u’lláh Himself) that he consistently refused to
     countenance the requests of the Persian government either to deliver Him to their repre-
     sentative or to order His explusion from Turkish territory.74
  In Kurdistan Bahá’u’lláh had personal contacts with distinguished Sufi shaykhs, among
whom He had won the heart of Shaykh ‘Uthman, the leader of the Naqshbandiyya Order. As
noted previously, Sultan Abdulmecid was a follower of that order, and we are told by Shoghi
Effendi that Abdulmecid was an adherent of Shaykh ‘Uthman.75 It is quite possible that the
Sultan’s high regard of Bahá’u’lláh was increased through this relationship.

                           An Epistle of the Báb to Sultan Abdulmecid


        Epistle of Sayyid ‘Alí Mu˙ammad ‘the Báb’ to Sultan Abdulmecid*

  In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.
   Praise be to Him Who hath sent the Book unto whosoever He willeth among His servants.
Verily, there is none other God beside Him, the All-Possessing, the All-Praised. In His grasp He
holdeth the kingdom of all things. Nothing escapeth His knowledge. There is none other God
beside Him. Say: Him do all worship. Verily, this Book is a command from God unto all who
are on earth. Issue forth from your cities for the Covenant of the Remnant of God, the living,
the undoubted Leader [Imám]. He is indeed the Book wherein there is no doubt,76 sent down
from the presence of His Servant ‘Alí, the All-Wise. And He, verily, is ‘Alí, the All-Wise, the
Path of God77 in the heavens and on the earth. He calls the people to the Straight Path at the
bidding of thy Lord. He verily is the Mystery of the heavens, Who commands from the Presence
of the Remnant of God, the true and undoubted Leader. He, verily, is the Light from the right
side of the Mount Sinai in the Book of thy Lord. There is no God but Me. Say: Him do they
all fear.
   Read the Book of thy Lord, O Majíd, through the command of thy Lord in the preserved
Book. Know thou that God hath knowledge of all things in the heavens and on the earth, and
that thou art concerning the verdict passed on the messenger [ Bas†ámí], possessed of great
wrongdoing. Fear God, O thou man! For today no place is there for anyone to flee except he
believeth in the signs of God and is accounted among those who worship Him. We have sent
down a Book unto the kings that they learn of the command of the new creation from the pres-
ence of the Remnant of God, the just and true Leader. Thus was sent down the Book. Gather
them that are possessed of knowledge [‘ulama] in thy presence, and say unto them on behalf of
the Remembrance of God: Read ye the Book of God with justice and be ye fair in the presence
of God in what it ordaineth. God, verily, ordaineth the Day of Judgment among all with equi-
ty. He in truth is the All-Knowing, the All-Powerful. O concourse [of ‘ulama?]! Bear ye witness
that the Testimony of God is completed for you after reading the verses of this Book. God, ver-
ily, is the omniscient Witness. O concourse! Fear ye God and judge fairly: Is there any distinc-
tion in the sovereignty of God, whether one verse or several verses were to be revealed? Nay, by
the Qur’án! We make no distinction between the Messengers of God, and to God do we bow
our will.78 If the Qur’án was sent down as a single verse, how could anyone be able to fathom
the matter and say something with respect to it and utter such words? Sanctified be God from
those who join partners with Him. Sufficient is the Book for this as a witness to all in the
heavens and the earth, and God is the omniscient Witness. Were men to gather in order to read
a Book like this, which We have sent down now unto thee, they shall not and never will be able
to do this, even if the Jinn were to assist them79 despite their weakness. God is the All-
Informed, the All-Knowing. And We have sent down a Book aforetime; in it are evident vers-
es from Our presence to a people with hearing ears. Verily those who follow the verses of God
in truth, they are the rightly guided; and those who follow their vain imaginings, they are the
transgressors. O concourse of the people of Istanbul! Fear God, thy Lord, the Compassionate,
regarding this decree. He verily is the Truth, even as ye have believed in the Covenant of
God.80 Those who have joined partners with God have followed the command of the Evil One
( †ághút) after [some words missing in text], such are rightful owners of the Fire. They will
abide therein,81 according to the Book of God.

   God beareth witness to His Servant ‘Alí in the Qur’án. He, verily, is the Path of God in the
heavens and on earth.82 Nothing escapeth His knowledge. He is verily the heir of the
Messenger of God [ Mu˙ammad] in a lucid Book. The heir of the dominion today is someone
from His progeny and a true Leader. He is the One in Whose hand is the kingdom of all cre-
ation and all are powerless before His might. And at the behest of the Book all creatures are
submissive to Him. If ye have any doubts concerning this Command then depart from the com-
mand of the Qur’án. God hath verily sent down these verses, as He hath sent down the Qur’án
to the heart of the Apostle of God, the Seal of the Prophets. And with the permission of God
He hath sent down to the heart of Him Whom He hath made the Proof for those in the heav-
ens and on earth. Verily, He is the One who leadeth aright to the Path of God in a lucid Book.
I, verily, am a Servant and have believed in God and His verses and what He hath sent down
in the Qur’án from One, mighty and wise. Say: I verily do deliver the Cause with the permis-
sion of God from the true and mighty Leader. He is in truth the Mystery in the Mother Book
upon an ancient Edifice.83 Know ye, O people of the earth, that on this day nobody can escape
the Cause of God. All will return to God on the Day of Resurrection. One verse, which We sent down
unto you, now equals the verses of the Prophets in accordance with the Book of God. Afterwards, all
the people will ask about the proofs of God.
   We have delivered the Command of your Lord in the Mother of the Cities [Mecca] and to
those in her vicinity, in three Books of verses of truth. Say: Follow the Cause of God that per-
chance ye may be of them with whom it shall be well. If someone amongst you should die
rejecting this Command, verily he is among the people of Fire on the Day of Resurrection and
will be amongst those who are gathered [in God’s Presence]. Send thou a Book like unto this
Book to the King in that land in golden ink that perchance ye may be among the helpers. He
who disbelieveth in our verses and doth not leave his house emigrating to the City of the
Remembrance, We shall send down his verdict in the Book, the like of which hath been sent
with regard to Abu Lahab in the Qur’án.84 Fear God, O concourse, and have mercy on your-
selves. And bring not shame upon yourselves should ye have fear of that which hath been
revealed unto after God’s decree hath come to and these verses have been recited.
   O thou man! Thou hast followed Satan regarding the verdict to imprison the messenger of
the Remembrance. Fear God after thou hast read a single wondrous letter from Our Book. Do
not repudiate the command of God and send the messenger [ back] in accordance with the com-
mand We have sent down in the Book addressed to thee according to a mighty and wondrous
command. Thou art not aware of the matter of the caliphate. The messenger is a weak servant
in those lands. Yet know thou full well that it is We that sent him. We, verily, art potent over
all things. We, verily, bear witness unto everything. We, verily, art powerful over all things
with the permission of God. Know thou God’s decree and send him after [thou hast read] this
Letter. Verily do We write the decree of thy death at thine own hands, and We art aware of
what We accomplish. Follow God’s command, O Majíd, and not thine idle imaginings that mis-
lead thee from the path of God. God’s decree is naught but a manifest announcement. Exalted
is God, thy Lord, the Lord of might, from what they do ascribe unto Him. Peace be unto the
emigrants and praised be God, the Lord of all worlds!

    a so-called early history of the Bábí religion. Mírzá Abu’l-Fa∂l died before he could finish it. His nephew
    Sayyid Mahdi did it in his stead, and it was published in Ashqabad. But because Sayyid Mahdi had stepped
    beyond the limits of modesty and the book contained some factual errors, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stopped its circu-
    lation.
