Rue St Didier 30  
Paris  
France  
To His Honour Mr D. Graham Pole, upon him be Baha-o-llah, El-Abha  
Edinburgh, Scotland  
  
He is God!  
O thou revered Friend!  
  
Thy letter was received. Its contents indicated that that illumined lady soared toward the Kingdom of the Merciful. Alas! that such a light which was shining in your Society has become extinguished, but it has become radiant in the Lamp of the Kingdom. She has obtained the Eternal Light. Therefore be ye not Sad!  
The Magazines which you forwarded were received. I am most grateful to you for this Service. I will pray in thy behalf and beg for thee Divine Confirmation so that in Scotland thou mayest upraise the Banner of the Oneness of the World of humanity through the Assistance of Bah-o-llah and become the promoter of the heavenly Teachings which are the Spirit of this Age! May you always see His Holiness Baha-o-llah as your helper and assistant.  
  
Convey longing greeting to all the friends!  
Upon thee be Baha-El Abha!  
(Sig) Abdul Baha Abbas !
