## Regarding Jaʻfar-i-Kadhdháb ('Jaʻfar the Liar')

### by [Bahá'u'lláh](https://bahai-library.com/author/Bahá'u'lláh)

translated by [Adib Ma'sumian](https://bahai-library.com/author/Adib%20Ma'sumian).

In a Tablet to Mírzá Áqáy-i-Afnán, the Pen of the Most High—exalted be His glory—hath revealed:

> “O people of God! Inquire ye of the people of the Qurʼán: ‘Where is Jábulqá, and what of Jábulsá? \[1\] What hath become of those illusory cities?’ They have condemned as a liar that hapless Jaʻfar, \[2\] who did not speak falsely. For uttering a single truthful remark, he hath been branded a liar from the early days of Islám to the present time. ‘God’s malison on the head of the people of tyranny!’” \[3\]

**Notes:**

\[1\] cf. Baháʼuʼlláh, _Gems of Divine Mysteries_, para. 47, note 7: “According to Shíʻih traditions, the twin cities of Jábulqá and Jábulsá are the dwelling place of the Hidden Imám (the Promised One), whence He will appear on the Day of Resurrection.”

\[2\] The brother of Imám Ḥasan ʻAskarí, known to Twelver Shíʻihs as “Jaʻfar-i-Kadhdháb” (“Jaʻfar the Liar”). For more information, refer to a similar Tablet from Baháʼuʼlláh: [https://adibmasumian.com/translations/existence-of-qaim/](https://adibmasumian.com/translations/existence-of-qaim/) \[Mirrored on site at [http://bahai-library.com/bahaullah\_masumian\_existence_qaim](http://bahai-library.com/bahaullah_masumian_existence_qaim)\]

\[3\] Qurʼán 11:18.
