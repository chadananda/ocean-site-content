I . Some t r a ns lat ion is s ue s
   Early last year, a translation was posted by Dr Juan Cole of
a tablet by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that dealt with the functioning and
authority of the Universal House of Justice: “On the House of
Justice and Bahá’í Jurisprudence.” The translation, which has
now been posted to the H-Bahai web-site, has a number of
places where the translation is infelicitous and appears to be
due to a misapprehension and, in one place, to a mis-reading of
the text.
   In the first part of this presentation, I discuss in detail
those points of translation where I differ from Dr Cole; in the
second part, I present an alternative translation of the whole
tablet; while in the third part, I discuss a number of issues
arising out of these points of translation.
   The first point at which there is an inappropriate
translation is the following sentence:
      It should not be thought that the house of justice will
      make decisions out of self-interest. I take refuge in

*
  In the summer of 2001, Dr Juan Cole posted a translation of a tablet of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá on an e-mail list that he runs, called H-Bahái. I then wrote a
response to this in 2002, pointing out a number of problems with this
translation. This paper is the response that I made, slightly altered to make
is more easily readable. Dr Cole responded on the H-Bahái list to what I
written and I append to this paper an e-mail that I wrote replying to this.
258                      Functioning of the Universal House of Justice

      God! The greatest house of justice makes decisions and
      laws by virtue of the inspiration and confirmation of
      the holy spirit.
The transliteration and word-for-word translation of this is as
follows:
      hamchih muláhizih nashavad kih bayt al-`adl
      Thus it should not be considered that the House of
      Justice
      bih fikr va ra’y-i khísh qarárí dihand.
      by/through its own thought and opinion shall give a
      decree/ruling.
      Istaghfar Alláh!
      I take refuge with God [from such a thought]!
      Bayt al-`adl-i a`zam bi ilhám va ta’yid-i
      The most mighty House of Justice by/through
      inspiration and the confirmation
      rúh al-quds qarár va ahkám járí nimáyad
      of the holy spirit decrees/rulings and laws shall give (or
      execute)
There is nothing in the sentence that could be translated as
“self-interest.” The two sentences are set against one another
and this is made clear by the use of “qarár” in both sentences
and by the exclamation between them. The first sentence states
that the House of Justice will not base it rulings on the
arbitrary opinions of its members and the second sentence goes
on to explain why that should be so — because its ruling will be
inspired and confirmed by the Holy Spirit.
   In the next sentence there is a minor point: this next sentence
is somewhat stronger than is suggested by Cole’s translation.
There are three words which Cole has rendered as just one word
“protection”: vaqáyat va himáyat va siyánat . It is true that they
all have much the same meaning, but to translate them all with
one word does not convey the full force of the original.
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                     259

   The previous point is a fairly minor one compared to the
problem in the next paragraph. The sentence in question is
given by Cole as: “This is the wisdom of giving the house of
justice the purview over personal status ordinances (ahkám-i
madaniyyih).” The word madaniyyih comes from the root m-d-
n meaning to “stay” or “dwell.” The word madína which means
“city” or “town” comes from the same root. It is the exact
cognate in Islamic philosophical writing of the Latin “civis”
and the Greek “polis” (see S. Afnan, Philosophical Lexicon in Persian
and Arabic, 2nd ed., Tehran, 1262/1983, p. 278). Thus the adjective
“madaní” and its feminine form “madaniyyih” can be rendered
“urban,” “civil,” “civilizational,” or “social.” Its meaning is
therefore the exact opposite of Cole’s rendering of “personal
status.” “Madaniyyih” refers not to the personal and private
aspects of human life but to the social and civil.
   In the next paragraph, the main problem appeared to be that
of extraneous material which does not appear in the original
text. There are some 30 words or more for which there is no
basis in the text as published on H-Bahai and Cole has not
indicated that he has used any other text. There is nothing in
the text that corresponds to his passage: “that the
jurisprudential reasoning or adoption of such by the
institution of the house of justice, whose members are elected
and seen as legitimate by the generality of the community, will
not provoke discord.” The text reads: “wa farq hamín ast kih as
istinbát-i `ulama hukman ikhtiláf hásil shavad va ba`ith-i tafríq
…” In other words, the text runs directly on from the sentence
that Cole has translated as: “…unless it is adopted by the house
of justice. The difference is this…” to the passage that he has
translated as: “…the jurisprudential rulings of individual
scholars can provoke disputes and cause division…” There is
nothing in between that could allow for the extensive passage
that Cole has inserted here. I was somewhat surprised by this.
However, I noticed that Cole’s added text breaks off and
resumes at exactly the same word istinbát . This is a good clue
to the fact that the copyist of the text on H-Bahai (taken from
INBA 59, pp. 275-80) has skipped from one occurrence of a
word to another when copying. I therefore looked around for
other texts of the same tablet and eventually found an
alternative text for the bulk of this tablet in ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd
Ishráq-Khávarí, Rahíq Makhtúm, vol. 1, Tehran: Mu’assisih
260                    Functioning of the Universal House of Justice

Millí Matbú`át Amrí, 130 B.E., pp. 370-3. This text does have
the missing passage in it. Since there is good evidence as I have
indicated that this is a passage that the copyist of the INBA
text skipped over, I have therefore inserted this passage into the
translation below in square parentheses.
   In the next paragraph, we again have Cole translating
“madaniyyat ” as “personal status”: “As for the command to
marry, this is entirely a personal status law.” The same
comments as above apply here. However one translates
“madaniyyat ,” it means the exact opposite of the personal and
private. Indeed Cole acknowledges as much when, two and
three sentences later, the phrase “qawá’id-i madaniyyat ” occurs
twice in successive sentences and is both times translated by
Cole as “the principles of civilization.” If “madaniyyat ” here
should be translated as “civilization,” then two sentences
before “madaniyyih” should be translated the same way
(madaniyyat and madaniyyih being two different ways in which
the same Arabic word has been taken over into Persian — the
first as a noun and the second as an adjective): “As for the
command to marry, this is entirely a civil law (or a law of
civilization).”
   Despite acknowledging that “madaniyyat ” in the phrase
“qawá’id-i madaniyyat ” means “civilisation,” three sentences
later, Cole is back to translating “madaní” and, in the next
sentence, “madaniyyih” (madaní is the masculine form of
madaniyyih) as “personal status” (“But this ruling is
implemented in all the Christian denominations, since this
matter is purely one of personal status” and “If you consider,
it will be apparent that this matter — that is, putting personal
status law under the purview of the house of justice — is
remarkably consistent with wisdom”). As before, an adjective
deriving from a root meaning the “polis” or “civis” should be
translated as “civil” or “societal” or “political” but not
“personal status.”
   One can also point to the evidence of the next paragraph for
proof that the intention of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is that the House of
Justice has purview over social laws rather than just laws of
personal status. In this next paragraph, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá turns His
attention to the matter of criminal law and makes the point
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                  261

that, in Islam, the matter of those punishments not specified in
the Qur’án was according to the whim of the ruler. However,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá goes on to make the same point again that He
made earlier with respect to marriage law: “this most great cycle
has been so arranged that its laws can remain appropriate to
and in accord with all ages and eras in a way that past systems
of religious law could not ” and “this holy, divine, law of God is
appropriate to all times and ages.” This is a clear reference to
the point that H e has made in the preceding paragraph, the
ability of the House of Justice to alter its own rulings. Thus,
on a matter that is clearly a social question, the question of
criminal punishments, and not a matter of personal status,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá is again indicating that this is a matter for
reference to the House of Justice. Clearly the punishment for
crimes such as theft and assault, for which there is no
provision in the Kitáb Aqdas, is a social matter and not
“personal status laws.” (I will deal in Part III with Cole’s
contention that this paragraph should be taken to mean that
the Universal House is restricted to rulings on matters of
religious law. I am here dealing only with the translation issue
and am seeking to establish that ahkám-i madaniyyih should be
translated as “social laws” and not as “personal status laws.”)
   There is also the sentence that Cole has translated as: “This
was, for the most part, the pivot of the administration of
justice (siyásat ) in the Muslim community.” Since ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
has immediately before this referred to the “ruler” or “those in
power,” it would seem that a better translation, given this
context would be: “This was what leadership among the people
of Islam mostly revolved around” or “This is what government
of the people of Islam mostly revolved around.”
   Finally a word on a later alteration that Cole has made. In his
first version, he had the words: “Nevertheless, this blessed cycle
is the greatest of divine dispensations, and for this reason, it
encompasses spiritual and physical aspects.” Later he changed
the translation of “jismání” from “physical” to “of the spiritual
body.” Now the dictionary definition of “jism” is “body,”
“substance” or “flesh” and jismání is the adjective deriving
from this. Thus the alteration that Cole has made has the effect
of changing the meaning of the word from referring to the
physical to referring to the spiritual (i.e. its antonym).
262                        Functioning of the Universal House of Justice

   Cole justifies reversing the universally understood meaning
of this word “jismání” by referring to the writings of Shaykh
Ahmad al-Ahsá’í: “That is, jasad I has a connotation of
primarily the physical body made up of physical elements.
Jasad II has some superlunary elements from the intermediary
plane between the physical world and the imaginal world of
Forms. Jasad I will perish entirely, and only parts of Jasad II
will survive. The post-death, post-resurrectionary body would
be made up of the more ethereal Jism I and Jism II.”
   Now there are a number of points to be made in respect to
this alteration which brings in a metaphorical meaning that is
the exact opposite of the plain meaning:
   1. While one cannot deny that Shaykh Ahmad did develop
these arcane theories, this fact alone cannot justify the change
of translation here. There are many Shaykhí ideas and
terminologies that did not transfer over to the Bahá’í
scriptures — the word húrqalyá is an example that readily comes
to mind as an example of Shaykhí terminology that did not
transfer to the Bahá’í writings. Before one could accept Cole’s
translation, one would have to see evidence that this particular
usage was adopted in the Bahá’í scriptures. I can find no such
evidence. Indeed one can find evidence of both Bahá’u’lláh and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá frequently using the word jism in its ordinary
usage meaning the physical body, for example: “Man, however,
though in body (jism) the captive of nature is yet free in his
mind and soul, and hath the mastery over nature.” (Tablet to Dr
Forel, Bahá’í World, vol. 15, Haifa: Bahá’í World Centre, 1976, p. 38).

   2. That the word jismání refers to physical reality rather than
spiritual reality is confirmed by the context within which the
word appears in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s text. The first sentence states
that “As for the rest of the commandments, they are derivatives
of certitude, faith, assurance and mystical insight” — i.e. they
are of a spiritual nature. He then says “bá vujúd-i ín” — which
means “nevertheless” or “despite this” and, as anyone familiar
with Persian will confirm, sets up the next sentence to be in
some degree of contradiction to the first. Thus the next
sentence cannot mean “it encompasses spiritual aspects and
aspects of the spiritual body” since that would be of similar
meaning to the first sentence and would not give the required
degree of contradiction. Only the plain meaning “physical and
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                    263

spiritual aspects (or stages)” — the way that Cole had originally
translated this — would makes sense here. In order to make this
more clear, I give here a word-for-word analysis:
    Va amá ahkám sá’irih, far`-i ˆqán
    And as for the laws remaining, derivatives of certitude
    va imán va itminám va `irfán ast.
    and faith and assurance and mystical insight they are.
    Bá vujúd ín chún dawr-i mubárak
    Nevertheless/despite this because the blessed cycle
    a`zam-i advár-i ilahí ast,
    the greatest of divine cycles is,
    lihadhá jámi` jamí`-yi
    therefore/on account of this, the entirety of all of the
    marátib-i rawhaní va jismání
    stages spiritual and physical
    va dar kamál quvvat va saltanat ast.
    and in perfect power and sovereignty it is.
   3. Furthermore, the phrase which follows immediately on
from this one that Cole wishes to re-translate so that it only
refers to the spiritual is also evidence against his alteration
since it again focusses the attention on the worldly. This
“blessed cycle” is said to be “perfect in its power and
sovereignty (quvvat va saltanat ).” The word saltanat refers to
kingship and thus refers to earthly authority. Even when the
word is being used of God, it is referring to his temporal
authority over the world.
   4. Much more significant than even these points is the fact
that this whole issue has arisen out of a misreading of the text.
Cole states that the reason that he has made this change is an
apparent contradiction:
    For one reason or another I’ve had a little time to
    think, lately, and I continued to ponder the apparent
264                      Functioning of the Universal House of Justice

      contradiction in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s circa 1899 letter on
      jurisprudence … At the beginning of the letter, he
      reassures his correspondent: `First of all, this divine
      cycle is solely spiritual, full of godly compassion, and
      is a matter of conscience. It has no connection at all to
      physical (jasadí), material (mulkí), or worldly (nasutí)
      matters. In the same way, the Christian dispensation
      was purely spiritual.’ Then later he says, `Nevertheless,
      this blessed cycle is the greatest of divine
      dispensations, and for this reason, it encompasses
      spiritual and physical (jismání) aspects and is perfect
      in its power and authority.’ These two statements
      appear to be in contradiction.
    In fact if one studies the text carefully, one finds that the
whole case that Cole has constructed (in his e-mail dated 28
January 2001) is based on his misreading of the text. The whole
of the dichotomy that Cole has set up between jasad and jism
and which he resolves by appeal to Shaykh Ahmad, is based on
an incorrect reading of jismání as jasadí in the first of the two
sentences cited. This sentence should read: “It has no
connection at all to physical (jismání), material (mulki ), or
worldly (nasuti ) matters.” Cole’s transliteration here (jasadí) is
incorrect — the word in the text is jismání. The alternative text
in Ishráq-Khávarí, Rahíq Makhtúm, also reads jismání. Of
course it would be nonsense to translate jismání in Shaykh
Ahmad’s sense of “spiritual” in this first sentence, where its
meaning, as Cole has acknowledged, is clearly physical and
intended in an opposite sense to rawhaní (spiritual) just before
(“this divine cycle is solely spiritual, full of godly compassion,
and is a matter of conscience. It has no connection at all to
physical, material, or worldly matters”). Therefore, unless we
are going to suggest that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has used the same word
(jismání) with two diametrically opposite meanings in the same
sort of context in the same tablet, it is difficult to see how
Cole’s argument can be sustained.
   5. Incidentally, in the first of these two sentences under
consideration, the translation “It has no connection at all to
the physical…” is too strong; the Persian “chandán nadárad ”
would be better translated as: “It is not so much concerned
[with the physical]…” — it is an expression of relative and not
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                 265

absolute negation — thus allowing for some worldly concerns.
In other words, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s intention is not to negate any
connection at all with worldly matters, but to state that
Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation is primarily spiritual and only
secondarily concerned with worldly affairs. Once this
correction is made, then it can be seen that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s later
statement that “this blessed cycle encompasses all spiritual and
physical aspects” — the sentence that has troubled Cole (“These
two statements appear to be in contradiction”) and caused
him to reinterpret jismání — is longer contradictory and no
change of meaning need be postulated.
   6. There is also the interesting phrase: fa saltanatuhá
malakútiyyah      rahmániyyah      wa    ahkámuhá      ilhámiyyah
rawhániyyah (and so its sovereignty is heavenly and divine and
its laws are inspired and spiritual). I may be over-interpreting
here but it seems to me that having just stated that the
Universal House of Justice is under the guidance and
protection of Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is here going on to say
that, as a consequence of this, the authority of the House of
Justice is not based on any worldly mandate (i.e. its mandate is
not from those who elect it or any other worldly source), but
rather a Divine one. The second phrase here states that the laws
and ordinances that the Universal House of Justice enacts,
although they appear to be concerning worldly matters (such as
marriage regulations and criminal punishment), are in reality
spiritual in nature, because they are inspired (ilhám) from a
heavenly source. This then explains why ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is able to
say in the first part of this tablet that “The first [point to be
made] is this that this divine cycle is purely spiritual, divine
and moral.” What ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is saying is that even where the
Universal House of Justice is legislating in areas of civil laws
(ahkám-i madaniyyih) that are necessary for human social life,
these should not be seen as temporal and secular matters that
can be judged in accordance with the standards and values of
the world, but rather they should be seen as issuing from a
divine source and are thus to be regarded as being part of the
sacred and spiritual sphere. They should thus be regarded in the
same way as the laws given by Bahá’u’lláh.
  One can see from all this that this tablet was not generated
by an individual having concerns about “the possible
266                    Functioning of the Universal House of Justice

theocratic implications of the legislative role of the house of
justice.” Rather this was a simple and straightforward question
asking ‘Abdu’l-Bahá the obvious point that: if the
Manifestation of God is all-knowing, what then is the wisdom
behind the fact that Bahá’u’lláh did not reveal many social laws,
but rather referred most social ordinances (ahkám-i
madaniyyyih) to the House of Justice? The questioner
presumably asked whether it would not have been better if these
laws were revealed by an all-knowing Manifestation of God,
rather than being left to a group of fallible human beings to
decide. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá reassures the questioner that, firstly, this
arrangement by Bahá’u’lláh is in accordance with Divine
wisdom in that it allows for the social ordinances of the
religion to alter as human social conditions change over the
centuries rather than being fixed by a once-and-for-all
revelation; and secondly, the House of Justice, is in any case
inspired and under the guidance and protection of Bahá’u’lláh
and therefore any ruling it makes will have this guidance and
protection and will be the result of this inspiration. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá also goes on to demonstrate how this is a much superior
arrangement to what has occurred in previous dispensations.
  A summary of the contents of this tablet:
   In this tablet, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá starts by laying down the
principle that the Bahá’í Faith is similar to Christianity in that
its central concern is with spiritual matters and that all legal
matters (ahkám) are derived from this spiritual core. However,
he goes on to state that, since this dispensation is “the most
mighty of Divine dispensations,” it encompasses both the
spiritual and physical concerns of humanity, and has “perfect
power and authority (quvvat va saltanat ),” therefore provisions
have also been made for social and political matters: some
foundational core matters are determined in the scripture while
subsidiary matters which may vary with time and circumstance
are referred to the House of Justice.
   ‘Abdu’l-Bahá then goes on to lay down the principle that
since the House of Justice will give its rulings based on the
Divine inspiration (ilhám) that it receives and not on the
opinions of its individual members, it is therefore obligatory
upon all to obey it. In other words that it is not permissible to
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                 267

argue that a particular decision of the House of Justice is due
to the biases of one or all of its members and is therefore not
incumbent upon all. It is because of this Divine inspiration
that social and civil ordinances (ahkám madaniyyih) have been
placed under its aegis.
   ‘Abdu’l-Bahá then turns His attention to Islam and states
that because only a little of Islamic law was revealed in the
Qur’án, it became necessary for legal rulings to be derived. As
a consequence the different schools of law arose and there were
disputes between scholars. This in turn led to factions and
schism. Abdu’l-Bahá then states that in the Bahá’í Faith all such
ahkám-i madaniyyih (social or civil ordinances) must be
referred to the Universal House of Justice. Individual legal
opinions have no force unless they are adopted by the Universal
House of Justice.
   ‘Abdu’l-Bahá then moves on to two examples of the point
that he is making. He takes the case of marriage, which He calls
an ahkám-i madaniyyih — a social or civil ordinance. He says
that the main stipulations of this have been laid down in the
revealed law, but the question of marriage of near relatives is
left to the House of Justice. He then goes on to give the
example of Christianity, where, although there was no
scriptural sanction against the marriage of near relatives, the
Christian Councils ruled against it. The second example that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá gives is that of ta`zír — those punishments for
crimes that are not specified in the scripture. He states that in
Islam this became subject to the whim of the ruler — and was
therefore very variable. He states that in this dispensation, the
ta`zír — those punishments for crimes that are not specified in
the Bahá’í scripture should be referred to the House of Justice.
He extols this as a better method of dealing with this issue
since, otherwise, the same situation as in Islam would arise
where the punishments laid down in the Shari`ah are no longer
acceptable in the modern world. The enactment of such social
regulations and ordinances in the Bahá’í dispensation will be
“compatible with all ages and cycles,” He states, because it will
be referred to the House of Justice, and each successive House
of Justice can abrogate the rulings of its predecessors.

   In this part, I present a translation of this tablet. This
translation is more literal than Cole’s, and some may therefore
find it more difficult to read, but I thought a more literal
translation was appropriate. I have kept to the text from
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Majmú`ih-yi Makátib-i ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (Collected
Letters of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá). Copied 1318/1900. Iran National
Bahá’í Archives, Volume 59, pp. 275-280, published on H-Bahai
at: http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/ bahai/abtext.htm, except
where, for reasons that I have indicated in Part I, I have
included a passage of almost 30 words (“from the derivations
and endorsements of the House of Justice … no differences will
arise, whereas”) in square parentheses translated from an
alternative text at Ishraq-Khavari, Rahiq Makhtum, vol. 1, pp.
370-3.
      He is the All-Glorious!
      O you who are clinging fast to the hem of Covenant,
      your letter was read and your detailed questions were
      noted. Although calamities, like deadly poison, have
      affected my limbs, my members and my joints, such
      that my pen is prevented from writing and my tongue
      from speaking, and my tasks are so many that it is not
      possible to describe them, yet nevertheless, out of the
      great love that this servant has for that gentleman, a
      spiritual answer will be given, which will be compatible
      with Divine wisdom, concise and illuminating,
      perfectly explaining the matter. It will be a
      comprehensive explanation concerning this question
      and will contain acceptable and sought-after insights
      such that by this explanation, clarification, analysis,
      allusion, commentary and spiritual interpretation, one
      hundred doors will be opened up by each of its doors.
      Otherwise, were the horizons to become pages, it
      would not be enough to encompass [this theme].
      You have asked about the wisdom of assigning some of
      the important legislation (ahkám) to the House of
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                   269

    Justice. The first [point to be made] is this that this
    divine cycle is purely spiritual (rawhání), divine
    (rahmání) and moral (vujdání). It is not so much
    concerned with the physical (jismání), the worldly
    (mulkí) or with the stages of material existence (shu’ún-i
    násutí). Similarly, the Christian cycle was purely
    spiritual and in the entirety of the Gospels, there is
    nothing except the prohibition of divorce and an
    allusion to the lifting of the [law of the] Sabbath. All of
    the laws (ahkám) are spiritual and the morals divine.
    Just as it is said: “The Son of Man did not come to
    judge the world but to give it life.” [cf. Jn 3:17; 12:47]
    Now this great cycle is also purely spiritual and is the
    giver of eternal life, for the fundamental basis of the
    religion of God is to adorn [people] with good
    character, to improve them with virtuous conduct and
    to regulate their interactions. The intention is this that
    beings who were veiled [from the light] might attain to
    the vision [of His Beauty] and that darksome reality
    might become filled with light.
    As for the other commandments, they are derivatives
    of certitude, faith, assurance and mystical insight.
    Nevertheless, because this blessed cycle is the most
    mighty of divine dispensations, it encompasses all of
    the spiritual and physical aspects [of human life]
    (marátib-i rawhaní va jismání) and is perfect in its
    power and sovereignty (quvvat va saltanat). Therefore
    those universal (all-encompassing) matters which are
    the foundations of the holy law (sharí`at) of God are
    revealed (mansús) [in the scriptures] and all secondary
    (subsidiary) matters (mutafarri`át) are to be referred to
    the House of Justice.
    The wisdom of this is that time does not stand still.
    Change and alteration are among the specific and
    necessary conditions of contingent existence and of
    time and space. Therefore the House of Justice is able
    to act in accordance with the needs of the time
    (exigencies). It should not be thought that the House of
    Justice acts on the basis of its own thoughts and
    opinions. God forbid! The Universal (Most Mighty)
270                      Functioning of the Universal House of Justice

      House of Justice (bayt al-`adl-i a`zam) will make its
      decisions and enact its laws through the inspiration of
      the Holy Spirit (rúh al-quds), for it is under the guard,
      protection, and succour of the Ancient Beauty.
      Whatsoever it decides is obligatory, indisputable,
      necessary, and definitive for all. There is no recourse
      for anyone.
      Say: O people! The Universal House of Justice is
      [sheltered] beneath the wing of your Lord, the
      Merciful, the Compassionate — that is to say, under
      His protection, His defence, His safe-keeping, and His
      guard. For He has ordered the believers and the assured
      ones to obey this goodly and pure group, this holy and
      victorious assemblage. Therefore its sovereignty is
      heavenly and divine and its laws (ahkám, ordinances)
      are inspired and spiritual.
      Thus, this is the intention and the wisdom of referring
      social ordinances (ahkám-i madaniyyih) to the
      Universal House of Justice. In the holy law (sharí`at) of
      Islam (Furqán), also, all of the laws were not revealed
      (mansús) [in the Qur’án]. Indeed, not one thousandth
      were revealed. Although all important matters were
      mentioned, yet one hundred thousand laws were not
      mentioned. Later the `ulama derived (istinbát) them
      according to the rules (qavá’id) of the [science of] the
      Principles [of Jurisprudence] (úsúl). In those early
      [schools] of law (shará’í`), the individual members of
      the `ulama would derive (istinbát) these [laws]
      differently and they were implemented. Now, the
      [process of] deriving [the law] is to be referred to the
      House of Justice and the derivation (istinbát) and
      elicitation (istikhráj) of individual learned persons
      (`ulamá) has no authority, unless the House of Justice
      endorses it. The difference is just this that [from the
      derivations and endorsements of the House of Justice,
      whose members are elected and have the confidence of
      the generality of the community, no differences will
      arise, whereas] from the derivations (istinbát) of the
      members of the learned and wise comes about
      differences and this leads to sectarian splitting,
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                  271

    separation and division. The unity of discourse and
    the oneness of the religion of God would disappear and
    the foundations of the law (sharí`at) of God would be
    shaken.
    As for the command to marry, this is entirely a social
    law (ahkám-i madanniyat). Despite this, its conditions
    are stipulated and its fundamentals are made clear in
    the law (sharí`at) of God. However, the marriage of near
    relatives is not revealed [in the scripture] (ghayr-i
    mansús). It is referred to the House of Justice, who will
    make decisions based on the principles of civilisation
    (qavá’id-i madaniyyat), the exigencies of medicine,
    wisdom, and the tendencies of human nature. There is
    no doubt that (marriage with) distant stock is closer to
    the principles of civilization, medicine, and nature,
    than with closely related peoples. And consider this
    observation: in Christian holy law (sharí`at), although
    marriage to near relatives (aqárib) was in fact
    permitted, in that its prohibition was not revealed [in
    scripture] (mansús), nevertheless, the early Christian
    councils prohibited the marriage of near relatives to
    seven degrees of separation (literally “seven
    generations” — i.e. those who have a common ancestor
    seven generations back). Moreover this is implemented
    in all of the sects of Christianity because this is purely
    a social (madaní) matter. Now anything the House of
    Justice decides in this matter, that is the definitive and
    decisive divine law. No-one may infringe it.
    If you consider it, you will see how much this referral
    of social laws (ahkám-i madaniyyih) to the House of
    Justice is consistent with wisdom. For whenever a
    difficulty arises because a compelling circumstance has
    arisen, at that time, because the House of Justice has
    decided the previous ruling (qarár), a particular House
    of Justice can again, because of specific compelling
    circumstances, issue a new specific ruling for this
    particular case and circumstance, and thus the danger
    may be completely averted. For whatsoever the House
    of Justice has decreed, that it can also abrogate.
272                      Functioning of the Universal House of Justice

      In Islam, there was also the matter of punishments that
      were not decreed in the holy law (ta`zír). These were
      referred to those in authority. Since there was no
      revealed law (nasúsí) about the extent of such
      punishments (ta`zír), it was determined by and
      dependant upon the whim (ra’y) of the person in
      power. And these punishments ranged from verbal
      censure to the death penalty. This is what government
      (siyásat) of the people of Islam mostly revolved around.
      In any case, the foundation of this mighty
      dispensation has been arranged in such a manner that
      its laws will be in accordance with and suitable for
      every age and time, unlike the holy laws (shará’í`) of the
      past, the implementation of which are now suspended
      or impossible. For example, observe that the laws of the
      Torah are in no way capable of being implemented
      today, since there are ten capital offenses in it.
      Similarly, according to the holy law (sharí`at) of Islam
      (Furqán), the hand is to be cut off for stealing ten
      dirhams. Now, is the implementation of such a law
      possible? No! By God! But this holy and divine law is
      compatible with all ages and centuries and the passing
      of time. “Thus have we made you a middle people, that
      you may be a witness unto the people and the
      Messenger may be a witness to you.” (Qur’án 2:137)
      The eloquent poetry and the consummate verses that
      have been composed with delectable contents should be
      recited and sung. Truly they are worthy of being
      chanted in the assemblies of divine unity. Upon you be
      glory. `A[bdu’l-Bahá] `A[bbás]

   Having considered the translation of this important tablet
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and demonstrated that far from limiting the
Universal House of Justice to merely legislating on matters of
“personal status laws,” it in fact gives the House the authority
to enact laws and decisions affecting social or “civilizational”
matters (ahkám madaniyyih), we need now to consider the
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                 273

effect that this has on the rest of Cole’s argument. Cole has
used his translation of this tablet as evidence for his assertion
made frequently elsewhere that the phrase “umúr siyásiyyih” in
the Tablet of Ishráqát does not mean “matters of state” as
Shoghi Effendi has translated it, but in fact means “the
administration of religious law.”
   Cole has argued that, in this tablet, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that
the jurisdiction of the Universal House of Justice extends to
the “ahkám madaniyyih” and, translating this phrase as
“personal status laws,” contends that this supports his
interpretation of the phrase “umúr siyásiyyih” as referring only
to the administration of religious law. Having demonstrated
above that Cole is incorrect in his interpretation of “ahkám
madaniyyih,” this not only cancels out Cole’s argument in
relation to the “umúr siyásiyyih,” it also provides evidence
against Cole’s interpretation and supporting Shoghi Effendi’s
interpretation. If ‘Abdu’l-Bahá regards the functions of the
Universal House of Justice as including “ahkám madaniyyih”
and this phrase should be interpreted as referring to social and
civilisational laws, then this is evidence that “umúr siyásiyyih”
in Ishráqát also refers to social and governmental matters and
not just the administration of religious law, as Cole has
argued.
   Cole has argued that the words siyásat and siyássiyyih when
used by Bahá’u’lláh do not have their modern meanings of
politics and political. He states that these are a later meaning
inappropriately imposed. He maintains that the real meaning
of these words as used by Bahá’u’lláh relates to their medieval
and early modern usage which comprises of two main sets of
meaning: first, “the Greco-Islamic concept of leadership a la
Aristotle”; second, “the Islamic juridical concept of as-siyasah
ash-shar`iyyah (post-scriptural ordinances enacted by the
community’s authorities).” Of these two, Cole favours the
second in this context because he holds that the reference by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to marriage laws (which are considered as part of
mu`ámalát — religious law governing the relations between
believers) and ta`zír (punishments that have not been defined in
the scriptures) in this tablet that we are discussing means that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was using this term in the context of religious
jurisprudence and therefore this second meaning in the correct
274                     Functioning of the Universal House of Justice

one. He then also argues that similarly because, in Ishráqát,
Bahá’u’lláh introduces the term “umúr siyásiyyih” in the
context of the words “ibádát ” which is a technical term in
religious jurisprudence that relates to “acts of worship,”
therefore the term “umúr siyásiyyih” should also be restricted
to the sphere of religious jurisprudence. Thus he claims that
this means that the Houses of Justice should only be permitted
to “administer religious law not specified in scripture” and not
enter into “matters of state” as implied by Shoghi Effendi’s
translation.
  There are a number of comments that can be made about
Cole’s position. Among them are the following:
   1. In this tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that we are considering, we
can see a progressive unfoldment by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá of His
concept of the area that the Bahá’í Faith covers and the division
of this area between the revealed text and the functions of the
House of Justice. At the beginning of this tablet there is a mere
hint when He declares that although the Bahá’í message is
primarily a spiritual one, nevertheless this “greatest of all divine
cycles” encompasses “the entirety of all (jámi` jamí`-yi ) spiritual
and physical (rawhaní va jismání) stages (or aspects or stations,
marátib). He does not make any exceptions here — jámi`-yi
jamí`-yi could be called a doubled emphatic — two words with
the same meaning used to emphasise a point. He then later
spells out that whatever matter arises that is not specifically
revealed in the text should be referred to the Universal House of
Justice. And finally He is quite explicit and completely clear
that what He is referring to as being under the jurisdiction of
the Universal House of Justice are the ahkám-i madaniyyih —
laws and ordinances relating to social, civil or governmental
matters.
   2. As Cole has correctly stated in his commentary on this
tablet, the Qur’án has relatively little law in it. In the matter of
criminal law, only six offences are specified. Thus, again as
Cole correctly points out: “In Islam, the authority to enact
extra-scriptural ‘ordinances’ (ahkám) based on scriptural
principle tended to be invested in the ruler in early centuries.”
However, he then seems to imply that these ordinances are
limited to just “the ethical and spiritual life or personal
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                   275

status.” In fact, the ordinances (ahkám) of rulers in Islam cover
all aspects of social and political life. Thus in this tablet,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá is decrying the situation in the Islamic world
where ordinances and rulings covering social and political
matters are subject to the individual interpretations of the
ruling class. He states that in the Bahá’í Faith all such ahkám-i
madaniyyih (social laws or ordinances) must be referred to the
Universal House of Justice. Thus, according to this tablet, the
ahkám that are referred to the House of Justice are not just
matters relating to personal status or inter-personal
relationships (i.e. the area of mu`ámalát ), but rather all matters
relating to civil and social issues (madaniyyat ) — in other
words the area normally regulated by the state. Thus ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s words in this tablet support Shoghi Effendi’s
translation of umúr-i siyásiyyih as “matters of state.”
   3. In his argument, Cole states that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has defined
what He means by siyásat when He says that “This was, for the
most part, the pivot of the administration of justice (siyasat )
in the Muslim community.” As can be seen from the preceding
translation, I have considered it better, given the context, to
translate this as: “This is what government of the people of
Islam mostly revolved around.” In any case, I do not see this
sentence as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá defining what siyásat is, rather He is
making an observation that much of the time of the rulers in
the Islamic world was taken up with ruling on such matters.
   Even if we do allow Cole’s interpretation of this sentence to
stand, this statement by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá only defines siyásat in
relation to the “people of Islam.” This must be seen in the
context of the following sentence that starts “bárí” which
means “in any event,” “in any case” or “anyhow” — in other
words this following sentence is being set up in opposition to
the previous sentence: “In any case, the foundation of this
mighty dispensation has been arranged in such a manner that
its laws will be in accordance with and suitable for every age
and time…” Thus even if we allow Cole’s limiting siyása to the
administration of the religious law in Islam, the following
sentence is saying that that situation does not hold in this, the
Bahá’í dispensation. It is saying that, in the Bahá’í
dispensation, siyása is different to siyása in Islam. So that
however we define the word siyása for the Islamic world, it
276                    Functioning of the Universal House of Justice

does not necessarily follow that the same definition holds in the
Bahá’í dispensation. The limits of siyása in the Bahá’í
dispensation is mapped out by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá through His use of
the term ahkám-i madaniyya — laws relating to social or civil
matters — a term clearly encompassing all aspects of human
social life. In other words, regardless of what the limits of the
term siyása were in the Islamic dispensation, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is
here extending the limits of siyása in the Bahá’í dispensation to
include all aspects of human social life. This wide meaning of
the term siyása can then be transferred to the Ishráqát. Here
Bahá’u’lláh is saying that matters of worship (`ibádát — prayer,
fasting, etc.) should be performed in accordance with the
Scripture (i.e. the laws of the Aqdas), but umúr-i siyásiyyih
(which we know from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s gloss to be equivalent to
ahkám-i madaniyyih — laws and ordinances pertaining to social
and civil matters) should be referred to the House of Justice.
And we can be sure that Bahá’u’lláh in this passage is intending
the same range of meaning that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá intended in this
tablet because Bahá’u’lláh uses precisely the same argument that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá uses — that this is in order that these social
ordinances should remain in accordance with changing human
requirements.
   Thus Bahá’u’lláh’s usage, umúr -i siyásiyyih, here is perfectly
in alignment with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s term ahkám-i madaniyyih and
refers to those areas of human life that require social
regulation. Now Shoghi Effendi’s translation of Bahá’u’lláh’s
umúr -i siyásiyyih as “affairs of state” seems to me to fit well
within this semantic range. In any civilised society (“civilised”
being here used as meaning an urbanised society), there is need
for communal regulation and therefore human beings have set
up a state structure to regulate their affairs. At the head of this
state structure is either an individual or a body of people
whose function is to enact such communal and social
regulations as may be required in order to allow human social
life to continue in peace and prosperity, in order to allow
civilization to develop and prosper. Thus those areas of human
communal life that require regulation can be described in
English as “affairs of state” and in Persian as umúr-i siyásiyyih;
and for this regulation, they require the enactment of social
ordinances — ahkám-i madaniyyih. Thus Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and Shoghi Effendi’s usages are all consistently within the
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                 277

same range of meaning: that which should be referred to the
House of Justice for their enactment of ordinances are those
areas of human social life that require regulation in order for
human civilization to continue; since it is the function of the
state to regulate such areas of human life, these areas of human
social life can be called “affairs of state.”
   4. It is also of interest to look at the context in which the
phrase “umúr-i siyásiyyih” occurs in the Ishráqát. In the very
next passage, the ninth Ishráq, the following statement is made:
“The purpose of religion as revealed from the heaven of God’s
holy Will is to establish unity and concord amongst the peoples
of the world … The progress of the world, the development of
nations, the tranquillity of peoples, and the peace of all who
dwell on earth are among the principles and ordinances of
God.” Then a couple of sentences later, Bahá’u’lláh lists “the
Trustees of the House of Justice” among the chiefs and rulers
of the world — again this sounds very much as though
Bahá’u’lláh envisages a political and governmental role for the
House of Justice (provided the word “political” is understood
in its sense of social administration and not in the sense of
party politics).
   On can also look at other statements that Bahá’u’lláh makes
about Universal House of Justice. For example, in the Law˙-i
Dunyá which dates to about the same period as the Ishráqát, it
is made incumbent upon the “ministers of the House of Justice
to promote the Lesser Peace so that the people of the earth may
be relieved from the burden of exorbitant expenditures.” This
sounds very much like a governmental role for the House of
Justice.
  5. Of course in considering this matter, it is useful to survey
what exactly the words siyása and siyásiyyih have meant over a
period of time, and specially in Islamic religious literature.
   In the Qur’án, the words siyása and siyásiyyih do not occur.
In the hadith literature, which is some of the earliest post-
Qur’ánic literature that we have, the word siyásat does occur
in a tradition that is widely reported in the early and
authoritative collections of al-Bukhárí, Muslim and Ibn Hanbal
(c. 9th century). In this Tradition the evident meaning of the
word is “looking after.” A woman, the daughter of Abu Bakr, is
278                        Functioning of the Universal House of Justice

speaking about her household duties and her tending of a horse
and at the end of the Tradition, she says:
      (I continued serving in this way) till Abu Bakr sent me a
      servant to look after the horse (siyásat al-faras),
      whereupon I felt as if he had set me free. (Hadith in Sahíh
      Bukhárí — chapter of al-Nikah, hadith number 151 — 107 in some
      editions, 4823 in al-`Alamiyyih CD; also in Sahíh Muslim, Kitáb
      as-Salám and Musnad of Ibn Hanbal, no 25700, 25733).

   This meaning of “looking after” can still be found in books
from a much later period. In Sharh Sahíh Muslim (in
explanation of hadith 3429) by an-Nawawi (13th century AD),
“siyása ” is defined thus: “arising to do for a thing what is
beneficial to it” (al-qiyám `ala ‘sh-shay’ bi-má yuslihu). This
same explanation can also be found in Sharh Sunan Ibn Majah
by al-Sindí (d. 1138; in explanation of hadith 2862).
   However, this function of “looking after” people is so
closely connected with the function of leadership that, in many
passages, it is difficult to tell whether “looking after” or
“leadership over” is the more appropriate translation. Thus in
the Fath al-Barí bi-Sharh Sahíh al-Bukharí by Ibn Hajar al-
`Asqalání (d. 1449), the following occurs: “knowledge (al-`ilm)
here is knowledge of siyása (leadership of / looking after) of the
people according to the Book of God and the Sunna of the
Messenger of God.” (Hadith 3405) In the same work, in discussing
the two words Rabb and Sayyid as names of God, the author
cites al-Khattábi as defining sayáda as “leadership (riyása ) over
anyone who is beneath him and siyása lahu (authority has been
given to him over them?), and looking after their affairs well
(husnu tadbír li amrihi ).” (Hadith 2366)
   In the Tuhfat al-Ahwadhi bi Sharh Jami` at-Tirmidhi by al-
Mubarakfuri (d.1935) also, siyasa is used in contexts where it
could equally well mean “looking after” or “leadership” as
attested by the following quotation (in explanation of hadith
2100): “The tyranny of the Sultan spread over all who are tahta
siyasatihi (beneath his authority/under his care).”
   However, I am sure that Cole would agree that the best was
of determining what siyása and siyásiyyih meant in the
writings of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is to examine further
examples of how They use the word in different places in Their
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                    279

writings. After all, it really does not matter much how other
people at other times used these words. If we can discern from
a close examination of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh and His close
circle, which would include of course ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (especially
His writings from as close to the time of Bahá’u’lláh as
possible), how They used these words, then that would be the
best way of determining what “umúr-i siyásiyyih” means in the
Ishráqát.
   Firstly, this same phrase umúr-i siyássiyih, set within the
same sentence occurs also in the Bishárát (the 13th glad
tidings), but since the context is exactly the same, this
occurrence does not assist us.
   Both in the Bishárát and the Ishráqát, these passage start
with the statement that: umúr-i millat mu`allaq ast bi rijál-i
bayt-i `adl-i iláhí, which is translated in the official translation
as: “The men of God’s House of Justice have been charged with
the affairs of the people. ” Cole has argued that here Bahá’u’lláh
uses millat in its technical Ottoman sense of a religious
community (in line with his contention that siyásí refers to the
administration of religious law). However, even if Cole does
argue along these lines for this particular passage, he cannot
deny other passages where siyásah and siyásí are relative to
`álam (the world) and nás (people) rather than millat . For
example, in the Law˙-i Hikmat (Tablet of Wisdom), which
dates to the same period as the Ishráqát, there is the following
passage, in which I have inserted transliteration into the
official translation:
    Say: The beginning of Wisdom and the origin thereof is
    to acknowledge whatsoever God hath clearly set forth,
    for through its potency the foundation of
    statesmanship (bunyán as-siyásah), which is a shield for
    the preservation of the body of mankind (badan al-
    `álam), hath been firmly established. Ponder a while that
    ye may perceive what My most exalted Pen hath
    proclaimed in this wondrous Tablet. Say, every matter
    related to state affairs (kullu amrin siyásiyyin) which ye
    raise for discussion falls under the shadow of one of
    the words sent down from the heaven of His glorious
    and exalted utterance (TB 151)
280                      Functioning of the Universal House of Justice

Here the foundation of siyásah is stated to be a shield for the
protection of the whole world — not just that of a specific
religious community — the Bahá’í community.
   In another passage in the Law˙-i Maqsúd (which again dates
from the late `Akka period), siyásat occurs several times, once
linked to nufús-i álam (souls of the world) and once to nás
(people) but not to millat . In this passage, it is again clear that
siyásat refers to temporal, governmental affairs, and not to the
administration of religion law, because the ámir (temporal
ruler) is addressed. This word ámir refers to the secular
authority and it would be unusual to find it designating a
religious leader. Perhaps even more significant is the use of the
phrase siyásat-i `álam — indicating that what is being spoken of
is “the government of the whole world” and not that of a
specific religious community. Again I have inserted
transliteration into the official translation:
      God grant that the people of the world (nufús-i `álam)
      may be graciously aided to preserve the light of His
      loving counsels within the globe of wisdom. We cherish
      the hope that everyone (kull) may be adorned with the
      vesture of true wisdom, the basis of the government of
      the world (ass-i asás-i siyásat-i `álam).
      The Great Being saith: The heaven of statesmanship
      (ásmán-i siyásat) is made luminous and resplendent by
      the brightness of the light of these blessed words which
      hath dawned from the dayspring of the Will of God: It
      behoveth every ruler (li-kulli ámirin) to weigh his own
      being every day in the balance of equity and justice and
      then to judge between men and counsel them to do that
      which would direct their steps unto the path of wisdom
      and understanding. This is the cornerstone of
      statesmanship and the essence thereof (ass-i siyásat va
      asl-i án) … The secrets of statesmanship (asrár-i siyásat)
      and that of which the people (nás) are in need lie
      enfolded within these words. (TB 166-67)
   Not surprisingly, the main place to which we should look for
the meaning of siyása and siyásiyyih in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s writings
is in the Risálih-yi Siyásiyyih (Treatise on Leadership or
Politics). This is not only because these words figure in the title
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                   281

and frequently in the text of this work, but also because the
work itself is dated to about the same period of time as the
Ishráqát and thus accurately reflects the usage of Bahá’u’lláh
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at this time. The Ishráqát dates from the late
`Akká period of Bahá’u’lláh’s life, while the Risalih-yi Siyásiyyih
can be dated to about 1892 because of the historical references
in it.
   The following are some passages in which Cole himself has
translated umúr siyásí as “political affairs” — I am here citing
Cole’s own translation (http://www.h-net.org/bahai/trans/
vol2/absiyasi.htm) and merely inserting some transliteration of
the text:
    Toward the end of the dynasty of the Safavid kings
    [1501-1722], may they rest in peace, the religious leaders
    (`ulamá) sought influence over the political affairs
    (umúr-i siyásí) of Iran.
    This was the fruit of the interference in political
    affairs (umúr-i siyásí) of religious leaders and of those
    accomplished in the unassailable revealed law.
    On another occasion, at the beginning of the reign of
    Aqa Mu˙ammad Khan [Qajar, r. 1785-1797], the
    religious leaders of the people once again interjected
    themselves into political affairs (umúr siyásí), and
    thereby covered Iran’s peoples with the dust of
    abasement.
    Praise be to God! Shall persons who are unable to
    manage or train up their own households, who are
    wholly uninformed both with regard to domestic and
    foreign affairs, interfere in the proceedings of the
    kingdom and its subjects, or intervene in the
    intricacies of political matters (umúr siyásí)?
    Were you to refer to history, you would find
    innumerable, and, indeed, infinite numbers of such
    occurrences, the cause of which in every instance was
    the interference of religious leaders (ru’asá-yi dín) in
    political affairs (umúr siyásiyyih).
282                      Functioning of the Universal House of Justice

      Otherwise, what expertise do they have in political
      matters (umúr siyásí), the protection of the subjects,
      the managing of serious affairs, the welfare and
      prosperity of the country, the implementation of the
      civil regulations and secular laws of a realm, or foreign
      affairs and domestic policy?
   If Cole were to object that the Risálih-yi Siyásiyyih dates
from after the Ishráqát (and this would be an unfair objection
since this tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that he is citing as support for
his position is from long after even the Siyásiyyih), then we can
look at the Risálih-yi Madaniyyih (Secret of Divine
Civilization). This book was written in about 1875 and thus
preceded the Ishráqát. Here we find siyásiyyih or siyásí being
used consistently as an adjective to denote “political” or
“governmental” (I have given the Marzieh Gail translation,
Wilmette, IL: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1990, below with added
transliteration and notes as to possible alternative
translations):
   The greatest of the world’s philosophers marveled at the
wisdom of her government, and her political system (qavánín
siyásiyyih-ash) became the model for all the kings of the four
continents then known.” Qavánín siyásiyyih-ash would
perhaps be more accurately rendered as “governmental laws,”
but it is difficult to see how siyásiyyih could mean anything
other than “political,” “state” or “governmental” here.
   Another maintains that only such measures should be
adopted as the Persians themselves devise, that they themselves
should reform their political administration (isláhát lázimih
siyásiyyih) and their educational system and the state of their
culture and that there is no need to borrow improvements from
other nations.” Isláhát lázimih siyásiyyih would be more
literally translated as “the necessary political reforms.”
   The state (`álam-i siyásí) is, moreover, based upon two
potent forces, the legislative and the executive.” `Álam-i siyásí
could be translated “the state” or “the political sphere” or the
“the body politic.” Clearly it is not referring to the religious
sphere.
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                   283

   The world of politics (`álam-i siyásí) is like the world of man;
he is seed at first, and then passes by degrees to the condition
of embryo and foetus … Just as this is a requirement of
creation and is based on the universal Wisdom, the political
world (`álam-i siyásí) in the same way cannot instantaneously
evolve from the nadir of defectiveness to the zenith of rightness
and perfection. Rather, qualified individuals must strive by
day and by night, using all those means which will conduce to
progress, until the government and the people (dawlat va millat )
develop along every line from day to day and even from
moment to moment.
   Another work of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá dates from the same period as
the writing of the Ishráqát. This is the Traveller’s Narrative
(written 1886). So we can expect it to reflect accurately the
same range of meaning that words in the Ishráqát have.
Interestingly the phrase umúr siyásiyyih appears in this text and
E.G. Browne has translated the relevant passage thus: “It is
right to exercise caution and care with regard to political
factions (ahzáb-i siyásí), and to be fearful and apprehensive of
materialist sects; for the subjects occupying the thoughts of the
former are [designs of] interference in political matters (umúr-i
siyásiyyih)…” It can clearly be seen from the context that the
translation “political” is correct here and any translation
related to “ordinances by a post-revelational authority” would
be nonsense.
   In numerous tablets, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statements regarding
the principle of Bahá’ís not meddling in political affairs is
phrased using exactly the same phrase of umúr-i siyásí or umúr-i
siyásiyyih; for example, in the Traveller’s Narrative which as we
have seen is more or less contemporaneous with the Ishráqát,
we find two successive sentences in which umúr siyásiyí is made
the cognate of umúr-i hukúmat (governmental affairs). I give
here E.G. Browne’s translation:
    If so be that His Majesty the King will investigate
    matters in his own noble person, it is believed that it
    will become clear before his presence that this sect have
    no worldly object nor any concern with political
    matters (umúr-i siyásí). The fulcrum of their motion
    and rest and the pivot of their cast and conduct is
284                         Functioning of the Universal House of Justice

      restricted to spiritual things and confined to matters
      of conscience; it has nothing to do with the affairs of
      government (umúr-i hukúmat ) nor any concern with the
      powers of the throne. (Traveller’s Narrative , vol. 2,
      Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1891, p. 156)

Clearly then E.G. Browne, a man who was intimately familiar
with word usages in late 19th century Iran, in translating a
work of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that is almost exactly contemporaneous
with the Ishráqát, thought the correct translation of umúr-i
siyásiyyih was “political matters.”
  In a tablet dating probably to the period of the Young Turk
Revolution:
      … [My] intention is this that you should make the
      officials of the everlasting Ottoman government
      understand to the extent that they ought that the party
      of God (hizb Alláh) does not meddle at all in political
      affairs (umúr-i siyásiyyih). They are forbidden to do his
      according to the irrefutable text [of their scripture].
      And if any person from among this people does meddle
      in political affairs (umúr-i siyasí), the others should
      keep their distance from him that haply he may repent
      … meddling in political affairs (umúr siyásí) ends in
      regret; it is of no benefit or help; it is necessary to keep
      away from all parties (ahzáb). (Makátíb-i ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 8
      vols., vols. 1-3 Cairo, 1910-22, vols. 4-8 Tihran: Mu`assisih Millí
      Mabú`át Amrí, 121-34 B.E./1964-1977, vol. 4, pp. 71-2)

      … Obey those in authority (awliyá-yi umúr) and do not
      meddle in political affairs (umúr-i siyásí) (Makátíb-i
      ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, vol. 3, p. 254)
      … That spiritual assembly must not raise opposition in
      political maters (umúr-i siyásí) which are under the
      jurisdiction of the local government (hukúmat-i
      mahallí). They should not even breathe one word of
      political matters (umúr-i siyásí). (Makátíb-i ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
      vol. 3, p. 507)

  In a letter, which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá probably wrote in about
1902-3 to Mírzá `Alí Akbar Nakhjavání that with regard to
Count Tolstoy, Nakhjavání should write to him and send him
some suitable translated tablets, “but not in such a way that
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                  285

the Russian Government would think that you are in league and
co-operating with him, even in meddling in political affairs
(umúr-i siyásat ), for the afore-mentioned Count is very much
involved in political affairs (umúr-i siyásí). (Ma’idih Asmání, 9
vols., Tehran: Mu’assisih Millí Matbú`át Amrí, 121-29
B.E./1964-1972, vol. 9, p. 40). Of course, no-one would try to
maintain that Tolstoy’s activities could be described as
“ordinances by a post-revelational authority.”
   And concerning an individual who was very much involved
in Persian politics, Mírzá Malkum Khan, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá starts a
tablet written shortly after Mírzá Malkum Khan’s death in
1908: “In this world, a thousand politicians (siyásiyyún) have
come and gone and have spread abroad upon the earth many
important publications (nashriyyát ), but now we do not find
any mention or trace of them. Mírzá Malkam Khan (upon him
be mercy and contentment) brought out political publications
(nashriyyát siyásí) for fifty years … (Ma’idih Asmání, vol. 9, pp.
143-4). Now anyone who knows anything about Persian history
and Malkam Khan will know that his activities were purely
political and had nothing to do with “ordinances by a post-
revelational authority,” thus there can be no reasonable doubt
about the intended sense of the word siyásí here.
   Thus we can find plenty of evidence that Bahá’u’lláh and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá were using these terms to relate to what we could
call “affairs of state” or “governmental affairs.” Cole quite
rightly points out that to translate siyása and siyásiyyih as
referring to “politics” and “political” would probably not
convey the correct intention of the word in the writings of
Bahá’u’lláh. These words are for us at the beginning of the 21th
century inextricably bound up with party politics and the
manoeuvrings of politicians. The words siyása and siyásiyyih
derived however, as we have seen above, from the sense of
looking after others and hence leadership. It thus came to
mean, in the autocratic states of the Middle East, the ruler’s
function of leadership and looking after his subjects and his
state. “Umúr-i siyásiyyih” can thus be translated as
“governmental affairs” or “political affairs” (provided this
latter is understood in its sense of the administration of a
state and not in the sense of party politics) or indeed as Shoghi
Effendi has translated it “affairs of state.”
286                    Functioning of the Universal House of Justice

   6. Cole brings forward, in his discussion of the contents of
this tablet (e-mail of 12 January 2001), an argument from
Abdu’l-Bahá’s Risáliyyih-yi Siyásiyyih (the Treatise on
Leadership or Politics) to support his contention that the
House of Justice should restrict itself to “personal status
regulations and ethics within the Bahá’í community.” He
maintains that in this treatise ‘Abdu’l-Bahá “made it clear that
the civil sphere and the religious sphere would always remain
completely separate; and that religious leaders were not to
intervene in civil government except when they were actively
asked for their views by politicians.” I do not want to get into
the “separation of church and state” argument which has been
rehearsed at length previously in several places. It would be
sufficient for the purpose of this discussion to say that I think
that to try to superimpose American ideas of the separation of
church and state upon ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ideas as put forward in
the Risáliyyih-yi Siyásiyyih is a mistake. In this treatise
‘Abdu’l-Bahá gives an account of several historical occasions in
which religious leaders in Iran have intervened in political
affairs with disastrous consequences. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
conclusion from this is that the clerical class should not
intervene in politics. It would be a misrepresentation of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to map this conclusion of His directly and in an
un-nuanced way onto the situation in the Bahá’í Faith. The
Bahá’í Faith does not have a clerical class. It has no religious
professionals who are trained in religious colleges. Therefore it
does not have that class of people whose participation in
politics ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was decrying in the Risálih-yi Siyásiyyih.
Leadership in the Bahá’í Faith is given to councils of people
elected from among the ordinary believers for limited terms of
office and does not therefore represent the sort of professional
religious leadership to which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is referring. Thus it
is not appropriate to bring that position of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá into
this discussion.
   I would also take issue with the characterisation of this view
of the functioning of the Universal House of Justice as a
“theocratic reading” (e-mail of 12 Jan 2001). This word is
generally used very loosely. Its strict meaning, “rule by God,”
can only be a faith-based theological assertion, which would be
quite unverifiable objectively and which would have no place in
an academic historical or sociological work. However, the
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                  287

word “theocracy” is usually loosely used to refer to rule by a
priesthood or clerical class — a meaning that would be more
accurately rendered by the word “hierocracy” — rule by a
priesthood or sacred class. In any case, as I have stated above,
the Bahá’í Faith does not have a clerical class. Its leadership by
institutions elected from among the ordinary rank-and-file of
the members of the religion with no specialised religious
training cannot be classed as a hierocracy or theocracy.
   Moreover, theocracies/hierocracies have a number of
features that are not shared by the Bahá’í institutions:
1. Hierocratic/theocratic governments tend to be unelected
   and answerable to no-one. Bahá’í institutions are elected
   and hence must seek, at present every year (or every five
   years in the case of the Universal House of Justice), a
   further mandate from their electorate.
2. Hierocratic/theocratic governments tend to give a higher
   rank or status to those who are members of the clerical
   class, and hence members of the ruling class. They, as
   individuals, have rights and privileges over the ordinary
   believers and members of society. Bahá’u’lláh has clearly
   stated in several places, but most specifically in the
   Tablet of Unity (Law˙-i Ittihád) that all of the Bahá’ís are
   to consider themselves as being of one rank. No-one has
   individual leadership. Leadership belongs to the
   institutions of the Bahá’í Faith, acting as institutions
   (i.e. not their individual members). Thus members of the
   Bahá’í institutions should not be regarded as members of
   a ruling class that has any rights or privileges over the
   ordinary believers.
3. Moreover the functioning of these Bahá’í institutions
   does not replicate that typical of theocratic/hierocratic
   institutions. It is true that Bahá’í institutions like
   theocratic/hierocratic ones base their decisions on their
   scriptures. However, the Bahá’í scriptures contain
   mainly general ethical principles rather than detailed laws
   and are thus in practice rarely prescriptive in any given
   situation. In their decision-making, therefore, members
   of Bahá’í institutions are acting on their own sense of
   right and wrong (as guided by general ethical principles)
288                      Functioning of the Universal House of Justice

      rather than applying a prescriptive Holy Law. Thus they
      are functioning more like the members of a modern
      democratic institution than a theocracy/hierocracy.
4. Furthermore, in practice, most theocracies/hierocracies
   are very much wedded to the respective cumulative
   tradition of their religion for a basis on which to make
   rulings and ordinances. In Islam for example, the
   concept of ijma` (which refers to the consensus of what
   Muslims have generally accepted in the past) acts as a
   powerful conservative restraint on the introduction of
   new ideas. Seldom can a new interpretation make its way
   past the deadening effect of this cumulative tradition
   into general acceptance by Muslims. Bahá’í institutions
   are not at all bound by the decisions of previous Bahá’í
   institutions, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá makes clear in this very
   tablet that we are considering.
   Thus on theoretical and sociological grounds, it is incorrect
to characterize the functioning of Bahá’í institutions as
theocratic or hierocratic.

   Following the publication of this paper on H-Bahai, Cole
wrote an e-mail replying to the point that I had made. The
following is an e-mail that I wrote in response. Excerpts from
his prior email are interspersed with my responses.


  In a message dated 25 Aug 2002, Dr Juan Cole writes:
  This issue has nothing to do with Moojan himself, but I would
  like to point out that the full text of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s letter on the
  House of Justice and jurisprudence, as well as the full text of
  the Treatise on Leadership, has never after his death been
  published by any Bahá’í authority and both remain largely
  unknown, except for snippets, in the Iranian Bahá’í community.
  I suspect that these texts by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá have been
  deliberately suppressed by a faction of Iranian Bahá’í
  theocrats, because they are strongly anti-theocratic in tenor
  and represent challenges to that faction’s entrenched ideology.
  Had it not been for my publication and translation activities at
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                        289

   H-Bahai, perhaps even Moojan would not have had access to
   the complete text.
Dr Cole is quite right when he says that he drew my attention to this
tablet, but it is not correct to imply that the Bahá’í institutions were
somehow trying to conceal it. Did I not give references to two places
where the original text of all of the substantive part of the tablet is
published — in Rahiq Makhtum and Amr va Khalq ? Furthermore an
English translation of a substantial part of this has been published
several times, once in Wellsprings of Guidance, Wilmette: Bahá’í
Publishing Trust, 1969, pp. 84-6, once in Bahá’í News no. 426 (Sep.
1966), p. 2, and once in the compilation “The Establishment of the
Universal House of Justice” which was printed by the British Bahá’í
Publishing Trust in 1984 (pp. 11-12) and reprinted in Compilation of
Compilations, 2 vols. [Sydney]: Bahá’í Publications Australia, 1991,
vol. 1, pp. 323-4. This is hardly a case of “never after his death been
published by any Bahá’í authority.” Nor does not this seem to me to
be the actions of “Iranian Bahá’í theocrats” trying to suppress a text
or of Bahá’í institutions frightened by the challenge it represents.
Could the explanation be that no-one else sees any “anti-theocratic”
tenor in the tablet?
   I continue to think that something like “personal status laws”
   best translates what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has in mind by ahkam-i
   madaniyyih. “Social laws” is incorrect because it is too broad.
   For instance, a law about whether young persons must spend
   two years in the armed forces of a state would be a “social law”
   and yet it is *clearly* not the sort of thing about which
   ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is talking here. When he gives examples of the
   ahkam-i madaniyyih, they are things like whether someone can
   marry a first cousin or the hudúd/ limitations on behavior, which
   in Islam treat illicit sex, slander about the latter, theft, wine
   bibbing, armed robbery and apostasy. Marriage, adulter y,
   slander, drinking and apostasy are not broadly speaking
   “social” laws, but rather concern morality and personal status.
   Only theft and armed robbery have wider implications, but in
   early Islamic society concerned civil obligations among
   tribesmen and even in the US these can be the basis of private
   civil suits as well as of state criminal prosecution.
   That is, the concrete examples ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gives in this Tablet
   should take precedence over philological concerns with the
   ultimate origins of the word madani, and almost all of those
   concrete examples pertain to personal status law.
290                       Functioning of the Universal House of Justice

What Dr Cole appears to be saying is that in this tablet ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
gives two examples of what he is talking about: one of these is
marriage law which can be contained within the term “personal-status
laws,” the other relates to the punishment for crimes which is clearly
not “personal-status laws” but we will lump both in under the rubric of
“personal-status laws” anyway. This seems illogical to me, especially
when the actual meaning (i.e. the dictionary definition) of the words
ahkam-i madaniyyih is “social law” which would fit both of these
examples perfectly well.
In fact if one looks carefully at the tablet one will see that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá claims that the Bahá’í Faith encompasses “the entirety of all
( jámi` jamí`-yi) spiritual and physical ( rawhání va jismání) stages (or
aspects or stations, marátib).” And this broad comprehensive sweep
of every spiritual and physical matter is broken down into two areas:
there are those areas that are dealt with in the revealed text and then
everything else which must be referred to the House of Justice. So
Cole is quite right in saying that “social laws” is broad, but then
‘Abdu’l-Bahá is making a broad sweep here.
Incidentally, there is nothing in the text to indicate that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
was intending to limit His definition of ahkám-i madaniyyih by the two
examples He gives. He is giving these examples to show what has
happened in the past because the range of revealed legislation in
previous religions has been too narrow and the followers of these
religions had to interpret for themselves. His intention in giving these
examples is to demonstrate the comprehensiveness of this revelation
because everything that is not covered in the revealed text can be
referred to the Universal House of Justice — even whether “young
persons must spend two years in the armed forces of a state” (if, for
example, this was a matter of an appeal on the grounds of human
rights and the government of the state concerned accepted the
rulings of the House of Justice).
Let’s talk about what the word “ madaniyyih.” meant to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
as that seems the pertinent question to be resolved here. The most
obvious place to look first is the Risálih-yi Madaniyyih ( The Secret of
Divine Civilization). What is this book about? It is certainly not about
“laws of personal status.” It is precisely as the title is translated —
about the causes and impulses that bring about true civilisation.
Risálih-yi Madaniyyih must incidentally have been either given or
approved by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as the title of the book since He refers to
the book by that title in other tablets. From this and the following
quotations it will be clear that “ madaniyyih” meant “civilization” for
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                          291

‘Abdu’l-Bahá. In the book itself, the word madaniyyih and its
derivatives occur numerous times. Just a couple will be cited here as
I do not think that anyone can seriously doubt that throughout this
book ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is speaking about “civilization” and not “personal
status laws” (I have altered the translation to make it more literal):
Did not these new systems and procedures and enterprises of
civilization ( madaniyyih), contribute to the advancement of those
countries? Were the people of Europe harmed by the adoption of
such measures? Or did they rather by these means reach the highest
degree of material development? (Text, 4th ed., Hofheim: Bahá’í-
Ver lag, 1984, p. 17; trans. p. 13)
It has now been clearly and irrefutably shown that the importation
from foreign countries of the principles and procedures of civilization
( usúl va qavánín- i madaniyyat), and the acquisition from them of
sciences and techniques — in brief, of whatsoever will contribute to the
general good — is entirely permissible. (Text pp. 38-9, trans. pp. 31-32)
Thus we have evidence that from long before this 1899 tablet, in The
Secret of Divine Civilization (dated 1875), madaniyyih had a meaning
related to “civilization.” We can also point to a lengthy tablet that is
addressed to the Bahá’ís of both the East and the West and must
therefore date from after the 1899 tablet. This a tablet by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá in which he recaps many of the themes of The Secret of Divine
Civilization. I found it first in Ma’adih Asmani vol. 5, p. 109-10 and
began translating it and then realised that it had already been
translated in Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Haifa:
Bahá’í World Centre, 1978, no. 225, p. 283. So below I have based
the translation on that in Selections but in places have replaced this
translation with a more literal one:
    Two calls to success and prosperity are being raised from
    the heights of the happiness of mankind … The one is the
    call of civilization ( nidá-yi madaniyyat), of the progress of the
    material world ( taraqí-yi `álam-i tabí`at). This pertains to the
    nether world ( jahán-i násút), promotes the pr inciples of
    material progress ( taraqiyát-i jismáníyyih), and is the trainer
    for the physical accomplishments of mankind. It comprises
    the laws, regulations, arts and sciences through which the
    world of humanity has developed … The propagator and
    executive power of this call is just government ( hukúmat-i
    `ádilih).

      The other is the soul-stirring call of God, Whose spiritual
      teachings are safeguards of the everlasting glory … Its
      penetrative power is the Word of God.
      However, until the progress of civilisation ( taraqiyát-i
      madaní), physical accomplishments (kamálát- i jismání) and
      human virtues are reinforced by spiritual perfections,
      luminous qualities and characteristics of mercy, no fruit or
      result shall issue therefrom, nor will the happiness of the
      world of humanity, which is the ultimate aim, be attained.
      For however much happiness may be obtained on the one
      hand from the progress of civilization ( taraqiyát-i
      madaniyyih) and the adornment of this physical world
      ( `álam-i jismání) … on the other hand it also brings dangers,
      severe calamities and violent afflictions.
      Consequently, when you look at the orderly pattern of
      kingdoms, cities and villages, with the attractiveness of their
      adornments, the freshness of their natural resources, the
      refinement of their appliances, the ease of their means of
      travel, the extent of knowledge available about the world of
      nature, the great inventions, the colossal enterprises, the
      noble discoveries and scientific researches, you would
      conclude that civilization ( madaniyyat) is conducive to the
      happiness and the progress of the human world. But if you
      should look to the invention of destructive and infernal
      machines, to the development of forces of demolition and
      the invention of fiery implements, which uproot the tree of
      life, it would become evident and manifest to you that
      civilization ( madaniyyat) is conjoined with barbarism.
      Progress and barbarism go hand in hand, unless material
      civilization ( madaniyyat-i jismániyyih) be confirmed by Divine
      Guidance, by the revelations of the All-Merciful and by godly
      virtues, and be reinforced by spiritual conduct, by the ideals
      of the Kingdom and by the outpourings of the Realm of Might.
      Consider now, that the        most advanced and civilized
      ( mutamaddin) countries of   the world have been turned into
      arsenals of explosives        … (there are several more
      occurrence of the word       madaniyyih but this extract is
      already long enough)
As can be seen from this quotation, madaniyyih is clearly linked here
to the progress of the material world and its promotion is considered
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                        293

to be the function of the government. Humanity is warned however
that unless this physical civilisation goes hand-in-hand with spiritual
values, destruction will be the consequence. Madaniyyat is here
linked to “the invention of destructive and infernal machines, to the
development of forces of demolition and the invention of fiery
implements, which uproot the tree of life.” Clearly nothing here would
induce one to think that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is referring to “laws of personal
status.” (There are also significant references here to jismání which is
contrasted to the spiritual — a subject to which we will return anon.)
In a talk given by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in London in September 1911 (text in
Khatabat, 3 vols. Cairo, 1340 A.H., vol. 1, p. 51 — I was unable to
find a published translation), He speaks about the effects of the
coming of Moses upon the Israelites. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says: “He made
them masters of the sciences and arts and prepared for them a
comprehensive civilisation ( madaniyyih-yi tám). He spread among
them the treasure-houses of the world of humanity” — clearly not a
reference to “personal status laws.”
Similarly, when in a tablet, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is referring to the progress
made by the Arabs under the influence of Muhammad, He wr ites: “All
of them united and in harmony strove for the advancement of
civilization ( taraqiyyát-yi madaniyyih). They escaped from the utmost
abasement and achieved eternal glory. Can any social causation
more powerful than this exist in the world?” ( Makátíb vol. 3, p. 62)
In fact I can find no occurrence of madaniyyih or madaniyyat where
‘Abdu’l-Bahá is imposing on this word the narrow definition that Cole
would like here.
   In this Tablet, in my view ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is speaking entirely
   about the former situation, millet law, which is why I give it as
   personal status law. He is saying that in the Bahá’í faith millet
   law — which applies only to Bahá’ís — der ives from the Bahá’í
   scriptures but is codified, expanded and administered by the
   houses of justice. There was also a move in the Ottoman
   empire to put the administration of millet law and affairs in the
   hands of elected councils from the new middle class instead of
   in those of the clergy, and there were riots about this sort of
   issue among members of the Armenian and Eastern Orthodox
   millets, of which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was well aware. His and
   Bahá’u’lláh’s displacement of clerics or religious jurisprudents
   by elected houses of justice was in accord with the most
   progressive legal ideas of the late Ottoman empire.

Again Cole appears to be intent on narrowing the range of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s terminology when in fact, the text of the tablet gives a broad
range to what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is saying.
If one looks at the tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the world millat occurs
most frequently in association with dawlat — i.e. the government and
the people. Here people does not mean the members of one
particular religious community, but rather all of the people who are
the subjects of that government.
   Among the main linguistic bases of contemporary Bahá’í
   theocratic thought in Persian is a misreading of the word
   “siyasat” to mean “politics” in the modern sense, and shunting
   aside its earlier or more technical meanings, which are the
   ones usually assigned it by Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. I
   have admitted that it can mean leadership in the Aristotelian
   sense, but not in a jurisprudential context. It is true that at some
   point Arabs and Iranians did begin using the word siyasat
   (al-siyasah) as a neologism for “politics.” But in the 1890s when
   ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s contemporaries wanted to talk about politics in the
   European sense, they said “pulitik,” transliterating from French.
But the fact is that Abdu’l-Bahá and Bahá’u’lláh never use the word
“ púlitík.” And when Abdu’l-Bahá wants to speak about what we would
now call politics (e.g. when He is prohibiting interference in political
affairs), He uses the term umúr siyásiyyih.
Actually, Persians and Arabs in the 1890s were already using siyása
in the sense of the government and social administration which is
what the word means when Bahá’u’lláh and Abdu’l-Bahá use it. Thus
for example there is the following from Butrus Bustani’s Muhit
al-Muhit which was published in 1870. This is a very literal translation
of the entry for as-siyása al-madaniyya: (I am grateful to Will
McCants for this reference):
“ as-siyása al-madaniyya is the management [tadbír ] of the way of
living [ ma`ásh] with [ma` ] the public [al-`umúm] according to the
norms [`ala sunan] of justice [ al-`adl] and righteousness [al-istiqáma].
It is one of the divisions of practical wis dom [al-hikma al-`amaliyya] and
is called “ al-hikma as-siyásiyya,” “ `ilm as-siyása,” “ siyásat al-mulk,”
and “ al-hikma al-madaniyya.” The Kitáb as-Siyása which Aristotle
wrote for Alexander contains the important aspects of this science.”
The entry draws on a long history of the word in Muslim political
philosophy, starting with al-Farabi’s as-Siyása al-Madaniyya,
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                        295

translated as “On political government” (see entry on al-Farabi in
Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd ed., EI2). Also see “Hikma” in EI2 on the
division between theoretical and practical wisdom. But the main point
is that these words siyása and madaniyya clear ly had connotations of
more than just leadership — they had connotations of government,
which is exactly how Bahá’u’lláh and Abdu’l-Bahá are using them.
   Moojan has made a basic error of translation here. Words have
   meanings according to their context. In this context, siyasat
   simply cannot mean “government.” The entire phrase is this: “In
   Islam, as well, administrative punishments (ta`zir) were the
   purview of the ruling authority. There were no scriptural texts
   specifying the levels of punishment. It depended on the ruler.
   Such punishments ranged from verbal censure to death. This
   was, for the most part, the pivot of the administration of justice
   (siyasat) in the Muslim community.” The question is, what is the
   referent of the pronoun “this”? We have here a copula. on one
   side is siyasat in the Muslim community. What is it being
   equated to? It is obvious. “The dependence of the level of
   punishment on the will of the ruler.” That isn’t government in
   general. It is the administration of justice in particular.
Actually I think the entry in Bustani’s dictionary is pertinent here. I
gave in my paper examples of the evolution of the term siyasa in
Islamic history and showed that it initially meant mainly looking after
people — or tadbír as Bustani has. This is the meaning that would
make most sense here: “This is what looking after the people of Islam
involved.”
   The apparent contradiction       between    the following     two
   passages —
   [1] “ You asked about the wisdom of putting the house of justice
   in charge of important ordinances. First of all, this divine cycle
   is solely spiritual, full of godly compassion, and is a matter of
   conscience. It has no connection at all to physical, material, or
   worldly matters. In the same way, the Christian dispensation
   was purely spiritual. “
   and
   [2] “Nevertheless, this blessed cycle is the greatest of divine
   dispensations, and for this reason, it encompasses spiritual
   aspects and aspects of the spiritual body, and is perfect in its
   power and authority. Therefore, the universal precepts that
296                       Functioning of the Universal House of Justice

  form the foundation of the religious law are expressly stated in
  the text. “
  — remains the same whether the first “physical” was jasadi or
  jismani. I continue to think that my solution, which is that
  “physical” has two distinct connotations in Shaykhi-Bábí-Bahá’í
  thought, helps resolve the apparent problem. By the way, there
  are passages in which Bahá’u’lláh refers to Shaykh Ahmad’s
  distinctions among the various sorts of body, the physical body
  and the spiritual body.
It would certainly strengthen Cole’s argument if he could cite some
instances of this but I have not found any. The lengthy extract from
Má’adih Asmání vol. 5, p. 109-10 I have cited above also points to a
very physical meaning of jismání — which Abdu’l-Bahá there uses as
a contrast to the spiritual.
What Cole appears to be saying then is that Abdu’l-Bahá uses this
word jismání in two diametrically opposite meanings in the same
tablet — without signalling at all that he is doing this.
Now I am sure that when Shaykh Ahmad uses the word jism to mean
something opposite to what is the usual meaning of this word, he
clearly signals that that is what he is doing. And I am sure that
Abdu’l-Bahá, if He had meant jismání in the opposite to its usual
sense would have clearly signalled this within that sentence.
Otherwise, if the same word can be ascribed meanings which are the
opposite of each other and there is no signalling of this, the result is
cognitive anarchy. Now sometimes poor writers are guilty of this but
Abdu’l-Bahá is an exceptionally clear and good writer and would
never inflict such a thing on His readers.
  I fear this interpretation turns the text on its head. What
  ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is saying is that the houses of justice have *only*
  spiritual authority (saltanatuha malakutiyyah), *not* temporal or
  worldly authority, which is the purview of the civil State.
  Otherwise, the modifier “malakutiyyah” or ‘other-worldly’ would
  not be necessary, and he would just have spoken of their
  ‘sovereignty’ pure and simple. He doesn’t say the *origin* of the
  authority of Bahá’í institutions is spiritual, he says its *nature* is.
I think not. The reason is the connecting word “ fa” which means “and
so.” Therefore what follows is a consequence of what has gone
before. What has gone before are statements that the House of
Justice is under the wing of the protection of God and that its
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                          297

decisions are inspired by the Holy Spirit. What follows then must be a
consequence of these statements. This would only be the case if we
interpret what follows thus: And so its sovereignty is heavenly and
divine (because the House of Justice is under the wing of the
protection of God) and its laws are inspired and spiritual (because the
laws are inspired by the Holy Spirit).
   He uses the same words (ruh, vujdan) here as are invoked at
   the beginning of the Tablet on the Universal House of Justice
   and Jurisprudence, and underlines that “the leaders of religions
   must not intervene in political affairs” whereas it is praiseworthy
   of individual members of religions to become involved in public
   service. The common Bahá’í theocratic dodge, of saying that
   houses of justice/ spiritual assemblies are not “ leaders of
   religion” and may therefore intervene in politics and even take
   over the civil State, is illogical and is put out of bounds by these
   texts of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
This is not a dodge, it is based on what Abdu’l-Bahá Himself says.
He defines in the Risálih Siyásiyyih why He does not think it
advisable for religious leaders to intervene in politics. The following is
from Cole’s own translation:
    These souls [religious leaders] are the authorities in estab-
    lishing the purport of divine laws, not with regard to their
    implementation … what expertise do they have in political
    matters, the protection of the subjects, the managing of
    serious affairs, the welfare and prosperity of the country, the
    implementation of the civil regulations and secular laws of a
    realm, or foreign affairs and domestic policy?
In other words, Abdu’l-Bahá wants them to remove themselves from
the political sphere because their training is in other areas. This
clearly does not apply to the Bahá’í institutions whose members have
no training in religious law but who are elected from among the
generality of people and thus resemble much more democratically
elected local and national governments — people whom Abdu’l-Bahá
obviously does think are suited to the task of government.
