He is God![\[1\]](https://bahai-library.com/bahaullah_lawh_imawlud_ism-azam#fn1)  
  
O concourse of the lovers of God! By the righteousness of the Almighty! This, verily, is a night the like of which hath never been manifested in the world of creation. Truly, this bounty is from God, the All-Powerful, the Beneficent.  
  
     On this night, the Spirit spoke with a voice that threw into commotion the realities of men: "Rejoice, O Concourse on high in the inmost essence of Paradise!" Thereupon, God cried out from behind the Holy Veil of divine bestowals: "This, truly, is a night during which the Reality of the All-Merciful hath been born and the meaning of every eternal decree hath been divulged by the Pen of the All-Glorious." Therefore, rejoice and exult, O people of the Bayán!  
  
     During this night, the Nightingale lifted up Its voice upon the boughs and branches, proclaiming: "Rejoice, O denizens of Paradise!"  
  
     Say: This night the veils of glory concealing the light of certitude were rent in twain and the Dove of Heaven chanted and sang in the midmost heart of Paradise. Therefore, rejoice O Temples of Holiness dwelling in the city of time! On this night, God revealed His light through every exalted Name. Moreover, He hath been established upon every pure and radiant heart. So rejoice, O ye people of the Bayán!  
  
     During this night, the oceans of forgiveness have surged and the breezes of divine bestowals were wafted. Therefore, rejoice with exceeding gladness, O companions of the All-Merciful! On this night, all the sins of mankind have been forgiven. This is a joyous message unto all created things!  
  
     Say: This, verily, is a night during which a pre-ordained measure of bounty and grace hath been decreed in the Scrolls of celestial glory and certitude, so that sorrow may be dispelled from all created things forever more. Therefore, rejoice in thy hearts, O ye who hath entered the realms of being and creation!  
  
     At this, the Herald of the Spirit crieth out in the midmost heart of eternity — the center of transcendent glory and sublimity. This is by the grace of God, the Omnipotent, the Beneficent!  
  
     By God! The Hand of Power, endowed with ascendant sovereignty, hath opened the musk-scented seal. Verily, this bounty is from God, the Exalted, the Beneficent!  
  
     Through the Beauty of the All-Glorious, the hand of the Divine Joseph hath borne round the cup of pomegranate\[2\] wine. Verily, this bounty is from God, the Exalted, the Beneficent!  
  
     Therefore, O peoples of the world, hasten and partake of this Salsabil\[3\] of everlasting life. Verily, this bounty is from God, the Exalted, the Beneficent!  
  
     Say: O concourse of the lovers of God! The unveiled and naked Beauty of the Beloved hath shone forth. Verily, this bounty is from God, the Exalted, the Beneficent!  
  
     O concourse of the loved ones of God! The Beauty of the Best-Beloved hath risen above the Horizon of Holiness. Therefore, bestir yourselves and arise, O people of the Bayán! Verily, this bounty is from God, the Exalted, the Beneficent!  
  
     The Testimony\[4\] and the Proof\[5\] hath appeared, for the Resurrection hath come to pass through God’s Manifestation of His own Self, the Ancient of Days. Verily, this bounty is from God, the Exalted, the Beneficent!  
  
     The ages have persisted, the cycles have repeated, and the Lights have rejoiced, for God hath shed the splendor of His effulgent glory from the branches of every Tree. Verily, this bounty is from God, the Exalted, the Beneficent!  
  
     Bestir yourselves, O chosen ones of God, for the spirits have emerged, the divine winds have been diffused, the likenesses of God have been torn asunder, and the Tongues of Eternity have sung upon the boughs of every Tree. Verily, this bounty is from God, the Exalted, the Beneficent!  
  
     By God! The veils have been rent asunder, the dense coverings have been consumed by fire, the abstruse allusions have been unveiled, and the subtle signs have been unraveled by Him Who is endowed with Power and Omnipotence. Verily, this bounty is from God, the Exalted, the Beneficent!  
  
     Rejoice and silently conceal this secret and hidden Symbol, lest your foes learn of that which ye have quaffed from this wine of rapturous joy. Verily, this bounty is from God, the Exalted, the Beneficent!  
  
     O people of the Bay‡n! I swear by God! The favour of God is fulfilled, His mercy perfected,\[6\] and the light of the divine Countenance hath shone forth with exultation and rapture. Verily, this bounty is from God, the Exalted, the Beneficent!  
  
     Drink ye, O concourse of people and assemblage of God’s loved ones, from this effulgent and radiant Salsabil! Verily, this bounty is from God, the Exalted, the Beneficent!

It is also not known to whom this Tablet was addressed (McCant’s note, expanded by MW). See a [Letter from the Universal House of Justice](https://bahai-library.com/uhj_birth_greatest_name).

\[2\] In the Qur’án, pomegranates are one of the fruits of Paradise (Qur’án 55:68). They are also spoken of in relation to God's divine bestowals upon mankind (Qur’án 6:99, 6:141). (McCant’s note)

\[3\] A river in Paradise (Qur’án 76:18). The Guardian also translates it as "soft-flowing waters" or "soft-flowing stream(s)." Yusef 'Alí notes that the word literally means, "Seek the Way." (McCant’s note)

\[4\] _al-Hujjah_. See, for example, Qur’án 6:83, 149. (McCant’s note)

\[5\] _al-burhán_. See Qur’án 4:174 (McCant’s note).

\[6\] Seems to be an allusion to Qur’án 5:3: "Today I have perfected your religion for you and completed my favour upon you..." (McCant’s note).
