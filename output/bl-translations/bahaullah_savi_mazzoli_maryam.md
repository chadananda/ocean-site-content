Revealed “soon after … (Bahá’u’lláh’s) return from
Sulaymániyyih” (Balyuzi 117),1 this Tablet to Maryam, a few of
whose passages are known to Western readers through their
translation by Shoghi Effendi, the Hand of the Cause of God
Hasan M. Balyuzi (1908-1980), and the British orientalist
Edward G. Browne (1862-1926), is interesting not only as a
source of historical information and of doctrinal and ethical
hints, but also as an example of Bahá’u’lláh’s refined literary
style.

His t or ica l infor ma t ion

The “drop of the story” (π 32) which Bahá’u’lláh narrated in
this Epistle refers to the wrongs He suffered immediately after
the attempt on the life of the Shah, perpetrated on 15 August
1852, by two obscure Bábí youth, Íádiq-i-Tabrízí and
Fat˙u’lláh-i-Qumí, driven mad by the recent martyrdom of
their beloved Master, The Báb (cf. GPB 62). Bahá’u’lláh indirectly
assures His addressee that He had nothing to do with that
attempt, saying that He was first imprisoned and then
banished from His country only for His “love for the Beloved ”
and His “willing submission to the Goal of all desire” (π 2), His
steadfastness “in the time of heavenly trials” (π 3), His
generosity “in the revelations of grace” and His determination
“in restraining the enemies of the King of Oneness” (π 4). And
thus His expulsion was an act of sheer tyranny on the part of
Náßiri’d-Dín Sháh (1835-1896), whom Bahá’u’lláh stigmatizes

324                                  Tablet to Maryam: Commentary

here as the “Tyrant of Persia (Ωálim-i-’ajam)” (π 9).2 Maryam
(1826-1868), the recipient of the Tablet, certainly remembered
in what condition He was during December 1852 when He was
released from His four month imprisonment in the Síyáh-Chál of
Teheran, because she had assisted His consort, Ásíyih Kháum
(1820c.-1886) in nursing Him for a whole month in the house of
her husband, a gesture that won her His enduring gratitude.

Maryam was the daughter of Mírzá Karím Namadsáb and
Malik Nisá’ Khánum, a sister of Mírzá ‘Abbas, better known as
Mírzá Buzurg (d. 1839), Bahá’u’lláh’s father. Thus she was a
cousin of Bahá’u’lláh (cf. “Genealogy” and Malik Khusraví 138-9). She
was also His sister-in-law, both because she had married Mírzá
Ri∂á-Qulí, a half-brother of Bahá’u’lláh, and because her
younger sister Fá†imih Khánum (1828-1904) had become
Bahá’u’lláh’s second wife in 1849 (cf. Mazandarání 5:511), after she
had become the widow of the famous Shaykh Mu˙ammad-Taqí
‘Allámih Núrí (1787-1843-4; cf. Nabíl 111). Fá†imih Khánum is
better known as Mahd-i-’Ulyá, the Most Exalted Cradle, and
the mother of the treacherous Mu˙ammad-`Alí (1852 c.-1937).

Mírzá Ri∂á-Qulí was the son of the third wife of Mírzá
Buzurg, Kulthúm Khánum-i-Núrí, none of whose four surviving
children was a supporter of Bahá’u’lláh. He was a physician,
and therefore he was known as “Óakím.” When Bahá’u’lláh was
released from the Síyáh-Chál, Mírzá Ri∂á-Qulí hosted Him and
His family in his house “close to the entrance of Masjid-i-Sháh”
(ESW 170). He had moved into that house together with his
mother, who had inherited it from her father, when, in the last
years of his life Mírzá Buzurg was obliged to sell his complex of
houses where he lived with his whole family in Tehran to pay the
expenses for the divorce from his latest wife, princess Sháh
Begum, Îíyá’u’s-Sal†anih (cf. Balyuzi 16-7). At the same time
Bahá’u’lláh moved with a number of the family members to a
rented house “near the gate of Shimírán” (ESW 170). In later years
Mírzá Ri∂á-Qulí kept his distance from Bahá’u’lláh, tried to
conceal the fact of their relationship and opposed ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s marriage to his niece Shahr-Banú, 3 “because he was
afraid that Náßiri’d-Dín Sháh and his ministers would frown on
this marriage and take him to task” (Balyuzi 343-4). In the 1870s,
although he was held in high esteem in Tehran (cf. Taherzadeh 3:218)
and had never supported the new Faith, he “was arrested,

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                  325

conducted to the capital and thrown into the Síyáh-Chál, where
he remained for a month” (GPB 198). Bahá’u’lláh maintained
communication with Mírzá Ri∂á-Qulí, exhorted him to
recognize the new Revelation and wrote a beautiful message
seemingly referring to him in His “Law˙-i-Pisar-’Amm (Tablet
to the Cousin),” written around 1870 and addressed to His
faithful cousin Mírzá Óasan-i-Mázindarání.

Maryam, who had been converted by Bahá’u’lláh Himself in
the early days of the Bábí Dispensation, always remained a
staunch believer. She longed to meet her illustrious Cousin, but
her family prevented her from realizing her longing. In her
poems she sings of her love for the Blessed Beauty:

> Were I to drink one or two cups of wine from Bahá’s
> jar, I would continue roaring and blazing even after
> my extinction and death. 4 (Dhuká’í Bay∂á’í 3:334-40)
She tells of the joy of His presence:

> Should I put on the robe of nearness from the hands of
> the Friend, I would illumine the heaven and the earth
> even as the sun. (Dhuká’í Bay∂á’í 3:334-40)
Obliged as she was to stay far from Him, she used her poetry
to give “vent to the gnawing grief she bore for her separation
from Him” (Ishráq-Khávarí, Writings 628). In this vein she wrote:

> The bird of my love was entrapped in the snare of
> separation, and all the birds of the air and beasts of the
> field bewail my story. (Dhuká’í Bay∂á’í 3:334-40)
A whole poem is devoted to describe her sadness:

> O joy for my rare, bewildered and bleeding heart!
> Euphrates and Tigris stream forth from its sea.
> Time was when Majnún’s tale sounded peculiar to me;
> now I have two hundred Laylís and Majnúns in my heart.
> The Ravisher of my heart withdrew His tent from the
> town to the desert; now, even as Qays,5 I turn my face
> to the desert.
> The doleful Zulaykhá6 might have a moon in captivity;
> what I have in bondage is two hundred shining suns.
326                                    Tablet to Maryam: Commentary

> Should I tell what the Wheel of Destiny has allotted to
> my heart, I would burn up the nine heavens to naught.
> For long years I prayerfully sat in the Ka’bih of the
> Beloved; now a journey of more than a hundred years
> divides me from Him.
> O Thou Who dwellest beyond the oceans, see how the
> vessel of my heart is filled with Thee.
> I am so grieved by the pain of remoteness and
> separation that I make saddened the hearts of angels
> and houris.
> The page is finished and the secret of my heart remains
> untold; alas, what a blazing fire I hold burning in my
> hearth! (Dhuká’í Bay∂á’í 3:334-40)
Maryam passed away in Teheran in 1868, at 42 years of age,
and is buried in the precincts of the Shrine of Sháh ‘Abdu’l-
’AΩím, in the outskirts of the capital (cf. Ishráq-Khávarí, Writings
628), where Náßiri’d-Dín Sháh is buried. Bahá’u’lláh revealed
several Tablets addressed to her. In a very poetical letter, that
begins with “O Maryam, The Spirit of life ascended to the
domain of placelessness (maryama, isiy-i-ján bi la makan),” 7 He
consoles her grief at His remoteness: “Shed thee not tears from
thine eyes and be not of the anxious ones. Put on the robe of
submission and quaff from the wine of acquiescence; and sell
the entire world for a mere derham. Give thy heart to God’s
irrevocable decree and submit to that which He has ordained
for thee” (courtesy of Ms. Gloria Shahzadeh). The most celebrated of
these Tablets is “Óurúfát-i-’Állín (The Exalted Letters),” 8 a
Tablet dedicated to the memory of Maryam’s only brother,
Mírzá Mu˙ammad-i-Vazír, “reputed to be the very first among
the family of Bahá’u’lláh to have been converted by Him to the
Bábí Faith in the province of Núr in 1844” (Taherzadeh 1:122).
Bahá’u’lláh also revealed for her a “Zíyárát-Námiy-i-Maryam
(Tablet of Visitation for Maryam),” in which He honored her
with the title “Crimson Leaf (al-Waraqatu’l-˙amrá’)” (cf. Ishráq-
Khávarí, Ganj 205; Taherzadeh 1:13).

As to the title “leaf,” in the days of the Bábí Dispensation the
sister of Mullá Óusayn-i-Bushrú’í (1813-1849), the first disciple
of the Báb, was known as the “Leaf of Paradise (varaqatu’l-

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                        327

firdaws)” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Memorials 177, Tadhkirat 273; cf. Nabíl 383n1).
Bahá’u’lláh bestowed the title “leaf (varaqih)” to the women of
His family. Specifically the title Varaqiy-i-’Ulyá was bestowed
on both His consort, Ásíyyih Khánum, and His daughter
Bahíyyih Khánum (1846-1932). Shoghi Effendi translated
Varaqiy-i-’Ulyá as the “Most Exalted Leaf” (GPB 108) in the case
of Navváb and as the “Greatest Holy Leaf” in the case of
Bahíyyih Khánum (BA 25). “She is a leaf that hath sprung from
this preexistent Root,” Bahá’u’lláh Himself wrote in a Tablet
addressed to His daughter (qtd. in Bahíyyih Khánum 2).
Occasionally He also bestowed this title upon other persons
not related to Him. We have a few examples of Tablets
addressed to women referred to as “O My leaf” by Bahá’u’lláh.
Four such examples are in TB 251, 254 and 256 and in GWB #
LXVIII (132). He Himself explains why He has bestowed this
title on one of those pious women: “We have designated thee ‘a
leaf,’” He writes, “that thou mayest, like unto leaves, be stirred
by the gentle wind of the Will of God — exalted be His glory —
even as the leaves of the trees are stirred by onrushing winds.
Yield thou thanks unto thy Lord by virtue of this brilliant
utterance” (TB 254, Majmú’ih’i 161). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá referred to the
women of His household as “the holy leaves (awráq al-
muqaddasa )” (WT 18, Alvá˙ 19; TB 3:724), “the brilliant Leaves” (TB
2:291, 425, 3:652) and “the Illumined Leaves, the maid-servants of
God in this most great prison” (TB 2:300). He clarified that
“submissiveness is the good quality of the maid-servants of
God, and humility is the character of the God-fearing leaves
who have sprung forth from the Tree of Mercifulness” and
invites a correspondent to strive “to be characterized with
these, that … [she might] be an example for the maid-servants of
the Merciful and a leader of the leaves who are moved by the
winds of the love of God ” (TB 1:77).

After having addressed one of His correspondents as “O leaf
upon the Tree of Life (varaqiy-i-sha˙riy-i-˙áyat ),” Abdu’l-Bahá
explained that “the Tree of Life … is Bahá’u’lláh, and the
daughters of the Kingdom are the leaves upon that blessed Tree”
(SWAB 57, Muntakhabátí 54). He wrote to other correspondents: “I
beg of Him to bestow upon thee a spiritual soul, and the life of
the Kingdom, and to make thee a leaf verdant and flourishing
on the Tree of Life (varaqat-i-rayyánat-i-na∂rat-i-’alá
shajarati’l-˙ayát ), that thou mayest serve the handmaids of the

328                                   Tablet to Maryam: Commentary

Merciful with spirituality and good cheer” (SWAB 164,
Muntakhabátí 161; cf. TB 1:88); and also: “Be rejoiced for God hath
made thee a believing maid-servant in His Holy Threshold and a
leaf of the leaves of the Tree of Life” (TB 1:140). He described
Fá†imih Begum, the widow of Mírzá Mu˙ammad-Óasan (d.
1879), the King of Martyrs, as “a holy leaf of the Tree of God
(varaqiy-i-muqaddasiy-i-iláhí)” (MF 173, Tadhkirat 234) and her
mother, Khurshíd Begum, known as Shams-i-Îu˙á, the
Morning Sun, as “a leaf of Thy green Tree of Heaven (varaqati
shajarati ra˙máníyatika al-kha∂rá’)” (MF 186, Tadhkirat 285). He
called several Western ladies “enlightened leaf” (TB 1:158),
“brilliant leaf” (TB 3:708), “confident leaf” (TB 3:510), “assured
leaf” (TB 1:173, 214), “blessed leaf” (TB 3:625), “spiritual leaf” (TB
1:164, 172), “spiritual leaf who art verdant and well-watered by
the outpouring from the Kingdom of God ” (TB 3:671), “green leaf
of the Tree of Life”;9 “wonderful leaf of the Tree of the Love of
God ” (TB 1:185), “leaf who art moved by the Breeze of God ” (TB
3:685); “pure leaf of the Blessed Tree,” 10 “leaf of the Tree of
Life. ”11 Sometimes He addressed collectively several women as
“leaves”: “O ye leaves of the Paradise of El-Abhá” (TB 1:27); “O ye
verdant and flourishing leaves of the Blessed Tree” (TB 1:28, 29);
“O ye maid-servants of the Merciful! Leaves of the Tree of Life
[to the ladies of the Kenosha assembly]” (TB 1:143); “O ye friends
and daughters of the Kingdom and leaves of the Blessed Tree”
(TB 2:353); “O ye maid-servants of God and leaves of the Tree of
Eternal Life [to the California maid-servants]” (TB 3:661); and
He beseeched “God to strengthen the assured leaves (or women)
… under all grades, aspects and circumstances” (TB 1:228-9). And
thus it seems He used this title for referring both to especially
dedicated believers and to any lady who believed in Bahá’u’lláh.

In a Tablet whose original is in the Bahá’í National Archives
of the United States, Abdu’l-Bahá ascribes the “conditions of
unconscious obedience” to the “leaves”:

> The contingent beings are the branches of the tree of
> life while the Messenger of God is the root of that tree.
> The branches, leaves and fruit are dependent for their
> existence upon the root of the tree of life. This
> condition of unconscious obedience constitutes
> subjective faith. But the discerning faith that consists
> of true knowledge of God and the comprehension of
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                     329

> divine words, of such faith there is very little in any age.
> That is why His Holiness Christ said to His followers,
> “Many are called but few are chosen.” (BWF 364)
As to the adjective “crimson (˙amrá’),” in Bahá’u’lláh’s
Writings it is used in at least three allegorical and symbolic
ways. First, it is associated with the Manifestation of God,
sometimes depicted as the “Crimson Pillar (rukni’l-˙amrá’)”
(Gems 72, π105, “Jawáhir” 82; “Four Valleys” 58, “Chihár” 150; KI 70,
Kitáb-i-Musta†áb 54). Bahá’u’lláh describes Himself as “the
Promised One … seated upon the crimson cloud (ghamámi’l-
˙amrá’) with the hosts of revelation on His right, and the
angels of inspiration on His left ” (“Súriy-i-Vafá” 182, in Majmú’ihí
113); as the “crimson Tree (sidrata’l-˙amrá’)” (“Law˙-i-Siyyid
Mihdíy-i-Dahají” 196, in Majmú’ihí 121) and as the “fruit-laden Tree,
that hath sprung out of the Crimson Hill (ar∂i kathíbi’l-
˙amrá’)” (“Súriy-i-Mulúk” 186, Súratu’l- Mulúk 2).12 He refers to His
Revelation as a “Sinai” enveloped by a “Crimson Light (núra’l-
˙amrá’)” (“Súriy-i-Bayán” 282, in Muntakhabátí 180).13 He also
mentions the “Crimson Ark (as-safínatu’l-˙amrá’)”14 to
describe His Cause; 15 the “crimson Spot (al-buq’atu’l-
mubárakatu’l-˙amrá’)” (KA 57, π 100; Epistle 84) to refer to the
prison-city of ‘Akká;16 the “Crimson Book (ßa˙ífiy-i-˙amrá’)” 17
to allude to the Book of His Covenant; a “fathomless crimson
sea (al-ba˙ri’l-lujjyi’l-˙amrá’)” (Gems 60, π 83; Jawáhir 69) and a
“crimson wine (khamri’l-˙amrá’” (“Súriy-i-Haykal” 13, in Áthár 1:8)
to denote His own words. Second, the word “crimson” implies
tests and sacrifice, as for example in the Hidden Words:

> Write all that We have revealed unto thee with the ink
> of light upon the tablet of thy spirit. Should this not be
> in thy power, then make thine ink of the essence of thy
> heart. If this thou canst not do, then write with that
> crimson ink (al-a˙mari) that hath been shed in My path.
> Sweeter indeed is this to Me than all else, that its light
> may endure for ever.” (HW Arabic # 71)
He also mentions “the crimson land (ar∂i’l-˙amrá’), above the
horizon of tribulation” (“Law˙-i-Fu’ád” 177, in Áthár 1:167) and,
describing the sufferings of the Báb, He writes: “the joy of the
world was changed into sorrow in the crimson land (ar∂i’l-
˙amrá’)” (Gems 22, π 26, Jawáhir 26). Third, “crimson” is referred
also to advanced stages of spiritual development. In this sense

330                                    Tablet to Maryam: Commentary

Bahá’u’lláh describes the “city of knowledge (madínatu’l-’ilm)”
as “a city whose foundations rest upon mountains of crimson-
coloured ruby (jabála’l-yáqúti’l-˙amrat )” (Gems 17, π 20; Jáváhir
20) and mentions “the shore of the crimson seas (ba˙ri’l-
˙amrá’)” as an “ethereal invisible station” attained by “the
dwellers” of “the ark of eternity” (“Tablet of the Holy Mariner” 222,
221, “Law˙-i-Mallá˙u’l-Quds” 4:335).

At the end of the aforementioned Tablet Bahá’u’lláh
mentions three other members of His family. First He refers to
Jináb-i-Bábá (π 39). This title, that means “his eminence, the
father,” was given by the Bábís to Mírzá Zaynu’l-’Ábidín, one
of Bahá’u’lláh’s four paternal uncles. He had been converted to
the Bábí Faith by Bahá’u’lláh Himself in the early days of the
Dispensation. He was very devoted to his Nephew. In December
1848 he accompanied Bahá’u’lláh, when He intended to reach
Fort ˇabarsí, tried to protect Him from the bastinado to
which He was exposed in that circumstance in Ámul, and as a
consequence was so severely beaten that he fainted (cf. Taherzadeh
3:68 and Ruhe 106). He was Bahá’u’lláh’s guest in Baghdad before
He retired to Kurdistan (cf. Balyuzi 112-3). Having seen part of
Bahá’u’lláh’s vicissitudes with his own eyes, He is called to bear
witness to His words. Second He mentions Óusní Khánum (π
39). A Óusníyyih is recorded in the “Genealogy of Bahá’u’lláh”
(204/205) as one of Bahá’u’lláh’s half-sisters and by Balyuzi as
the daughter of Mírzá Buzurg’s second concubine, a Georgian
lady, Nabát Khánum (14), also called Kúchik (Ruhe 23). Finally He
mentions Íughrá Khánum (π 39). She may be the daughter that
Mírzá Buzurg’s second wife, Khadíjih Khánum, the mother of
Bahá’u’lláh, had from a previous marriage from which she had
been widowed. Not much is known of these two half-sisters.

In this Tablet to Maryam, Bahá’u’lláh explains how “after the
fetters of … [His] foes, ” He was “afflicted with the perfidy of …
[His] friends” (π 9). Elsewhere He specifies that His sufferings
came mostly from the machinations of His half-brother Mírzá
Ya˙yá (1831-1912), “surreptitiously duped ” (ESW 168) by a
certain Siyyid Mu˙ammad-i-Ißfahání (d. 1872c.), described by
Shoghi Effendi as “a native of Ißfahán, notorious for his
inordinate ambition, his blind obstinacy and uncontrollable
jealousy” (GPB 112). So great was their disloyalty that at last He
decided to “go into retirement ” (π 10).18 He alludes to those

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                         331

lonely days, spent in the wilderness, when His only companions
were “the birds of the air” and “the beasts of the field ” (π 11) and
refers to His retirement in the mountains of Kurdistan as “the
mightiest testimony and the most perfect and conclusive
evidence” (π 16) of His station. He mentions the circumstances
of His return to Baghdad, which He ascribes to “God’s decree”
(π 19). 19 He remembers the rebirth of the grievously declined Bábí
community after His return as a “new Resurrection” (π 23);
describes the “envy of the foes” (π 24), kindled by His courage in
facing “enemies of all sects and tribe” (π 24); and refers to His
willingness to face “the people of sedition (yá’júj, literally the
people of Gog)”20 (π 32) and their constant oppression. The same
events are also narrated in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán (250-2).

The core of the narration of this epistle is Bahá’u’lláh’s
sufferings that are repeatedly described as the sufferings of
other holy personages of sacred history, comprising previous
Manifestations of God such as the Báb and Abraham. In the
very beginning of His letter He writes: “The wrongs which I
suffer have blotted out the wrongs suffered by My First Name
[the Báb] from the Tablet of creation” (π 1), a sentence that
underlines His oneness with the Báb. Later on He compares His
sufferings to those of Imám Óusayn, of Abraham and again of
the Báb: “This head at one time was raised on a spear-point, at
another was delivered into the hands of Shimr, 21 again I was
cast into fire, and again I was suspended. And this is what the
infidels have wrought against Us” (π 37). In another passage He
describes these holy personages as sharing His grief: “Óusayn
wept for the wrongs I have suffered and the Friend (Abraham)
cast himself into the fire for My grief” (π 7). He writes
moreover: “Were thou to examine carefully the matter, the eyes
of might are weeping behind the Tabernacle of sinlessness
(surádiq-i-’ißmat ) and the people of glory are moaning in the
precincts of loftiness” (π 8). Since the attribute of sinlessness
(‘ißmat ) is typical of the Manifestations of God, this sentence
may describe the Manifestations of God sharing Bahá’u’lláh’s
grief in the spiritual worlds. And thus all these sentences may

be an allusion to the concept of the mystical oneness of the
Manifestations of God.

This theme is recurrent in Bahá’u’lláh’s writings. The
historical figures with whom Bahá’u’lláh identifies Himself are
many. Shoghi Effendi lists “Abraham, Moses, Joseph, John the
Baptist, Jesus, Imám Óusayn, on whom Bahá’u’lláh has
conferred an exceptionally exalted station (and) the Báb” (on
behalf of Shoghi Effendi, qtd. in LG 475). In this vein Bahá’u’lláh
writes in a prayer from Kurdistan:

> At one time Thou didst deliver Me into the hands of
> Nimrod; at another Thou hast allowed Pharaoh’s rod to
> persecute Me … Again I was crucified for having
> unveiled to men’s eyes the hidden gems of Thy glorious
> unity, for having revealed to them the wondrous signs
> of Thy sovereign and everlasting power … In a later age,
> I was suspended, and My breast was made a target to
> the darts of the malicious cruelty of My foes. My limbs
> were riddled with bullets, and My body was torn
> asunder. (“Súriy-i-Damm [Tablet of the Blood],” in Gleanings
> 88-9, XXXIX; cf. Call 96-8)

He also writes: “O Jews! If ye be intent on crucifying once
again Jesus, the Spirit of God, put Me to death, for He hath
once more, in My person, been made manifest unto you” (GWB
100, XLVII); and again: “‘Noah’s flood is but the measure of the
tears I have shed, and Abraham’s fire an ebullition of My soul.
Jacob’s grief is but a reflection of My sorrows, and Job’s
afflictions a fraction of My calamity’” (Ibn-i-Fárid qtd. in
Bahá’u’lláh, Gems 68, π 95).

Imám Óusayn occupies a special position among the
personages with whom Bahá’u’lláh identifies Himself. He writes:

> That which hath befallen Us hath been witnessed before.
> Ours is not the first goblet dashed to the ground in the
> lands of Islám, nor is this the first time that such
> schemers have intrigued against the beloved of the
> Lord. The tribulations We have sustained are like unto
> the trials endured aforetime by Imám Óusayn. (“Súriy-i-
> Mulúk” 204)

and also:

> And again Thou didst decree that I be beheaded by the
> sword of the infidel …. How bitter the humiliations
> heaped upon Me, in a subsequent age, on the plain of
> Karbilá! How lonely did I feel amidst Thy people! To
> what a state of helplessness I was reduced in that land!
> Unsatisfied with such indignities, My persecutors
> decapitated Me, and, carrying aloft My head from land
> to land paraded it before the gaze of the unbelieving
> multitude, and deposited it on the seats of the perverse
> and faithless. (Súriy-i-Damm, “Tablet of the Blood,” 88-9)
Shoghi Effendi explains that “Imám Óusayn has, as attested
by the ˆqán, been endowed with special grace and power among
the Imams, hence the mystical reference to Bahá’u’lláh as the
return of Imám Óusayn, meaning the Revelation in Bahá’u’lláh
of those attributes with which Imám Óusayn had been
specifically endowed” (on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, qtd. in LG 496). He
adds in another letter that this fact “does not make him [Imám
Óusayn] a Prophet,” Bahá’u’lláh simply “identifies His Spirit
with these Holy Souls gone before, that does not, of course,
make Him in anyway their reincarnation. Nor does it mean all
of them were Prophets” (on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, LG 498). One of
the meanings of this mystic oneness between the Blessed Beauty
and Imám Óusayn is explained by Bahá’u’lláh Himself:

> Behold then, O heedless ones, how brightly the fire of
> the love of God blazed aforetime in the heart of Óusayn
> … Say: That same fire now blazeth in Mine own breast,
> and My wish is that this Óusayn may lay down His life
> in like manner, in the hope of attaining unto so august
> and sublime a station, that station wherein the servant
> dieth to himself and liveth in God, the Almighty, the
> Exalted, the Great. (“Súriy-i-Mulúk” 205)
One of the central aspects of Bahá’u’lláh’s Manifestation is His
readiness to give His life for humankind. He writes for instance:

> From the very day Thou didst reveal Thyself unto me, I
> have accepted for myself every manner of tribulation.
> Every moment of my life my head crieth out to Thee
> and saith: “Would, O my Lord, that I could be raised
> on the spear-point in Thy path!” while my blood
> entreateth Thee saying: “Dye the earth with me, O my

> God, for the sake of Thy love and Thy pleasure!” Thou
> knowest that I have, at no time, sought to guard my
> body against any affliction, nay rather I have
> continually anticipated the things Thou didst ordain
> for me in the Tablet of Thy decree. (PM 108-9, LXVI, 7)

A t on em en t

The Christian idea of the sufferings of the Manifestation of
God as an atonement for the salvation of humankind is thus
seemingly confirmed by Bahá’u’lláh: “We, verily, have come for
your sakes, and have borne the misfortunes of the world for
your salvation, ” He writes in His “Law˙-i-Aqdas,” a Tablet
addressed to the Christians (10). The climax of Christ’s
sufferings was His Passion, characterized by the extreme
physical pains caused by the horrible treatment He was exposed
to in those forty hours. Bahá’u’lláh was also exposed to
physical tortures, first when He was bastinadoed at Ámul in
1848 and then in the terrible months between 16 August and the
half of December 1852, the days spent in the Síyáh-Chál under
the weight of the notorious chain “Qará-Guhar” (ESW 77),
weighing about 50 kilos. In later days He was exposed to
imprisonment, isolation and deprivation, but most of all, like
all the Manifestations of God, He had to face the stubbornness
and iniquity of all the people who rejected His healing message,
in the full awareness of the consequences their refusal would
bring upon all humankind in centuries yet to come. All the
horrors of the twentieth century, and others still
unaccomplished, were very clear in His all-knowing and all-
loving eyes. Is there any greater pain conceivable for a loving
Father? However, Bahá’u’lláh is certainly not teaching a new
dolorism, that is, salvation wrought by the sheer suffering of
the Manifestation of God. In this Tablet to Maryam, as in
many others, He describes His pains as an example for
humankind to follow: acceptance of whatever may come from
God’s decree in an attitude of love of God, willing submission
to His decree, resignation, steadfastness, detachment,
fortitude, spirit of sacrifice, becoming nothing, even
physically if required, in His holy Presence. Bahá’u’lláh wants
Maryam, in this case a human prototype, to know about His
grief, to share it with Him, and to moan for Him. And this

concept is perfectly in line with the paramount idea that
salvation also comes through His teachings, “the true remedy
which will heal man from all sickness and will give him the health
of the divine kingdom” (SWAB 152), and through the power of
the spirit of Faith that He inspires in whoever observes His
“commandments, for the love of … [His] beauty” (KA 22, π 4).
T he u n i qu en es s of Hi s Da y a n d His C a us e

Another doctrinal aspect of this Tablet is the uniqueness of
His Day and His Cause, a Cause that “is greater than the
creation of the earth and of the heavens” (π 15), and whose
recognition Bahá’u’lláh identifies with “the Realm of eternal
reunion (bisá†-i-uns, literally carpet of reunion; cf. Kitáb-i-
Musta†áb 197, KI 255)” (π 25), the highest goal of the Sufi path,
achieved only by the greatest spiritual Masters. Therefore,
Maryam is exhorted to “appreciate the value of these days, for
soon … [she will] not see the celestial Youth in the pavilion of
the created world ” and she will “behold the signs of
despondency in every thing, ” and “the people biting their
fingers’ ends in their longing for this Youth, and … how all of
them will search after Him throughout the heavens and the earth
and will not attain unto His presence” (π 31). Words extolling
the greatness of His Day and of His Cause recur frequently in
His writings. For example He writes:

> Had Mu˙ammad, the Apostle of God, attained this
> Day, He would have exclaimed: “I have truly recognized
> Thee, O Thou the Desire of the Divine Messengers!”
> Had Abraham attained it, He too, falling prostrate
> upon the ground, and in the utmost lowliness before
> the Lord thy God, would have cried: “Mine heart is
> filled with peace, O Thou Lord of all that is in heaven
> and on earth! I testify that Thou hast unveiled before
> mine eyes all the glory of Thy power and the full majesty
> of Thy law! I bear witness, moreover, that through Thy
> Revelation the hearts of the faithful are well assured
> and contented.” Had Moses Himself attained it, He,
> likewise, would have raised His voice saying: “All praise
> be to Thee for having lifted upon me the light of Thy
> countenance and enrolled me among them that have
> been privileged to behold Thy face!” (“Súriy-i-Ra’ís” 148-9)

He describes His Day as “the Day of God.” He writes for example:

> Great indeed is this Day! The allusions made to it in all
> the sacred Scriptures as the Day of God attest its
> greatness. The soul of every Prophet of God, of every
> Divine Messenger, hath thirsted for this wondrous
> Day. All the divers kindreds of the earth have, likewise,
> yearned to attain it. (“Súriy-i-Qamíß” 11)
And in the “Súriy-i-Haykal” He explains that “the Day of God is
none other but His own Self, Who hath appeared with the
power of truth. This is the Day that shall not be followed by
night, nor shall it be bounded by any praise, would that ye
might understand!” (29). In Gems of Divine Mysteries He
describes His Day as “the Day of Resurrection, ” when God
“promised all men that they shall attain unto His own presence”:

> Know then that the paradise that appeareth in the day
> of God surpasseth every other paradise and excelleth the
> realities of Heaven. For when God — blessed and glorified
> is He — sealed the station of prophethood in the person
> of Him Who was His Friend, His Chosen One, and His
> Treasure amongst His creatures, as hath been revealed
> from the Kingdom of glory: “but He is the Apostle of
> God and the Seal of the Prophets,” He promised all men
> that they shall attain unto His own presence in the Day
> of Resurrection. In this He meant to emphasize the
> greatness of the Revelation to come, as it hath indeed
> been manifested through the power of truth. And there
> is of a certainty no paradise greater than this, nor
> station higher, should ye reflect upon the verses of the
> Qur’án. Blessed be he who knoweth of a certainty that
> he shall attain unto the presence of God on that day
> when His Beauty shall be made manifest. (42-3, π 58)
Passages such as these pose a challenge to His followers. Do they
imply that this Manifestation is greater than any previous one?
Do they justify an exclusivist interpretation?

In the Kitáb-i-ˆqán Bahá’u’lláh writes that “it hath been
demonstrated and definitely established, through clear
evidences, that by ‘Resurrection’ is meant the rise of the Mani-
festation of God to proclaim His Cause, and by ‘attainment

unto the divine Presence’ is meant attainment unto the
presence of His Beauty in the person of His Manifestation”
(169) and explains that the Day of Resurrection is “the Day of
the rise of God Himself through His all-embracing Revelation”
(142). In the same book He suggests the idea that the term “Seal
of the Prophet,” which the Muslims interpret as the proof of
the finality of Mu˙ammad’s revelation, or any other attribute
ascribed to their Prophet, can be ascribed to any other
Manifestation of God, so that “were they all to proclaim: ‘I am
the Seal of the Prophets,’ they verily utter but the truth, beyond
the faintest shadow of doubt. ” (178)

In the light of these explanations, it seems that the
emphasized greatness of this specific Day of God should be
read in the context of progressive Revelation. In its essential
reality each Day of God is the greatest, it is the day of the
“attainment unto the divine Presence.” In its phenomenal
reality each Day of God is greater than the previous ones,
because humankind has in the meantime advanced in its
unending journey towards its Creator, and thus the Sun of
Truth can reveal a fuller measure “of the potencies which the
providence of the Almighty hath bestowed upon it” (Bahá’u’lláh,
“Law˙-i-Ibráhím” 87). And since the hand of God will never be
chained up (cf. Kitáb-i-ˆqán 136), an increasingly fuller measure of
the potencies of the Sun of Truth will be revealed in future Days
of God. And, although in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s words “centuries,
nay, countless ages, must pass away ere the Day-Star of Truth
shineth again in its mid-summer splendor, or appeareth once
more in the radiance of its vernal glory” (qtd. in World Order 167),
in a remote future day “the Day-Star of Truth” will shine again
“in its mid-summer splendor.”
Progressive Revelation

The concept of progressive revelation is another Bahá’í
doctrine mentioned in this Tablet. This doctrine applies to two
different contexts. On the one hand, it applies to “the chain of
successive Revelations that hath linked the Manifestation of
Adam with that of the Báb” described by Bahá’u’lláh in His
“Law˙-i-Ri∂á (Tablet of Radiant Acquiescence)” (74). On the
other, it applies “even within the ministry of each Prophet ” (The
Universal House of Justice, “Introduction” 5). In line with this

principle Bahá’u’lláh did not disclose His station immediately
after the first Intimation of His mission which He received in
the Síyáh-Chál of Teheran in October 1852. And thus He wrote
to His cousin Maryam: “The celestial mysteries should not be
unraveled and it is not pleasing that the heavenly secrets be
divulged, that is the mysteries of the inner treasures of My
soul, this I mean, and nothing else” (π 13). In this Tablet, as in
other Writings revealed before 21 April 1863, He simply alluded
to this high Station with such words as

> Therefore this evanescent Servant arose for the
> protection and the exaltation of the Cause of God, in
> such wise that one would say that a new Resurrection
> (qiyámat mujaddad an) had come to pass, and the
> greatness of the Cause was manifested in every city,
> and witnessed in every land, so that all the authorities
> showed courtesy and good manners. (π 23)
Only in later years, He openly described His Revelation as “a
new resurrection”: “The heaven of religions is split and the moon
cleft asunder and the peoples of the earth are brought together in
a new resurrection (˙ashri badí’)” (Bahá’u’lláh, TB 247-8, Majmú’ihi
154), He wrote in a Tablet revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. 22

The importance of being aware of spiritual reality

Finally in this Tablet to Maryam Bahá’u’lláh also alludes to
the importance of being aware of spiritual reality.

> Yea, a man of insight (ßá˙ib-i-baßar) is needed to
> behold the Most Great Beauty (manΩar-i-akbar, cf.
> “Tablet of A˙mad” π 2) and whosoever has no inner eye
> (baßar) is deprived of perceiving the grace of his own
> beauty, how much more of the Sacred and Divine
> Beauty. (π 17)
The “inner eye (baßar)” is described by Bahá’u’lláh as both a
prerequisite for and a fruit of the recognition of His station.
He writes in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán that

> when the lamp of search, of earnest striving, of longing
> desire, of passionate devotion, of fervid love, of
> rapture, and ecstasy, is kindled within the seeker’s
> heart … the mystic Herald, bearing the joyful tidings of

> the Spirit, [will] shine forth from the City of God
> resplendent as the morn … [and will] confer such new
> life upon the seeker that he will find himself endowed
> with a new eye (chishm-i-jadíd), a new ear (gush-i-badí’),
> a new heart (qalb), and a new mind (fu’ád tázih). (Kitáb-
> i-Musta†áb 151, Kitáb-i-ˆqán 196)

These words can be easily read in their intellectual, “secular” I
would say, meaning, that is, as describing the condition of any
person who has understood the idea that Bahá’u’lláh is the
Founder of the new World Order. But that may also have a
“mystical” meaning, that is, they may describe a person who
has bent her utmost effort to achieve that communion with the
Soul of the Manifestation, that, in Shoghi Effendi’s words “the
Martyrs seemed to have” achieved “and that “brought them
such ecstasy of joy that life became nothing” (on behalf of Shoghi
Effendi, in UD 406). The importance of achieving this spiritual
awareness is emphasized in the following paragraph of our
Tablet to Maryam:

> Look how the sea is calm and peaceful in its bed in
> majestic dignity and composure. But by reason of the
> gales of the Will of the Eternal Beloved, unnumbered
> forms and shapes become visible on its surface and all
> these billows seem contrary and adverse. And thus all
> people busy themselves with the waves and are shut out
> as by a veil from the might of the Sea of Seas, from
> whose movement the signs of the Unconstrained
> become manifest. (π 28)
And thus His invitation to open our inner eye merges with
the central teaching of His Faith, the theme of unity and
oneness. In this case it is the highest Oneness we as human
beings are able to understand. It is neither the oneness of
humankind, nor the oneness of the Manifestations. It is
nothing less than our inner awareness of the fact that

> The existence of all shadows endures or moves away by
> reason of the existence of the sun. Should the sun
> withhold its grace for but a moment, everything would
> end in the Pavilion of nothingness. O the pity and the
> regret that people should busy themselves with

> perishing appearances and be deprived              of the
> Dayspring of eternal holiness. (π 30)
‘Abdu’l-Bahá has explained the same concept thus: “the
phenomena of the universe find realization through the one
power animating and dominating all things, and all things are
but manifestations of its energy and bounty. The virtue of
being and existence is through no other agency” (PUP 285). Only
this awareness will assist us to understand the deeper meaning
of the paramount “oneness of the world of humanity” (PUP 285).
This is the essential difference between a Bahá’í, who should be
turned towards “the Day Star of unfading glory” (π 30) and the
best modern secular intellectuals, who are interested in
“fleeting shadows” (π 30). In other words, the latter are satisfied
with their intellectual understanding of reality and firmly
believe that this is all they can achieve. The former knows that
her intellectual understanding of the oneness of humankind is
just a stepping stone of a deeper awareness of reality. Any
intellectual understanding, as important as it is as a stepping
stone towards the new world order, is not of great use if it is
not assisted by the power created by the spiritual awareness of
this doctrine, that is, by the power of the “Spirit of Faith (al-
rú˙u’l-ímání) which is of the Kingdom (of God) (al-malakútí)”
and which in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s words,

> consists of the all-comprehending Grace (al-fay∂u’l-
> shámil) and the perfect attainment (al-fawzu’l-kámil,
> literally perfect salvation, fruition, achievement) and
> the power of sanctity (al-quwwatu’l-qudsiyyat) and the
> divine effulgence (al-tajallíyu’l-ra˙mání) from the Sun
> of Truth (shamsu’l-˙aqíqat) on luminous light-seeking
> essences (al-˙aqá’iqu’l-núrániyyatu’l-mustafí∂at) from
> the presence of the divine Unity (al-fardániyyat). And
> by this Spirit is the life (˙ayát) of the spirit of man (al-
> rú˙u’l-insání), when it is fortified thereby, as Christ
> saith: “That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.” (TB
> 1:116; Makátíb 1:129)

Without the assistance of this “Spirit of Faith,” anyone will
remain “shut out as by a veil from the might of the Sea of Seas,
from whose movement the signs of the Unconstrained become
manifest” (π 26). This inner change, this “mystic, all-pervasive …
change, which we associate with the stage of maturity

inevitable in the life of the individual” is “indefinable” (WOB
163-4), and yet it is the practical result of straying “not the
breadth of a hair from the ‘Law,’ for this is indeed the secret of
the ‘Path’ and the fruit of the Tree of ‘Truth’” (SVFV 39), that is,
is the result of service. In ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s words:

> Whensoever ye behold a person whose entire attention
> is directed toward the Cause of God; whose only aim is
> this, to make the Word of God to take effect; who, day
> and night, with pure intent, is rendering service to the
> Cause; from whose behaviour not the slightest trace of
> egotism or private motives is discerned — who, rather,
> wandereth distracted in the wilderness of the love of
> God, and drinketh only from the cup of the knowledge
> of God, and is utterly engrossed in spreading the sweet
> savours of God, and is enamoured of the holy verses of the
> Kingdom of God — know ye for a certainty that this
> individual will be supported and reinforced by heaven;
> that like unto the morning star, he will forever gleam
> brightly out of the skies of eternal grace. (SWAB 71-2)

Et hica l As pe ct s

The ethical aspects of this Tablet are strictly connected with
the spiritual aspect of the importance of the inner eye. The
theomorphic character of Bahá’í ethics may draw us to
understanding spirituality as mere orthopraxis, or a way of
being and living that is consistent with the ethical teachings of
the Faith. One of the reasons why Bahá’u’lláh narrates in this
Tablet to Maryam, as in other Tablets, some of the episodes of
His life may be that He wants His behavior to become an
example for His followers. In this vein He writes:

> My expulsion from My country was for no other
> reason except My love for the Beloved, and my removal
> from My land was for no other motive but My willing
> submission to the Goal of all desire. (π 2)
And with these words He seemingly recommends to accept
whatever may come in the path of His service. He also writes:

> In the summons of God’s decree I was even as a kindled
> and shining lamp and in the time of heavenly trials I
> was as steadfast as a mountain. (π 3)
And with these words He seems to recommend fortitude and
steadfastness, as important virtues in our daily lives, if we
want to comply with His words: “Observe My commandments,
for the love of My beauty” (KA 20, π 4). He writes moreover:

> In the revelations of grace I was even as a raining cloud
> and in restraining the enemies of the King of Oneness
> as a blazing fire. (π 4)
And we may understand from these words that we should be
able to reflect in our daily lives both the divine attributes of
beauty and of majesty. This advice should warn us against the
Italian “Buon-ismo,” that is “an excessive and moralistic
benevolent attitude in social relation … an excessive, and
sometimes mawkish or pathetic sentimentalism” (Battaglia 174),
translated by Gigi Padovani, an Italian journalist of the well-
known newspaper of Turin La Stampa , as “Good-ism”23 and
reminiscent of the “terminal niceness” sometimes ascribed to
the Bahá’ís (cf. Martin). All these statements of ethical
importance are poignantly summarized thus:

> This Youth departed in such a state that My succor
> were the drops of My tears, My confidants the sighs of
> My heart, and My friend My pen, and My companion
> My Beauty, and my army My reliance, and my people
> (hizb) My trust. (π 33)
Whatever may come, a lover of the Blessed Beauty should be
ready to do whatever is required from him so that he may
become fully aware of both “the grace of his own beauty” and
“the Sacred and Divine Beauty” (π 17).
Or t hopr a xis i s n ot T a nt am ou nt t o Spi ri t ua li t y

However, good ethical behavior does not seem to be the only
prerequisite of spirituality. Spirituality or “spiritual progress
(taraqqíy-i-raw˙ání)” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Majmú’ih 378; PUP 142) is “the
acquisition of spiritual virtues and powers” (on behalf of Shoghi
Effendi, qtd. in Bahá’í News 102 [August 1936] 3). One of the “spiritual
virtues and powers” that should be acquired is the capacity “to

perceive the Divine reality of things (˙aqáyiq-i-áshyá, literally:
the essential realities of all things) … by the power of the Holy
Spirit (az nafathát-i-rú˙u’l-qudus, literally: by the issuing forth
of the Holy Spirit)” (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Majmu’ih 138; PT 83, 28.7).
Therefore, although undoubtedly there is no spirituality
without good ethical behavior, spirituality implies an
awareness that goes beyond the best ethical behavior. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá clearly explains this concept: “Although a person of good
deeds is acceptable at the Threshold of the Almighty, yet it is
first ‘to know (dánistan), ’ and then ‘to do (‘amal)’” (TB 3:549). In
His explanations to the leading American Bahá’í teacher and
philanthropist Laura Clifford-Barney (1879-1974) He shed a
greater light on what He means:

> …if to the knowledge of God (‘irfán-i-iláhí) is joined the
> love of God, and attraction, ecstasy and goodwill, a
> righteous action is then perfect and complete.
> Otherwise, though a good action is praiseworthy, yet if
> it is not sustained by the knowledge of God, the love of
> God, and a sincere intention, it is imperfect . (SAQ 302,
> Mufáva∂át 211).

On the same issue He wrote:

> If thou wishest the divine knowledge (‘irfán-i-iláhí) and
> recognition (shinásá’í), purify thy heart from all beside
> God, be wholly attracted to the ideal, beloved One;
> search for and choose Him and apply thyself to
> rational and authoritative arguments. For arguments
> are a guide to the path and by this the heart will be
> turned unto the Sun of Truth. And when the heart is
> turned unto the Sun, then the eye will be opened and
> will recognize the Sun through the Sun itself. Then man
> will be in no need of arguments (or proofs), for the Sun
> is altogether independent, and absolute independence
> is in need of nothing, and proofs are one of the things
> of which absolute independence has no need. Be not like
> Thomas; be thou like Peter. I hope you will be healed
> physically, mentally and spiritually. (TB 1:168, Makatíb 8:119)
In this vein Bahá’u’lláh writes to Maryam:

> Be a companion of the Self of the Merciful (nafs-i-
> ra˙mán) and from the association with and
> resemblance to Satan enter beneath the shelter of the
> sanctity of the Bountiful, that perchance the hand of
> Divine grace may draw thee away from the paths of
> passion unto the heavens of everlasting might and
> glory. (π 29)
It is the path of the Four Valleys, a path that goes layer after
layer from the outer expression of the individual to her inner
core, her consciousness. First, from the outer layer of the self it
goes to the inner core of “the pleasing soul” (50). Second, from
the outer layer of a “feeble brain” it moves towards the core of
a “ready … heart ” (52, 54). Third, from the outer layer of the
“loving seeker” (54) it descends to the core of a “mote of
knowledge” released from “desire and the lowly clay” (57). And
finally, from the outer layer of a “wayfarer” in “the snow-white
path” (58) it advances towards the core of “full awareness, of
utter self-effacement ” (60). Only in this condition the “waves”
will stop shutting the seeker “out as by a veil from the might of
the Sea of Seas” (π 28) and the seeker will enter “the heavens of
everlasting might and glory” (π 29).

Lit e r a r y as pe ct s

Bahá’u’lláh wrote in the “Súriy-i-Haykal” that He has revealed
His writings “in nine different modes” (π 51, in Summons 27) and
the prominent Persian Bahá’í scholar, Fá∂il-i-Mázindarání
(1880c.-1957), has tried to identify them (cf. Taherzadeh, Revelation
1:42). If we adopt his classification, our Tablet to Maryam may
fall within the category of “Tablets exhorting men to
education, goodly character and divine virtues” (Taherzadeh,
Revelation 1:42). Specifically it can be considered as an example of
the letters, murásilát , written by Bahá’u’lláh to the believers
who were far from Him, such as the Tablet addressed to “May
handmaiden and My Leaf” and published in its English
translation in Tablets 251-3.

The style chosen by Bahá’u’lláh for this warm missive to His
beloved cousin, certainly worrying for Him and for His
difficulties, is saj.’ The rhymed and rhythmic prose known as
saj’ has pre-Islamic origins. It was used by the ancient Arabic

káhin, soothsayers and sorcerers. Mu˙ammad ennobled it into
the inimitable style of the Qur’án. The Italian orientalist
Alessandro Bausani (1921-1988) remarks that “the same
inimitability of the Qur’ánic prose, sacred and
unapproachable by definition, prevented this device from
being generalized as the normal prose in the early days of
Arabic literature” (in Pagliaro and Bausani 505). The saj’ flourished
only after the fourth century AH (tenth century AD). The main
characters of Persian saj,’ much loved by the greatest Persian
prose-writers, are: rhyme, comprising the use of homomorphic
words; rhythm, in the absence of any strict observance of the
consistent rhythmic patterns typical of poetry; a clever
utilization of the rhyming and rhythmic possibilities of the
Persian nominal and verbal forms; a skillful suppression of the
auxiliary verbs, which given their position at the end of the
sentences may create according to Bausani “cloying
repetitions” (in Pagliaro e Bausani 506); the use of double lines of
parallel words, known as hashv or redundancy; the use of
Arabic and/or scholarly words, locutions or even whole
sentences; the use of quotations from the Qur’án, the
Traditions, the Arabic and Persian poets; and the intention of
“‘borrowing some elegance from every man of letters’” (Browne,
Literary History 88). The use of rhyme and rhythm typical of
poetry and the simplicity of Persian syntax, that prefers
paratactic constructions, contribute to create an exquisite
and refined prose that has the same effects as poetry itself.
Besides, the lack of the prosodic rules of poetry enables saj’
writers to reproduce the same trenchant effects of poetry while
benefiting from the flexibility of prose. The Persian literature
is rich in wonderful examples of this literary form. However, in
later centuries saj’ has sometimes degenerated into “a certain
monotony of topic, style, and treatment” as well as a “flabby,
inflated, bombastic style” (Brown, Literary History 2:88, 89).

Bahá’u’lláh’s Persian prose has been universally considered of
the highest level and greatest elegance. His style, specifically
that of the Kitáb-i-ˆqán, has been eulogized by Shoghi Effendi
as “at once original, chaste and vigorous, and remarkably
lucid, both cogent in argument and matchless in its irresistible
eloquence” (GPB 138). Browne stressed its “simplicity and
directness” and “concise and strong” style and compared it to
that of “the Chahár Maqala , composed some seven centuries

earlier…” (Literary History 2:89). Balyuzi qualified the Hidden
Words’ prose as “lucid, captivating” (159) and that of the Seven
Valleys as “matchless in its beauty, simplicity and profundity”
(161). Bausani (1921-1988) mentioned Bahá’u’lláh’s “extremely
beautiful traditional style,” described it as “a Sa’dian style,
both simple and elegant” and complained that it has
“unfortunately” been “abandoned in favor of the more realistic
and spoken, albeit sometimes also more complicated, tone of
the contemporary prose” (in Pagliaro and Bausani 538).

The first formal element immediately perceived by any reader
of this Tablet to Maryam is its poetical musicality. This element
characterizes almost all Bahá’u’lláh’s writings of the Baghdadi
period and is a fundamental aspect, although in different
modes, of His Tablets of later years. The musicality and the
rhythmic assonance of the short successive sentences are
reminiscent of the best examples of Persian rhymed or ornate
prose, nathr-i-árástih, typical of the compositions of such
ancient authors as the Sufi ‘Abdu’lláh Anßárí (1006-1088), who
composed beautiful Munájját , Prayers, as Nidhámí-i-’Arú∂í
(the Prosodist) of Samarqand (d. 1174), the author of Chahár
Maqála (Four Discourses) to which Browne compared the prose
of the Kitáb-i-ˆqán (cf. Literary History 2:336) and as the Persian
poet and prose writer Sa’dí (1184-1291), the author of the
celebrated Gulistán and Bústán. They are also very close to the
Munsha’át , prose compositions, of the more recent Mírzá Abú’l-
Qásim, Qá’im Maqám (vicegerent) of Faráhán (1779-1835),
whose “Sa’dian style” is characterized according to Bausani by

> a great attention to the harmony of the periods; the use
> of short sentences; a great skill in placing the various
> components of a renewed sentence in a non-
> monotonous and varied correspondence; the abolition
> of excessive titles, complimentary remarks and litanies;
> a smaller number of continuous quotations of Arabic
> and Persian verses in the prosaic text; the elimination
> of undue metaphors and similitudes of bad taste;
> concision (in Pagliaro e Bausani 535).
These merits may also be ascribed to this Tablet to Maryam,
that is moreover characterized by short sentences; the couplets
of musically parallel sentences; the elimination, whenever it is

possible, of redundant auxiliary verbs; the use of scholarly
words of great poetical and musical impact; the specific
combination of scholarly words rich in mystical meanings and
metaphorical and symbolic images, used to enhance the
semantic effect of the words; and other formal constructions.
All these features contribute to create a poetical structure
characterized by an unceasing and pressing rhythmical cadence
resulting from the exact and perfect disposition of each single
word. The ensuing rhythmic harmony runs across the whole
Tablet and enables each word to express the highest possible
level of communication and incisiveness.

Some of the formal aspects of the Tablet will now be
illustrated through an analysis of the first four sentences.
1. ay maryam! maΩlúmiyyat-am maΩlúmiyyat-i-ism-i-

avval-am rá az law˙-i-imkán ma˙v nimúdih
2. va az sa˙áb-i-qa∂á am†ár-i-balá fí kulli ˙ayn bar ín

jamál-i-mubín bárídih. (π 1)
This first two sentences of the Tablet offer an example of jinás,
rhythmic assonance, in the repetition of the word ma Ωlúmiyyat
(wrongs), in the use of the two homomorphic words, law˙
(Tabled) and ma˙v (blotted out), and of the two rhyming
locutions sa˙áb-i-qa∂á (clouds of God’s decree) and am†ár-i-
balá (showers of affliction), that also are an example of tashbí˙,
poetical similitude. They also comprise two composed verbs
nimúdih (translated as “blotted out” together with ma˙v) and
bárídih (rained) that, beside rhyming with one another, are also
deprived of their auxiliary verbs.
3. ikhráj az va†an-am sababí juz ˙ubb-i-ma˙búb na-

búdih
4. va dúrí az dyár-am illatí juz ri∂áy-i-maqßúd. (π 2)
Sentences three and four are related to one another by the
subtle thread of their rhythmic assonance and the redundant
ornamental preciosities. They are rhymed through the rhyming
and homophonic words, va†an-am (My country) and dyár-am
(My land), sababí (reason) and illatí (motive), and locutions,
˙ubb-i-ma˙búb (love for the beloved) and ri∂áy-i-maqßúd
(willing submission to the Goal of all desire). The formal

symmetry of the two sentences enhances the efficacy of the
expressed concepts, which seems to be the final intention of the
Writer.

Other aspects of Arabic and Persian rhetoric, seemingly used
by Bahá’u’lláh as a stylistic instrument at the service of His
revealed Word, are such literary devices as i∂áfiy-i-isti’árí,
metaphorical genitive; isti’árih, metaphor; trope, tamthíl,
similitude, allegory, comprising the use of words describing
lofty aspects of nature; talmí˙, allusion, comprising
quotations from the Qur’án, the Traditions and poems; the use
of mutirádifát , synonymy. He Himself explained that He used
all these devices “out of deference to the wont of men and after
the manner of the friends” (SVFV 26), so that His addressees may
better understand His meanings.

As to i∂áfiy-i-isti’árí, metaphorical genitive, its use in
Bahá’u’lláh’s writings has been extensively commented upon by
Bausani and Christopher Buck, an expert on Islamic and
religious studies. 24 In his explanation of the locution varqá’u’l-
’irfán (the nightingale of knowledge), Bausani observes that
Western readers could be misled by the genitive used in its
translation. He explains that “the preposition ‘of,’ which
translates the Persian relational particle -i , is to be divested of
the strictly and heavily possessive meaning typical of our
languages” (Saggi 149). Therefore “the nightingale of knowledge”
does not mean a nightingale whose owner knowledge is, ‘just as
the house of the father is owned by the father,’ but it means a
nightingale which is knowledge, i.e., a nightingale which
“emblematically represents on the physical level what knowledge
is on the metaphysical level” (Saggi 151-2). If we take the locution
law˙-i-imkán (Tablet of Creation) (π 1) as an example of
metaphorical genitive in this Tablet, it may be interpreted as a
Tablet which is, or stands for, the creation. Buck points out
that the metaphorical genitive used by Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-
i-ˆqán is “an important exegetical device.” Bahá’u’lláh, he
writes, “interprets a verse in a certain way, explicating a
symbol by suggesting its referent. He then uses both symbol
and referent together, bound grammatically by the Persian
metaphorical genitive, to reinforce his exegesis.” According to
Buck, while Bahá’u’lláh repeatedly uses the metaphorical
genitive, He accustoms His readers to relate the symbol and the

referent. Therefore “far from being merely ornate, his style
renders the actual task of interpretation easier, as Bahá’u’lláh
acclimates the reader to a metaphorical view of reality” (161).

As to isti’árih, metaphor, trope, Bahá’u’lláh uses the
beautiful metaphor to “take the celestial pearls out of the shell
of silence (la`Alíy-i-ra˙mání rá az ßadaf-i-ßamt bírún avarad )” (π
20). He also writes:

> What does the shadow understand of the One Who
> casteth it? And what does a handful of clay
> comprehend of a subtle heart? (Ωill az muΩil chih idrák
> namáyad? va mushtí gill az la†ífiy-i-dil chih fahm
> kunad?) (π 18)
And again:

> All the seas of the world and the rivers gushing
> therefrom flow forth from the eyes of this Youth,
> which have taken the semblance of a cloud and weep for
> their oppression (jamí’-i-miyáh-i-’álam va anhári-i-
> járíyiy-i-án az chashm-i-ghulám ast kih bi-hi’at-i-
> ghamám Ωáhir shudih va bar maΩlúmíyyat-i-khud
> girístih). (π 35)
> Among the metaphors may be listed also the words and
locutions He uses to describe Himself. These words and
locutions depict Him as the perfect Image of God, such as
nafs-i-ra˙mán, “Self of the Merciful” (π 29); as the embodiment
of the divine majesty, such as sul†án-i-dín, “King of faith” (π
26); as the Source of the Divine light, such as shams-i-’izz-i-
baqíyyih, “Day Star of unfading glory” (cf. GWB 83:4, 124:3) (π 30),
ma†la’-i-quds-i-báqí, “Dayspring of eternal holiness” (π 30),
nayir-i-áfáq, “Day-Star of the world ” (cf. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, SWAB 112)
(π 22); as the Bearer of God’s message, such as qalam-i-qidam,
“the Pen of the Ancient of Days” (cf. GWB 60:3) (π 25); as the
embodiment of God’s Beauty, jamál-i-mubín, “veilless Beauty”
(cf. Persian Hidden Word # 9) (π 1), manΩar-i-akbar, “Most Great
Beauty” (cf. “Tablet of Ahmad,” in BP 210, literally the most great
countenance) (π 17), jamál-i-quds-i-ma’naví, “the Sacred and
Divine Beauty” (π 17), jamál-i-qidam, “Ancient Beauty” (π 38); as
the “Object of the adoration of all mankind ” (Bahá’u’lláh, PM 48),
such as ghulám, “Youth” (π 31, 33, 35), ghulám-i-kan’ání,

“Canaanite Youth, ” also an allusion to His mystical oneness
with the beauteous Joseph) (π 19), ghulám-i-raw˙ání, “celestial
Youth” (π 31), and also dúst , “the Friend ” (π 36), Who loves each
human being for her “own sake” (“Súriy-i-Haykal 199); and finally
as the embodiment of perfect servitude to God and utter self-
effacement, such as ‘abd , “Servant” (π 24, 32), bandiy-i-fání,
“evanescent Servant” (cf. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, SWAB 7) (π 23), bí-nishán,
“Traceless One” (cf. SVFV 7) (π 19), a servant who is therefore
mahjúr-i-miskín, “poor and forsaken” (π 20).

As to tamthíl, similitude, allegory, comprising the use of
words describing lofty aspects of nature, in this vein Bahá’u’lláh
alludes to the steadfastness of “a mountain (jibal)” (π 3), the
generosity of a “raining cloud (abr-i-barándih)” (π 4), the
fierceness of a “blazing fire (shu’liy-i-furúzandih)” (π 4) and the
swiftness of a “flash (or lightening, barq)” (π 12). He mentions
“the birds of the air (†uyúr-i-ßa˙rá)” and “the beasts of the field
(vu˙úsh-i-ghazá)” as His only companions (π 11) (cf. “Súriy-i-
Haykal 96, 133), the “oceans (al-abhár),” the “waves (al-ámwáj),”
and the “fruits (al-athmár)” as having never borne what He bore
(π 14). He also alludes to “the immensity of the heavens (fa∂áy-i-
khush, cf. GWB 327, CLII, 6) of detachment ” (π 26).

As to talmí˙, allusion, comprising quotations from the
Qur’án, the Traditions and poems, He writes at least three
Qur’án-like sentences: “Verily He guideth all things into a
straight path” (cf. Qur’án 2:142, 213) (π 19); “Nor is that for God
any great matter” (cf. Qur’án 14:20) (π 20); and “soon you will bite
your fingers’ ends” (cf. Qur’án 3:115; KI 77) (π 31). The first two
sentences are reminiscent of other Qur’ánic verses often
quoted by Bahá’u’lláh, such as “all is from God ” (4:80; cf.
Bahá’u’lláh, SVFV 18), “There is no power or might but in God ”
(18:39; cf. Bahá’u’lláh, KI 252), “Nothing can befall us but what God
hath destined for us” (9:51; cf. Bahá’u’lláh, SVFV 35, reportedly quoted
by Mullá Óusayn in Nabíl 337), God bestows “His grace on such of
His servants as He pleaseth” (2:84; cf. Bahá’u’lláh, SVFV 41),
“Guided indeed is he whom God guideth; but for him whom He
misleadeth, thou shalt by no means find a patron” (18:16; cf.
Bahá’u’lláh, “Four Valleys” 53) and “He doeth what He willeth,
ordaineth what He pleaseth” (2:254, 5:1; cf. Bahá’u’lláh, GWB 116,
LIX, 3). All these Qur’ánic verses convey the idea of divine
power and human powerlessness which is typical of the Bahá’í

writings. They also denote the concept that divine grace enables
human beings to return to God, in spite of their great
weakness. As to “soon you will bite your fingers’ ends” (cf.
Qur’án 3:115; KI 77), it refers to a Qur’ánic passage describing
evil and deceitful people, who, the Qur’án writes, “when they
meet you, they say, ‘We believe;’ but when they are apart, they
bite their fingers’ ends at you, out of wrath” (3:15). Bahá’u’lláh
seemingly uses this metaphor to describe regretting people. In
the same category of talmí˙, allusion, may also fall the many
allusions to personages of sacred history, such as Abraham,
Joseph (Canaanite Youth, ghulám-kan’ání), Imám Óusayn, or
Shimr and yá’júj (the people of Gog), as well as to eschatological
events, such as the Resurrection (qiyámat ).

As to the use of mutirádifát , synonymy, Bahá’u’lláh
describes Himself as “alone and friendless (fardan va vá˙idan)”
(π 10), His departure from Baghdad as “the mightiest testimony
(˙ujjatí) and the most perfect and conclusive evidence
(bur˙ání)” (π 16). Moreover He mentions His “companions
(mu’ánis)” and “associates (mujalis)” (π 11).

Law˙-i-Maryam’s poetics and inner rhythm enable the reader
to fully perceive and share the painful events narrated by Bahá’-
u’lláh and reveal the special love He gracefully nourished for a
woman who was at His service in the dawn of His Revelation.

A pr ov is iona l t r a ns lat ion

He is sorrowful in My sorrow
1\. O Maryam! The wrongs which I suffer have blotted out

> the wrongs suffered by My First Name (the Báb) from the
> Tablet of creation2 and the showers of affliction rained
> at all times upon this veilless Beauty from the clouds of
> God’s decree.
2\. My expulsion from My country was for no other reason

> except My love for the Beloved, and my removal from My
> land was for no other motive but My willing submission
> to the Goal of all desire (ri∂áy-i-maqßúd).
3\. In the summons of God’s decree I was even as a kindled

> and shining lamp and in the time of heavenly trials I was
> as steadfast (thábit)3 as a mountain.
4\. In the revelations of grace I was even as a raining cloud

> and in restraining the enemies of the King of Oneness like
> a blazing fire.
5\. The tokens of My might have become a cause of the envy

> of My enemies and the effulgences of My wisdom have
> turned into instruments of the perfidy of the malicious.
6\. There was not a night during which I rested in a safe

> place, not a morning in which I lifted My head from My
> couch with ease.
7\. I swear by the Beauty of God! Óusayn wept for the

> wrongs I have suffered and the Friend (Abraham) cast
> himself into the fire for My grief.
8\. Were thou to examine carefully the matter, the eyes of

might are weeping behind the Tabernacle of sinlessness and
358                                     Tablet to Maryam: Translation

> the people of glory are moaning in the precincts of loftiness.

Unto this beareth witness the Tongue of truth and glory.
9\. O Maryam! From the land of ˇá (Teheran), after countless

> afflictions, We reached ‘Iráq at the bidding of the Tyrant
> of Persia, where, after the fetters of Our foes, We were
> afflicted with the perfidy of Our friends. God knoweth
> what befell Me thereafter!4
10\. At length I gave up My home and all therein, and

> renounced life and all that appertaineth unto it, and
> alone and friendless, chose to go into retirement. 5
11\. I roamed the wilderness of resignation, travelling in such

> wise that in My exile every eye wept sore over Me, and all
> created things shed tears of blood because of My
> anguish. The birds of the air were My companions and
> the beasts of the field My associates. 6
12\. I passed beyond this fleeting world even as the flash of the

> spirit, and for two years or rather less I shunned all
> beside God, and closed Mine eyes to all except Him, that
> haply the fire of hatred may die down and the heat of
> jealousy abate. 7
13\. O Maryam! The celestial mysteries should not be

> unraveled and it is not pleasing that the heavenly secrets
> be divulged, that is the mysteries of the inner treasures of
> My Soul, this I mean, and nothing else.
14\. By the righteousness of God! I have borne what neither

> the oceans, nor the waves, nor the fruits, nor any created
> thing whether of the past or of the future, hath borne or
> will be capable of bearing. 8
15\. In that period of My exile none of My brothers or any

> other inquired about this Cause, or sought to understand
> it, although this Cause is greater than the creation of the
> earth and of the heavens.
16\. I swear by God! One moment of My journey excelleth a

> service in both worlds (‘ibádati’l-thaqalayn , cf. “Tablet of
> A˙mad,” in Bahá’í Prayers 212), because that retirement was
Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                        359

> the mightiest testimony and the most perfect and
> conclusive evidence. 9
17\. Yea, a man of insight (ßá˙ib-i-baßar) is needed to behold the

> Most Great Beauty (manΩar-i-akbar, cf. “Tablet of A˙mad” π 2)
> and whosoever has no inner eye (baßar) is deprived of
> perceiving the grace of his own beauty, how much more
> of the Sacred and Divine Beauty.
18\. What does the shadow understand of the One Who casteth

it? And what a handful of clay comprehend of a subtle heart?
19\. At length God’s decree ( qa∂áy-i-iláhí) reminded some of His

> spiritual servants of this Canaanite Youth, and with a
> handful of writings they began to make enquiry in all
> places and with all persons until they discovered a trace
> of that Traceless One in a mountain cave. Verily he
> guideth all things into a straight path (cf. Qur’án 2:142, 213).10
20\. I swear by the Sun of Eternal Truth! This poor and

> forsaken One was so astonished and amazed by the
> presence of the newcomers, that this Pen is powerless to
> describe it, unless another sharp Pen (qalam-i-˙adíd) steps
> forth from behind the Immortal Realm, and rends
> asunder the veils, and expounds its secrets with absolute
> sincerity and with the truth of certitude, and with a
> suitable language sets to explaining, and takes the
> celestial pearls out of the shell of silence. Nor is that for
> God any great matter (cf. Qur’án 14:20).
21\. In brief, the seal of mystery was broken by the hand of

> the Unconstrained. Otherwise, none could understand
> but the men of understanding and the detached.
22\. Then, the Day-Star of the World returned to ‘Iráq. We

> found no more than a handful of souls, faint and
> dispirited, nay utterly lost and dead. The Cause of God
> had ceased to be on any one’s lips, nor was any heart
> receptive to its message. 11
23\. Therefore this evanescent Servant arose for the

> protection and the exaltation of the Cause of God, in
> such wise that one would say that a new Resurrection
> (qiyámat mujaddadan) had come to pass, and the greatness of
360                                    Tablet to Maryam: Translation

> the Cause was manifested in every city, and witnessed in
> every land, so that all the authorities showed courtesy
> and good manners.
24\. O Maryam! That this Servant has arisen to face enemies

> of all sects and tribes kindled the envy of the foes, in a
> manner which no one can describe or imagine. Thus hath
> it been decreed by One Who is the Glorious, the Almighty.
25\. O Maryam! The Pen of the Ancient of Days says that

> purifying the heart from everything but God is among the
> most important matters. Therefore, sanctify thy heart
> from all but the Friend, so that thou mayest be worthy of
> the Realm of eternal reunion (bisá†-i-uns, cf. Kitáb-i-Musta†áb
> 197, Kitáb-i-ˆqán 255).

26\. O Maryam! Move from the constraints of imitation

> towards the immensity of the heavens ( fa∂áy-i-khush, cf.
> GWB 327, CLII, 6) of detachment. Cleanse thine heart from
> the world and all that is therein, so that thou mayest
> attain unto the King of faith and mayest not be debarred
> from the Sanctuary of the Merciful. Tear asunder the veil
> of fancy through the power of sublime renunciation
> (inqitá,’ cf. KI 77) and enter into the holy seat of certitude.

27\. O Maryam! A tree has a hundred thousand leaves and

> fruits, but they are all destroyed and wiped out by a
> breath of the autumnal and winter winds. Therefore do
> not distract thy gaze from the Root of the Divine Tree
> and from the Branch of the Tree of divine glory.
28\. Look how the sea is calm and peaceful in its bed in

> majestic dignity and composure. But by reason of the
> gales of the Will of the Eternal Beloved, unnumbered
> forms and shapes become visible on its surface and all
> these billows seem contrary and adverse. And thus all
> people busy themselves with the waves and are shut out as
> by a veil from the might of the Sea of Seas, from whose
> movement the signs of the Unconstrained become manifest.
29\. O Maryam! Be a companion of the Self of the Merciful

> (nafs-i-ra˙mán ) and from the association with and
> resemblance to Satan enter beneath the shelter of the
> sanctity of the Bountiful, that perchance the hand of

> Divine grace may draw thee away from the paths of
> passion unto the heavens of everlasting might and glory.
30\. O Maryam! Return from the fleeting shadows unto the

> Day Star of unfading glory. The existence of all shadows
> endures or moves away by reason of the existence of the
> sun. Should the sun withhold its grace for but a moment,
> everything would end in the pavilion of nothingness. O
> the pity and the regret that people should busy themselves
> with perishing appearances and be deprived of the
> Dayspring of eternal holiness.
31\. O Maryam! Appreciate the value of these days, for soon

> thou wilt not see the celestial Youth in the pavilion of the
> created world and thou wilt behold the signs of
> despondency in every thing. Soon ye will bite your
> fingers’ ends (cf. Qur’án 3:115; KI 77) in your regret and will
> not find the Youth, were ye to search the uttermost
> corners of the heaven and the earth. This is what hath
> descended from the Kingdom of supernal glory. Yea,
> soon thou wilt see the people biting their fingers’ ends in
> their longing for this Youth, and wilt witness see how all
> of them will search after Him throughout the heavens and
> the earth and will not attain unto His presence.
32\. Thus, the matter came to such a pass that this Servant

> decided to come forth among the people of sedition (bayn-
> i-yá’júj , literally among the people of Gog), separated from all
> else except a few women that had to stay with Him. And I
> brought none along with Me, not even the maids of My
> Consort, dependent on what God may desire.
33\. This Youth departed in such a state that My succor were the

> drops of My tears, My confidants the sighs of My heart,
> and My friend My pen, and My companion My Beauty,
> and my army My reliance, and my people (hizb) My trust.
34\. This is what I set forth unto you of the secrets of the

Cause, so that thou mayest be of them who understand.
35\. O Maryam! All the seas of the world and the rivers gushing

> therefrom flow forth from the eyes of this Youth, which
> have taken the semblance of a cloud and weep for their
> oppression.
362                                        Tablet to Maryam: Translation

36\. In short, We offered this head and this soul in the path of

> the Friend for all eternity and whatever may happen We
> are pleased and thankful.
37\. This head at one time was raised on a spear-point, at

> another was delivered into the hands of Shimr, again I
> was cast into fire, and again I was suspended. And this is
> what the infidels have wrought against Us.
38\. And thus, O Maryam, We have marked this Tablet with a

> wondrous lamentation and a vernal weeping, and have
> dispatched it to thee, so that thou mayest moan with ease
> and share the grief of the Ancient Beauty.
39\. Besides, inasmuch as his eminence Jináb-i-Bábá was

> present in the first year and is acquainted with certain
> facts, may God grant that the Holy Spirit bestow
> sincerity and certitude to his tongue and thou mayest be
> informed of a drop of the story of this Youth. We
> remember Óusní Khánum and Íughrá Khánum.
