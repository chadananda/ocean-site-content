### In praise of the Beloved, secretly, in private.

> > #### He is the Exalted, the All-Glorious.
> > 
> > 1\. I was enthralled by light rays from a face  
> >     Whose advent dimmed and darkened every star,  
> > 2\. As though the sunbeams of Her beauty's glow  
> >     appeared and dazzled planets from afar.  
> > 3\. Her joy diffused the musk of the unseen,  
> >     Her stature raised the Spirit up above.  
> > 4\. The End-Time's Trump resounded when She blew;  
> >     Her breath caused shadows of the clouds to move.  
> > 5\. Her gleam reveals Mount Sinai's deathlessness;  
> >     Baha's bright light is kindled when She glows.  
> > 6\. Then to Her west the sun of splendor dawned,  
> >     and to Her east, the moon of moons arose.  
> > 7\. The mistral's fragrance wafted from Her hair,  
> >     and Beauty's eyes were solaced by Her gaze.  
> > 8\. Her shining face gave Guidance sage advice,  
> >     and Moses' soul was cleansed by Her form's blaze.  
> > 9\. The heart of hearts embraced Her eyelid's dart.  
> >     For Her locks' lasso, Being's head was bent.  
> > 10\. Her footprints constitute My highest aim,  
> >     the earth She trod, the most high Throne's advent.  
> > 11\. To win Her I have wept in every eye;  
> >     in exile, I have burned in every fire.  
> > 12\. I spread myself out so that Her foot might  
> >     tread on My heart, and I win My desire.  
> > 13\. I sought to gain Our union everywhere;  
> >     I scrawled letters of nearness on all earth.  
> > 14\. And if I rush to oneness with Her light,  
> >     Then I am cast back, losing closeness' berth.  
> > 15\. And if I plead for union, hands upraised,  
> >     She answers with a sword: "My lovers' prize!"  
> > 16\. The firmness of our bond was My sole care;  
> >     Her goal is our relationship's demise.  
> > 17\. I said, "To meet, I'd offer Thee My all.  
> >     Have mercy, do not publish My disgrace.  
> > 18\. Since I love Thee too well, then make us one—  
> >     That we might for eternity embrace."  
> > 19\. By revelation's secret! Everything  
> >     appeared from Her unveiling. She raised Me!  
> > 20\. By Husayn's sorrow! Emulating Me,  
> >     the world-gyre is weighed down with agony.  
> > 21\. "Thou art My breast's desire, My soul's sole hope,  
> >     My spirit's master and My light, My heart.  
> > 22\. And after My hard journey, let's unite,  
> >     be intimates after My pain apart."  
> > 23\. My incandescence kindled every fuel,  
> >     the Seen world was illumined by My sigh.  
> > 24\. God's sea was dried up by My thirst, which the  
> >     wide stream of glory cannot satisfy.  
> > 25\. And all the gore that I saw on the earth  
> >     bespoke the tears of blood that My eyes shed.  
> > 26\. The ocean's but a drop before My tear,  
> >     The Friend's blaze was, before mine, underfed.  
> > 27\. For My grief froze the great sea of delight;  
> >     the spring of sorrow flowed at My despair  
> > 28\. My grandeur fainted and My brilliance swooned;  
> >     their gloating vanity snuffed out My flare.  
> > 29\. My bones were whittled down, My body worn;  
> >     The fever of My heat burned up My soul.  
> > 30\. Love for Thee felled Me, passion ground Me down.  
> >     To leave Thee melts Me; union is My goal.  
> > 31\. The secret of My sorrow cleft the sky,  
> >     My anguish sundered the earth of the breast.  
> > 32\. The tears in My eyes spoke of My heart's fire,  
> >     My face paled at the sighing of My chest.  
> > 33\. My critics' gloating makes Me wail all night.  
> >     I plead all day since My support is gone.  
> > 34\. For I have reached dishonor's lowest rung,  
> >     so that tongues stutter when they speak thereon.  
> > 35\. The houris in their castles clothed themselves  
> >     in mourning black at My soul's deep despair.  
> > 36\. I've fallen into anguish in all hearts;  
> >     I feel constricted in the open air.  
> > 37\. Then from behind Me She cried out, "Be still!  
> >     and hold Thy tongue from all that it hath told.  
> > 38\. How many Husayns like Thee wanted Me;  
> >     there love Me, just like Thee, 'Alis untold.  
> > 39\. How many intimates I had who were  
> >     thy peers—and loves, superior to Thee  
> > 40\. Who always wail but cannot reach My gaze  
> >     one instant, by the light of unity.  
> > 41\. My dawn makes revelation's sun a star,  
> >     My brilliance makes pure light only a glint;  
> > 42\. My soul's gleam renders Being's secret naught,  
> >     Of My love's flames all bonfires only hint.  
> > 43\. My nature molded the creation's rite;  
> >     the White Palm was withdrawn before My hand.  
> > 44\. The stern injunction came from a clear Cause;  
> >     My wisdom's fairness shaped the just Command.  
> > 45\. The wave within Me stilled the ocean's surf;  
> >     the Holy Ghost stirred at My rapture's lights.  
> > 46\. Immortal Moses swooned before My gaze;  
> >     My gleam destroyed the Sinai of all heights.  
> > 47\. The spread of My Cause quickened all the souls;  
> >     old bones were wakened by My spirit's breath.  
> > 48\. The soul of this Cause circled round its House;  
> >     My visage raised that House's soul from death.  
> > 49\. The B of "speak the secret" swooned before  
> >     My Point! The B hides the realm of high lore.  
> > 50\. All guidance shines forth from My dawning Cause;  
> >     the news of My descent, all the heights bore.  
> > 51\. My bounties lent birdsongs their melody,  
> >     from My tune comes the humming of the bee.  
> > 52\. I rendered Thee a suspect by My Law:  
> >     Thou didst another's love quaff, wrongfully.  
> > 53\. Thou didst bring forth depictions and kinships  
> >     and crave names, thus departing from My way.  
> > 54\. Thou didst describe a self and say it's mine—  
> >     the gravest sin, for therein limits lay.  
> > 55\. Thou didst desire a hopeless union, the  
> >     condition for which Thou must satisfy:  
> > 56\. Thou must drain every cup of fate's ordeals;  
> >     thy heart must spew the blood of tyranny.  
> > 57\. Thou must cut off all hope of comfort's touch;  
> >     Thou must renounce every necessity.  
> > 58\. Thy duty is to shed blood in love's faith;  
> >     a love-scorched soul is fealty to Me.  
> > 59\. Nights spent awake at slanderer's attacks,  
> >     a constant stream of insults all the days;  
> > 60\. In My faith poison's as a healing drink;  
> >     in My Path, fate's wrath is a tender grace.  
> > 61\. Cease claiming to love, or accept all this,  
> >     For thus was it ordained in My Law's scroll."  
> > 62\. In private I called out to Her, "My love,  
> >     My ultimate hope and My heart's sole goal!  
> > 63\. I stand here in the presence of Thy might,  
> >     aspiring to all that Thou dost relate.  
> > 64\. Here I am asking for all Thou dost love,  
> >     then here I stand, prepared for thy mandate.  
> > 65\. My breast yearns for the shafts of thine assault;  
> >     My body craves the swords of cruelty.  
> > 66\. Thy fire's My light, thy harshness is My wish;  
> >     My rest is thy wrath, My goal thy decree.  
> > 67\. Look on the tears of My eyes, how they flow;  
> >     gaze on My inmost heart, how it doth fade.  
> > 68\. Each day the spears of all have struck Me down,  
> >     and each night I died by rejection's blade.  
> > 69\. I read each line of atheism's book;  
> >     each second I heard everyone's rude jeers,  
> > 70\. And faced false charges of idolatry.  
> >     Each day I was transfixed by exile's spears—  
> > 71\. As though fate's woes descended just for Me,  
> >     and fury's blades were sharpened for My neck:  
> > 72\. The grief of Jacob, Joseph's prison cell;  
> >     the Friend's white hot flames, and Job's tragic check;  
> > 73\. And Adam's brooding, Jonah's urgent flight;  
> >     the sad lament of David, Noah's cry;  
> > 74\. Eve's separation, Mary's agony;  
> >     Isaiah's trials, Zachariah's sigh.  
> > 75\. My rain of grief hath sealed the fate of all,  
> >     My flood of woes gave rise to all distress.  
> > 76\. See how I roamed the lands without a friend  
> >     save for the beast within the wilderness.  
> > 77\. At My heart's breaking, springs broke through the earth;  
> >     My open eyes caused heaven's eye to flow.  
> > 78\. My spirit's grief cut short the endless Soul;  
> >     the Most High Throne shook at My suffering's glow.  
> > 79\. Red everywhere was reddened by My blood,  
> >     and from My tears there grew up this world's bower.  
> > 80\. For bitter hurt in thy love's path is sweet;  
> >     From any but Thee heaven's mead is sour.  
> > 81\. And iron's scars can be seen on My neck,  
> >     on My legs marks of fetters yet remain;  
> > 82\. For not a day passed save that I was scorched  
> >     by clear prose and the hints verses contain.  
> > 83\. My spirit disappeared, My heart dissolved;  
> >     My soul boiled from the pain of misery.  
> > 84\. I was left with no spirit, heart or soul;  
> >     that I existed at all startled Me.  
> > 85\. My secret's loftiness convicted Me;  
> >     I wish that My creation never rose.  
> > 86\. For thus have difficulties wiped Me out,  
> >     and thus was I encompassed by My woes.  
> > 87\. Then I ascended and withdrew alone;  
> >     I reached the real Encounter in My heart.  
> > 88\. I saw Thy traits in My eyes' portraiture,  
> >     through Thine eye's glance, which is sharp as a dart.  
> > 89\. If I had limits, they appeared from Thee;  
> >     If I had traits then they derived from Thee.  
> > 90\. Night's darkness was fulfilled when I was roiled;  
> >     My joy refined the daylight's clarity.  
> > 91\. No matter if I am today cast out;  
> >     I saw, when sent forth, the exalted light.  
> > 92\. I knew Jerusalem by the Friend's glow;  
> >     I journeyed in Tihran when taking flight.  
> > 93\. My inner light gave Me faith in the Light;  
> >     I rose up, by the spirit, in My soul."  
> > 94\. I call on thee, life-spirit, to depart;  
> >     within Me, no part is left of the whole.  
> > 95\. Transcendent spirit, climb down from thy throne;  
> >     for thee, My stigma is no source of blame.  
> > 96\. I waken thee, My heart: thou must depart;  
> >     thou hast no honor in this realm of shame.  
> > 97\. My patience: Bear all that which Thou hast seen,  
> >     of hardship and of ease in thy Love's way.  
> > 98\. In spirit, She told Me to persevere:  
> >     "I knew of all the proofs Thou dost display.  
> > 99\. Forget all that Thou hast known and adored;  
> >     idolatry, for Me, is unity;  
> > 100\. For to Me Sinai's brightest glow is naught;  
> >     and the sublimest light is gloom to Me.  
> > 101\. Thy verses' sketch of Me is a child's truth;  
> >     For My subjects, thy words of praise are sound.  
> > 102\. I never ceased to dwell in sanctity,  
> >     and My transcendence hath remained unbound.  
> > 103\. How many just ones, I deemed mere despots;  
> >     how many wise ones I saw as untaught;  
> > 104\. How fleeting were immortals of all kinds;  
> >     how many learned never will know aught;  
> > 105\. How many worshippers have disobeyed;  
> >     how many genuflicting have not kneeled!  
> > 106\. My Being vindicated heaven's psalms;  
> >     My scripture hath unveiled scrolls that were sealed.  
> > 107\. My atom made the cosmic sun revolve,  
> >     My drop evoked great praise from Being's sea;  
> > 108\. The songs of all the creatures were to Me  
> >     the buzzing of a tiny ant or bee.  
> > 109\. All minds turned unto My soul's ecstasy;  
> >     all souls were by My spirit's tune revived.  
> > 110\. My raining Cause made deities divine;  
> >     all Lords have by My ample order thrived.  
> > 111\. The Spirit's realm moved in Me by decree;  
> >     I set My foot down on Mount Sinai's throne;  
> > 112\. At My light the star's radiance blazed forth;  
> >     the sun of rapture at My spirit shone.  
> > 113\. Collected verses, revelation's gleam;  
> >     the Traces and Day-Stars of sanctity;  
> > 114\. Thought's essences and contemplation's gems;  
> >     Light-beams' adornments, wisdom's jewelry.  
> > 115\. The Alpha of My Cause judged everyone;  
> >     all wonders came forth from My soul's good will.  
> > 116\. Thou didst leave Me and reckon thyself near,  
> >     and waters of whim in myth's spring didst spill.  
> > 117\. Thou dost forsake the Unseen's light, in what  
> >     Thou wreakest in thyself—and My works lose!  
> > 118\. Hold fast to the cord of the outward Cause;  
> >     to befriend light's concealed face must Thou choose.  
> > 119\. Rend nearness' veil without a hint! Look on  
> >     the sacred Beauty secretly, within.  
> > 120\. Be silent, for earth's Powers are disturbed.  
> >     Forbear! The Unseen's eyes wept a fountain.  
> > 121\. In Thee is veiled meaning beyond knowledge  
> >     that even radiant minds never knew.  
> > 122\. The holy mystery hides joy and friendship,  
> >     which Thou must not divulge if Thou be true.  
> > 123\. Wert Thou to unmask what Thou didst behold,  
> >     the world would in a trice be lost to sight!  
> > 124\. For thus the throne of glory hath decreed,  
> >     and so ordained the mystery of might.  
> > 125\. They who attain are blessed for they kept faith;  
> >     blessed are they who embrace the wondrous Rite;  
> > 126\. Blessed are the lovers for the blood they shed;  
> >     blessed are the ones who with My love unite.  
> > 127\. Blessed are the sincere, who to the shade of  
> >     My Lordliness made haste from every side."
