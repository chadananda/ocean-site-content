## Significance of the Day of the Martyrdom of the Bab

He is the All-Glorious!\[1\]  
  
O thou illustrious 'Alí-Akbar! \[2\]  
  
This day is the day of the Martyrdom of His Holiness the Exalted One \[the Bab\], may My spirit be a sacrificed unto His sanctified blood.  
  
This Day is the day in which this Sun of Truth concealed itself behind the clouds of mercy.  
  
This Day is the day in which this luminous Orb did set!  
  
This Day is the day in which that pure and refined Being fell upon and rolled onto the blood-soaked earth.  
  
This Day is the day in which His hate-free Breast, like unto a spotless mirror, was riddled by thousands of bullets!  
  
This Day is the day in which that Divine Lamp became severed from its physical frame!  
  
This Day is the day in which the lamentations of the Concourse on High are raised.  
  
This Day is the day in which the inhabitants of the Kingdom, with tearful eyes and throbbing hearts, weep and moan!

\[2\] Mullá \`Alí-Akbar Shahmirzadí, known as Hají Akhund, was a prominent and active believer during the time of Bahá'u'lláh and \`Abdu'l-Bahá. He rendered many important services to the Bahá'í community, including a mission on behalf of Bahá'u'lláh to preserve the sacred remains of the Bab. Bahá'u'lláh elevated him to the rank of the Hand of the Cause. For further details see: The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, Vol. 3, pp. 85-6, 200-1, 425-27, Vol. 4, 495-301 and Memorials of the Faithful, pp. 9-12.
