## Tablet to Mullá Muhammad Báqir-i Tabrízí: Extracts

### by [The Báb](https://bahai-library.com/author/Báb,+The)

translated by [Stephen Lambden](https://bahai-library.com/author/Stephen%20Lambden).


> **About:** Here is an extract from a Tablet of the Bab to the 13th Letter of the Living who became a Bahá'í, Mulla Muhammad Baqir-i Tabrizi (d. Istanbul, c. 1881). It is extracted from an Important Tablet in reply to his question about the Babi Messiah figure _Man yuzhiruhu'llah_ ("Him Whom God will make Manifest"), for Bahá'ís, Bahá'u'lláh. The Tablet begins:
> 
> > "In the Name of God, the Transcendent, the Most Holy. Praised be to God, no god is there except Him, the Mighty, the Beloved One. The Splendour (Baha') which cometh from God (al-baha'min Allah) — exalted be His Remembrance — be upon Him Whom God shall make manifest (man yuhiruhu'llah) — exalted be His command — and upon whomsoever is created through His command, for naught can be seen in Him except what God hath caused to be manifested unto Him, through Him, by virtue of His Utterance, 'Verily, no God is there save Him, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.'"
> 
> Later there is a section which is apparently a eulogium of the Divine Qualities of _Man yuzhiruhu'llah_ (i.e., Bahá'u'lláh). In the original Arabic it is hypnotic in its rhythmic intensity, for in each line there is a double repetition of _ta'ali_ ("exalted be") followed by a Divine attribute. I have somewhat arbitrarily rendered _ta'ali_ "exalted," then "elevated," and "lofty," in three fold patterns. The versification (paragraph numbers) given below is arbitrary. - Stephen Lambden
