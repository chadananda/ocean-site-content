   `Abdu’l-Bahá’s
Treatise on Persecution

of Bahá’ís in 1903

Translated by

Introduction

In the summer of 1903, the Bahá’í community of Iran faced a
series of brutal campaigns of attempted genocide in several cities,
including Rasht, Isfahán and Yazd. When these persecutions
reached their peak in the midsummer of that year, `Abdu’l-Bahá
wrote a treatise outlining events leading to these pogroms, the
motives and actions of the principle persecutors, and the intense
sufferings of the Bahá’í community. Like all His communications
on such subjects, `Abdu’l-Bahá was full of praise for the patience,
forbearance and the conduct of the Bahá’ís, young and old.

In retrospect, it appears that `Abdu’l-Bahá intended this
Tablet to be published in the West, galvanizing the support of
prominent Bahá’ís, and Bahá’í communities in general, in the
United States and Europe. Towards this, He instructed one of His
secretaries, Dr. Younis Khan Afroukhtih, to translate this Tablet,
which presumably was done in collaboration with some English-
speaking Bahá’ís visiting `Akká at the time. This work was further
assisted by an English-speaking pilgrim of Jewish-descent from
Hamadan, Dr. Arastoo Hakim, and was completed on 19
September 1903.

The translated treatise was then sent to the United States to
be published there under the title “Bahai Martyrdoms in Persia in
the Year 1903 AD”. It was received in Chicago on 29 October
1903 and its publication took place through the work of Bahá’í
Publishing Society in 1904. However, for reasons not clear to the
present translator, it was published as a document prepared by Hájí
Mírzá Haydar-`Alí, a prominent Bahá’í residing in Haifa at that
time. The following notation was included:

> “In compliance to the holy command of Abdul-Baha,
> the following account of the recent martyrdoms in

Persia, up to the present time, is herein written and
> submitted for the perusal of the beloved of God.”
> (Signed) Hadji Mirza Heider Ali.

In preparation for its publication, the Bahá’í Publishing
Society only slightly edited the English for a smoother reading and
revised a quotation from New Testament to bring it in line with
copies of the Bible available to the general public.

In the spring of 2004, the present translator coordinated a
typing effort of the 1904 publication to be posted on Internet for
the use of researchers in the Bábí-Bahá’í histories. In April 2005,
Dr. Khazeh Fananapazir brought to my attention that this
document was indeed a published treatise by `Abdu’l-Bahá in
Makátíb `Abdu’l-Bahá, vol. 3, pages 122-47.

This important discovery facilitated a re-translation of the
treatise, which appears below. In the course of the present effort, it
was further discovered that the original translation considerably
differed from `Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablet: sections were moved around,
segments from the original were missing in the translation, various
additions were made in the translation that were not in the original
text, and a number of other deficiencies were noted. And while the
present translation, undoubtedly, also suffers from important
shortcomings, it is more aligned with the original text and
hopefully offers a basis for more befitting renderings in the future.

In process of this re-translation, I benefited from the valuable
suggestions of Dr. Khazeh Fananapazir and Phillip Tussing. All
imperfections in this translation are to be ascribed however to
myself alone.

A synopsis of sorrowful events of [Bahá’í]

martyrs in Yazd and Isfahán

He is God!

In this enlightened age, which is the century of the Almighty
God, by the effulgence of the Sun of Reality, the lights of
civilization are diffused over all horizons, and human attainments
and divine virtues, just as dawn swells in the morning, are so
spread in the East and the West that ferocity and bloodshed among
mankind are abandoned; nay, rather, in civilized countries they are
entirely forgotten. Religious contentions are completely eradicated
and the prejudices of the dark ages are abolished. Among diverse
groups and tribes no conflicts, discords or hostilities have remained
save national conflicts and political ambitions. All peoples and
nations, reposing in the cradle of security and safety, are well
protected against the cruelty of tyrants.

In Iran, when the Divine Call was raised, the radiant morn
appeared and the Sun of Truth arose, many people were delivered
from the lowest depths of ignorance, attained the highest human
perfections, became the center of heavenly virtues, spirit incarnate
and righteousness embodied – appearing in the world of humanity
with spiritual qualities and holy attributes.

However, the adherents of the old religions still held fast to
their former teachings and traditions, and day by day became more
ignorant until they degenerated into ferocious wolves and rabid
dogs, even surpassing the ravenous man-eating beasts.

Thus, they began to oppose those holy souls, each day
instigating persecution, every hour causing new oppressions, each
moment kindling the fires of destruction, burning the sanctified

ones in the flames of hatred and malice, setting their heads upon
spears, torturing, their children, plundering houses and property,
looting wealth and possessions, and banishing women and children
from their native land. The honorable were debased, the revered
were despised, and the virtuous were taken captive.

Among such outrages are numbered the recent events of
Yazd and Isfahán, which caused the hearts to burn and quake, and
the people of equity to shed tears of blood and beat their breasts.

Although the Bahá’ís are brave and courageous, and in the
field of combat each able to battle a large number of opponents,
and when war ensues they manifest such valor as would quickly
break the ranks of their foes1, as it has been proven that in bravery
they have no equal or like, yet, because by the divine and firm
decree of God, they are commanded to maintain universal peace
and entrusted with absolute meekness, when tyrants extend to them
the hand of cruelty, attacking them like blood-thirsty wolves, the
Divine Friends must submit like lambs before them, without
offering the least resistance, accepting the wounds of daggers and
swords as babes accept the honey and milk [from their mother’s
breasts], kissing the hand of the assassin while receiving a stab in
the heart; and, while yielding their lives in the path of God,
begging His forgiveness for the oppressors and asking for
remission of their sins.

This approach and behavior, however, has caused those
ferocious animals and malicious snakes and scorpions to day by
day increase their repression, staining their hands with the blood of
their victims, taking the path of tyranny and never showing any
mercy. In such wise these recent events of cruelty and violence

1848-53 upheavals.

have added to the manifold events of the past, and indeed eclipsed
those afflictions and sufferings of former times.

In summary, this is what occurred. In these days, the `ulama
of the Shi`ite sect, that is, the old religion of Iran, saw that the
Divine Call was raised and that the peoples of the East and of the
West were moved. The effulgence of the Sun of Reality beamed
forth so radiantly that all eyes were brightened, the standard of
God’s Cause was hoisted, and the people flocked in multitudes
under the tent of God’s Words. Shi`ites were converted to the
Bahá’í Faith, and even the Jews were overtaken with such
enthusiasm and fervor that, ere long, none will be found in Iran
who have not accepted this divine guidance. So with the
Zoroastrians – Iran’s ancient religion – who had rejected all the
prophets from Abraham to Moses as well as Christ and the
Messenger of God [Muhammad], but now a majority of whom
have come to accept, believe and confess to all Holy Scriptures and
books of the prophets of God, and they are also recognized as
Bahá’ís in all sincerity and faithfulness.

Thus the witnessing of all these things caused the wicked
`ulamá to be so filled with hatred and jealousy that patience
became exhausted, and at every moment they kindled a new fire of
animosity, instigating and compelling by all possible means the
ignorant rabble and vicious idlers to shed the blood of these
wronged ones.

One of the wicked `ulamá (Najafí2), living at present in
Isfahán, whose father3 stained his hands with the blood of
Sultánu’sh-Shuhadá and Mahbúbu’sh-Shuhadá4, was denounced

\[4\] The martyrdom of these two brothers, the King of Martyrs and the Beloved
of Martyrs, took place on 17 March 1879. For details see: Ishráq Khávarí,

by Bahá’u’lláh as the “Wolf,” and himself as the “Son of the
Wolf.” Everyone wondered concerning the significance of these
titles and what harm will come from him, until recently the
wisdom of these names was revealed, as the following will testify.

The beginning of this turmoil, caused by the wicked `ulamá
and their ignorant followers in Iran, took place in the city of Rasht
in the month of March (1903), corresponding to the month of
Muharram (1321 [A.H.])5. At first the ignorant `ulamá incited the
common people, vagabonds and idlers to loot and rob the friends
[Bahá’ís], and enticed them to commit persecutions and malice,
and these, filled with greed, assaulted like wolves attacking the
lambs of God.

One of their deeds was the disinterment of the body of a
believer who had recently died, after which they cut it to pieces
before setting on fire. During his life this man had shown great
sincerity and kindness to all the people, who, including the
enemies and even the ignorant `ulamá, testified to his moral
character, rectitude, trustworthiness and great love. They said,
“This is a just, honorable and faithful man, but he is a Bahá’í.” His
only sin was that “he was a Bahá’í!” That is, from earthly he
became heavenly, from material he became spiritual, from worldly
he became holy.

Praise unto God! How astonishing! They peruse the Qur’án,
perceiving the counsels and exhortations of God, still they are
fierce and bloodthirsty, and consider oppression to be one of the

requirements of the sacred Shari`at [Islamic Law], thus defaming
and denigrating Islam in the sight of all nations.

The just King of Iran endeavored to restrain these thugs and
vagabonds from their oppression, but found himself unable to do
so. They plundered and pillaged the property of the Bahá’ís, and
bitterly tortured the friends [of God]. This caused the `ulamá to
incite the rabble to commit the same things in other cities of Iran.

One of them is the “Son of the Wolf” in Isfahán. Even though
through various means he has amassed a vast fortune, stealing it all
from the people, is immersed in all forms of carnal desires, and
everyone testifies to his ill-intentions, nevertheless the ignorant
population follows his lead. For the purpose of plundering the
friends’ possessions, they obey his command, extending their
hands to pillage and trying brute force. When this man witnessed
the ascendancy of God’s Cause and the rise of the Divine Words,
his breast was filled with the fire of hatred and jealousy. He raised
the standard of mischief and caused enmity.

He started by confusing the minds of the people by forging a
telegram in the name of the Prime Minister of Iran and ordering his
trusted confederates, under the cover of night, to post four hundred
copies upon the walls of the city. The essence of this telegraph
was: “Shaykh Taqí, the Hujjatu’l-Islam, must protect the religion
(of Islam).” This telegram was a pure fabrication and lie.
Nevertheless when morning came, the rabbles and vagabonds
seeing and hearing of it became excited and proceeded to the house
of Shaykh Taqi, who immediately issued a fatwá6 for murder of the
innocent Bahá’ís.

\[6\] A religious ruling issued by a mujtahid the execution of which is binding
upon the faithful.

It is evident that in midst of such tumult and under such
circumstances when the guide of an ignorant populace issues such
a fatwá what commotion and mischief results. The ravenous mob
invaded the shops and houses of the believers and began to destroy
and pillage. But the divine friends, knowing it to be unlawful to
defend themselves without the permission and consent of the
government, were obliged to appeal to the Governor of the city.
Finding him, for some reason and purpose, negligent in the matter,
they thought it best to gather the dispersed [Bahá’ís] in one place
in order that some course of action might be determined upon.
They assembled in the Russian Consulate, this being the only door
open to them. There they passed the whole night in prayer, raising
the cry, “Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá!” and at times they referred their
difficulties to the Governor, hoping thereby the mob might be
quieted and the meek defended.

The Governor inquired of Shaykh Taqí the cause of the riot
and asked concerning the telegram, what it was and whence it
came. In answer he declared complete ignorance of the telegraph
matter. He then went to the Russian Consulate and erecting a
pulpit, began to outwardly exhort and adjure the mob, which had
assembled to injure and murder the believers, to disperse. The
Governor then addressed a letter to the friends of God saying: “Be
tranquil and at ease. The tumult has ceased and people have
dispersed. Now return to your homes and attend to your work, and
pray meanwhile for His Imperial Majesty, the King of Iran, for
hereafter no one will molest you.” The Governor’s letter was
registered in the Consulate, after which the Bahá’ís came out of
their retreat to go to their own homes.

However, in private, Shaykh Taqí has advised his trusted
men that when believers emerged from the Consulate proceeding
to their own homes, to incite the mob to attack and slay them.
Therefore, when the Friends of God came out of the Consulate to
go home, on the streets, the malicious multitude attacked them like

bloodthirsty wolves, seizing and beating whomever they could.

With utmost viciousness they tortured and wounded in all seventy
people, killing some outright.

The honored Siyyid Abu’l-Qásim Marnuni was one of the
martyrs. This righteous Siyyid was about eighty years of age, and
during his life was renowned in that realm for his piety, faith,
knowledge and virtue. He was evident light and spirit incarnated.
Even enemies bore witness to his chastity and sanctity, testifying
to his generosity, charity and benevolence. He was in truth a help
to the poor, and a refuge and support for the afflicted; his word was
influential, honored and accepted by all the people. In his last days,
once he became known as a Bahá’í, then the people of enmity,
jealousy and denial, attacked him. They themselves testify, “When
we assaulted him, he cried out: ‘We are from God and unto Him
we return. Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá!’” And in the very moment of his
expiration he spoke this verse with great joy and exultation: “You
have done us no harm! You are only delivering us to our Lord!”

While his tormentors, like wild beasts, attacked him with
rocks, clubs, axes and cleavers, he, single and alone, under the
weapons of his evil-doing persecutors who were wounding and
cursing him, suffered it all in fortitude with grandeur and majesty.
He faced the Kingdom of Lights as though he felt not a blow nor
received a wound, but was rather perceiving the open gates of the
Supreme Concourse, and yielded his life to his Beloved with
utmost joy, happiness and exhilaration. O that I had been with him
to partake of his joy and to attain his great happiness!

Finally the Governor seeing the intense of the hostility of
those ferocious wolves, His Royal Prince found no other means
save to arrest and seize the divine friends, and as such many were
protected by being confined in prison. Behold how great was the
outbreak and tumult that the prison-house became a place of refuge

and the dungeon a court of safety. This much is sufficient [and the
graveness of the matter] needs no further exposition.

When the intensity of the violence and tumult had reached its
zenith in Isfahán, a certain Siyyid Ibráhím, son of Yazd’s Imam
Jum`ih, was returning from the cities of sacred Karbalá and
sanctified Najaf. In the exalted `Atabát he had received from
Siyyid Kázim Yazdí, the chief of the [Shi`ite] religion, a fatwá and
authority to shed the blood of the innocent. When he arrived at
Isfahán, and perceived the flames of the fire of tyranny and
persecution, read the forged and phony telegram and saw the
excitement of the people, he determined to hasten forthwith to
Yazd. He received complete instructions from Shaykh Taqí to do,
upon his arrival, whatever would cause destruction to the
foundation of the friends of God. With these wicked intentions he
reached the city of Yazd.

This decadent man, however, perceived that the Governor
would not tolerate such a violation, deeming it to be a cause of riot
and revolt which would result in the destruction of Iran and the
defaming of Iran’s name. Therefore he carefully devised a
stratagem and a ruse. Having arrived by chance upon the
anniversary of the birth of the Messenger of God [Muhammad] –
peace be upon Him – the people of the city came to visit him. In
that gathering he related incidents concerning the rampages in
Isfahán, describing in detail the courage and bravery of the people
who had stood for the annihilation of the Bahá’ís, looting their
wealth and property, and pillaging their possessions and
belongings. At the same time, through pure lie and calumny, he
insinuated that – I take refuge with God! – the just Government
would connive at such action and consent to these violations and
transgressions. In reality, however, His Imperial Majesty and the
illustrious Prime Minister had not a thought save that of justice and
protection for their subjects.

In short, this heartless man commended the people of Isfahán
so greatly that the audience was inspired by religious zeal and
fanatical enthusiasm to eradicate the Bahá’ís. In such ways he
encouraged and provoked many, menaced others who refused to
listen, and instigated the rabble and hoodlums to rob and plunder
[the believers].

As a result, the third day after the arrival of that worthless
[man], either through persuasion or force, a mob of ruffians and
vagabonds was assembled. A great multitude, armed with swords
and daggers, invaded the house of the honored [Haji] Mirza
Muhammad Sini-saz [tinsmith], with sticks and clubs beat and
injured his wife and suckling babes, broke their household utensils
and fixtures, plundered the furniture and demolished their home.
With great force, they pulled the gentle Haji from his house, and
dragged him in the streets until they arrived at a butcher’s shop,
where a bully, like a wild beast, attacked him and with a meat
cleaver, assaulting his blessed head and cutting it deeply, and
causing several more injuries to his chest and side.

It was then that a farash of the Governor arrived and rescued
the poor victim from the hands of his tormentors. His wounds were
so severe, and injuries had been inflicted on him like those by
Shimr and Yazid7, that wronged man was unable to walk, and thus
the farash was obliged to drag him to the court of the Governor,
where he lay motionless.

During this time, his eleven-year old son was at school. His
schoolmates, being urged by their teacher, attacked this innocent
lad. The wretched, tormented child ran to his teacher for protection
and he, having a stone in place of a heart, commanded him to
curse, insult and deny his religion. However, this wonderful child,

\[7\] Yazid, son of the Caliph Mu’awiyah, was the killer of the Imam Husayn in
Karbala. Shimr ibn Siljushan was Yazid’s second-in-command.

with confidence and faith, refused to do so, saying: “I am only a
school boy, unfamiliar with the reality of affairs. How can I stain
my lips with a curse!”

Then that pitiless instructor joined the other school boys,
inflaming the fire of malice and enmity, and committing such a
deed of cruelty which has caused hearts to burn and tears to pour
forth from the eyes of friends and strangers. That inhuman teacher
with his pupils, tortured that dear boy, beating him with sticks,
stabbing him with penknives, picking him with needles and awls in
such a manner that the pen is unable to portray it, tongue cannot
utter it, ears are unable to hear it, nor can heart imagine it.

In short, that light of the martyrs’ eye and the first-fruit of the
Abhá Paradise, at the dawn of youth, manifested such constancy
and steadfastness at the time of martyrdom and hastening to the
divine altar of sacrifice, that brave men were stupefied. The teacher
himself and the pupils would relate, “When we were stabbing him
he only cried out, ‘Yá Baháu’l Abhá!’ and ‘Yá Mahbubu’l-A`la!’
Never wavering an instant, but with greatest joy and delight he
yielded up life to the Life-Giver!” In this manner he attained the
presence of the Supreme Friend in advance of his noble father.

If there be but a particle of justice, it will testify that this
constancy and firmness, this joy and exhilaration, manifested on
the plain of martyrdom, this cry of “Yá Baháu’l-Abhá!” at the
zenith of anguish and pain, is beyond human endurance, especially
when exhibited in a boy of such tender years. Sanctified is He Who
confirmed his heart in God’s love when he hastened to the field of
martyrdom! Sanctified is He Who caused him to utter “Yá
Baháu’l-Abhá!” under the attack of the enemies. Sanctified is He
Who caused his soul to rejoice when ascending to the Supreme
Friend! Verily this is but one of the Signs of the Glorious God!

The blood of that superb child was still flowing when the
malicious crowd killed his illustrious maternal uncle with utmost
cruelty and torture, chopping his body until it was a mass of pieces.
And this prince of faithfulness, under the keen sword of the foes,
was heard saying, “I am content with the fate decreed by God,
redeeming myself for the sake of His Mighty Cause.”

The evildoers then with ropes tied the sacred remains of the
benevolent father, the pure-hearted son and the sanctified uncle,
and disgracefully hauled them through the streets, clubbing and
stoning their mutilated corpses, meanwhile clapping and cheering,
until they reached the town square, where they threw the bodies.

The mother of that fine child, seeing her martyred son, her
husband slain by the severest cuts, and her brother covered with
blood and dust, began to weep and bitterly cry over the wrongs
they had suffered, and especially that of the child. One can imagine
what must have been the condition of that wretched of the worlds,
while being held captive by the people of enmity, upon finding
those sanctified bodies thus hacked to pieces before her.

Such viciousness, ferocity, bloodthirstiness, tyranny and
injustice have not been heard of in ancient or medieval times –
even among the most brutal criminals or the wilds of Africa.
Possibly barbarous tribes, in moments of revenge for massacres
and severe losses in battle, might have produced deeds of similar
brutality. That would be the mere returning of vengeance and
attempting retribution. But such tyranny and gross injustice has
never been witnessed from the hand of foes or the attack of
enemies, as was poured out upon these angelic, pure minded,
trustworthy, righteous and pure hearted souls – people that were
kind to all, well-wishers of the world of humanity, renowned for
their goodly characters, and even praised by their oppressors and
well-known as innocent and guiltless. If we refer to all the histories
of the world, we will see that such oppression and tyranny on the

part of the enemies of God toward the lovers of the Merciful One,
is unparalleled and unequaled, especially when we consider that
not one of these martyrs ever stretched his hand in defense, nor
uttered an uncivil word at the time of martyrdom. Nay, rather, with
utmost concentration on the Supreme Concourse, with humility,
submissiveness, tenderness and exaltation of spirit, they were
praying until they surrendered their souls into the Hand of the Life-
Giver.

Sanctified be God! The government of His Imperial Majesty,
the Shah of Iran – may God protect his dominion – has strictly
forbidden hunters from killing birds during the season of breeding,
or to discharge a gun even into the air, it being considered cruel
and unlawful that during the hatching period the young ones
should be killed, or even startled or troubled by the sound of a gun.
But the Bahá’ís, notwithstanding their innocence and purity, with
righteousness and deeds approved at the Divine Threshold, were
the victims of their own countrymen, and made to suffer such
calamity, and were the object of such enmity. Consider the equity
and tenderness and equity of the Crowned Majesty [the Shah], and
how stony-hearted are the people of the old religion.

In short, on that day, in course of this mighty cataclysm and
the outbreak of this inferno of malice, gates and houses were
burned, dwellings invaded, and they destroyed, beat, killed, and
plundered all. The Governor tried as far as possible to protect [the
believers], but he was unable to do so and his efforts remained
futile. However, the aforementioned Siyyid Ibráhím, who was the
Imam Jum`ih and the chief of the adversaries [of the Bahá’ís],
together with a number of the mischief-makers, went to the
governor’s house. There they outwardly denied being the
instigators of the revolt and troubles, whereas in fact they secretly
provoked the rabble, vagabonds and ruffians, and incited them
with the prospect of booty, spoils and plunder.

The next day, provoked by the iniquitous clerics, the
merciless mob made a greater assault, robbing and spoiling more
than ever. With the severest tortures, they martyred six holy
personages, cutting their bodies to pieces and throwing them into
the town-square, after which they rode horses over the mutilated
corpses of the martyrs and crushed them under the hooves of their
steeds, mixing their blood and flesh with the dust.

Praise be unto God! For one thousand years, the Iranians,
especially the Shi`ites, have been lamenting and loudly weeping
over the tragedy of the Prince of the Martyrs [Imam Husayn] slain
upon the plain of Karbalá – a lamentation that reaches the highest
pavilion of heaven – saying, “The army of the malicious Yazid
mercilessly ran their horses over the body of that Martyred One,
crushing Him under the hooves of their steeds!”

It is because of this that Jesus said: “Your fathers killed the
Prophets of God, but you are building their tombs, visiting them,
prostrating before them, and kissing them.”8 And now this passage
exactly reflects the present condition of the Iranians. With utmost
cruelty and wickedness, certain people martyred Imam Husyan,
and now the children of those murderers are mourning and
lamenting, and building and adorning the tombs of the martyrs.
How heedless and negligent are the people!

In sum, the idlers and vagabonds of Yazd, daily advancing in
tyranny and mayhem, are becoming bolder and more impertinent.

\[8\] Matthew 23, 29-33 states: “Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! Because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the
sepulchres of the righteous, and say: If we had been in the days of our
fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
prophets. Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the
children of them which killed the prophets. Fill ye up, then, the measure of
your fathers. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the
damnation of hell?” [King James Version]

A brief report has reached us that by Friday the number of martyrs
had exceeded one hundred. This special reporter, in a brief letter,
written in great sorrow and sadness, states:

Alas! Alas! And again alas! Our hearts are
> burning! Our breasts are filled with sorrow and grief!
> The cry of lamentation is raised high and the shriek of
> mourning heard in all directions. The hand trembles in
> writing and the heart brims with utmost pain. The eye is
> tearful and the ears unable to hear the account of that
> persistent tyranny. Every day there is a greater
> calamity, and every moment brings a manifest outcry.

In the city of Yazd there are nearly five thousand

> majority is hungry, thirsty and naked. The women
> especially are suffering so keenly on account of the
> slaughter of their fathers and husbands and the
> martyrdom of their brothers, and in such despair that
> they know not how to care for their suckling babes.9

In brief, the steadfastness of these souls under the swords of
persecution, their resignation and acquiesce while facing thousands
of enemies, the joy and exhilaration of these luminous realities at
the Divine Altar, the constancy of the confirmed women, the

verse “the rejectors shall be in great loss” is based on a text in Abdu’l-
Baha’s handwriting. [Makatib’s editor]

strength and faith of the holy maid-servants, patience in coping
with massacre, beating, plunder, and the martyrdom of children,
and the steadfastness of the young children themselves, are all the
greatest proofs of the sincerity and faithfulness of the friends.
Especially when in the time of this oppression and tyranny, they
raised not a hand in defense of themselves, but rather considered
self-sacrifice a great blessing and self-redemption as the greatest
bounty of the world of humanity. They quaffed the overflowing
cup of martyrdom as exhilarating wine. They sought not to
withhold their lives from the sword, nor their throats from the
dagger. They beheld destruction of their homes and dwellings, and
yielded wealth and possessions to the plunderers and pillagers.
Women and children were made helpless and homeless, and with
utmost joy and gladness offered up their lives at the feet of the
Divine Beloved, and without uttering a single word at which their
murderers could take offense. Rather, they entreated intercession
for them, asking God’s forgiveness and blessing upon their
persecutors.

Had they raised their hands in defense, a single soul could
have withstood a large multitude, as was written by one of the
friends from Yazd, his own words being as follows:

God has tied the hands of all, giving no
> permission for defense; otherwise no one would be able
> to be impertinent [towards us]. But, knowing that we
> never transgress the revealed Ordinances by raising the
> hands of resistance, the enemies are able to massacre,
> rob, and shed pure blood with great audacity. Had they
> thought we would defend ourselves, the leaders and
> their followers would not have dared to breathe or utter
> a word against us. We yearn, however, for martyrdom
> in the Path of God, and ask it with all our hearts and
> souls. Only do we implore a refuge for our families,
> wives and children. Should we not do so, we fear we

would be accused of neglect; otherwise, life itself has
> no merit and is not worthy to be offered as ransom in
> the Path of God. If it be accepted, it is our greatest
> honor and glory.

If such martyrdom, submission to pillage and plunder, loss of
home and property, captivity of women and children, giving up of
life with utmost joy, or such a cry in the throes of martyrdom as
“Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá!” or the shout of “Yá Rabbiya’l-A`la!” or the
roar of “You have done us no harm, you have only transmitted us
to our Lord!” or the melody of “Is there no one to witness how I
offer up my life?” – if all these things do not prove steadfastness
and constancy, and demonstrate the greatest evidence of
faithfulness, spirituality and love in these holy souls; then from
what shall we produce the evidence of steadfastness and firmness?
Thus, “seek ye death, if ye are sincere!”10 Should they write the
description of what befell them with the ink of their blood, of a
certainty the pages of the leaves of the world would not be
sufficient.

If these souls be condemned, then from what shall we prove
the steadfastness of the Prophets, the firmness of the chosen ones,
and the constancy of the believers during past centuries? For the
greatest virtue, for which the Prophet [Muhammad] was
commended, was only his ability to “stand steadfast as thou art
commanded.”11

In short, the last information from Yazd, conveyed by the
illustrious Siyyid Mihdi Afnan, the offshoot of the Divine Lote
Tree, is as follows:

\[10\] Qur’an 2:94

\[11\] Qur’an 42:15

The number of the martyrs has reached one
> hundred and seventy pure souls, which we know of. Of
> those martyred that we have not counted, God knows.
> Several thousand houses, shops and stores have been
> robbed and plundered, and many homes have been
> burned. Women and children have been left helpless
> and neglected; left naked, hungry and homeless,
> without a kind protector, or a friend or an assistant or a
> companion. They go from door to door seeking shelter,
> all the while thanking God, day and night, for their
> mighty calamities, saying: ‘Praise be unto God that we
> have received such affliction and hardship in the Path
> of God! We have been the targets for a thousand shafts
> of oppression in the Path of His Love! This was the
> utmost desire of our hearts and souls; this was our
> comfort and the repose of our being.

It was known that these events would take place, and it was
heard from the lips of `Abdu’l-Bahá several times that in a large
assembly of the believers last year He stated unequivocally, “Yazd
is in great peril. Pray for it, pray for it.” By the will of God the
fulfillment of the following passages, written by the pen of
`Abdu’l-Bahá, will also appear: “Ere long, by the Command of
God, the veils will be raised from the Face of His Cause, and its
refulgence will be reflected upon the horizons of the world. The
teachings of the religion will be promoted, the standards of your
Glorious Lord will wave from the highest edifices; the base of
superstitions will be shaken; the veils of darkness will be rent; the
morn of evidences will appear; the Kingdom of Heaven on earth
will shine with the lights of signs. Then ye shall see the banners of
the opposing nations hauled down, the faces of the enemies
darkened, the doctrines of the wicked leaders abolished, and the
believers shall be in great joy while the rejectors shall be in great
loss.”

At any rate, on the morning of that Friday, the mob suddenly
assembled from all quarters, crying while attacking, “Alas, our
religion! Alas, our faith! Alas, our creed!” Previous to this they
had killed five or six persons every day, but on that day the
guarding soldiers, instigated by the `ulamá, allied themselves with
the ignorant rabble, and began to pillage. The vagabonds martyred
a number of the believers, beat the women with clubs, hands and
whips, and looted a large number of shops, stores and homes [of
the Bahá’ís]. Many children became fatherless. Many mothers and
fathers became childless. Many sisters became brotherless. How
many homes were completely destroyed! How many families were
scattered and made helpless and homeless! How great the number
of the affluent that became penniless! How vast the number of
those reared in beds of comfort now compelled to sleep upon the
cold, black earth! How numerous were the wounded and the ill,
with none to care for them or dress their injuries!

In the time of their execution one would cry out, “Is there no
one to witness how I offer up my life?” Another, “Do you kill us
for having believed in God and His signs?” And another, “Alas,
there has appeared no Prophet unto them who has not been mocked
by the people!”12 And yet another would exclaim, “I witness that
there is no God but God!” and “Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá!’ And still other
would shout, “We have kept both Bahá and the khun-bahá [blood-
money]!”13 One was loudly chanting the poem of Varqá, called
“Servitude,” while another, with joy and delight, was bidding
farewell to his assassin, saying, “May God preserve you!” upon the
utterance of which he was struck so violently in the mouth that
from the blow he yielded up his life. And yet another martyr, in the
time of assault by the enemies, stated, “No king has ever been
accorded such majestic pomp and glory!” A handsome youth, at
the moment of death, cried out joyously, “Tonight is the night of

nuptial, and I am to obtain the Beloved of my heart and the Desire
of my soul!”

Praise be unto God! What ignorance is this that the murderers
take the exact last utterances of martyrs, weave them into verses to
be chanted by children in the streets and bazaar, describing the
place this one was martyred, what was his condition, and what he
said, and how such a young man chanted such a verse, and how he
was torn into pieces.

There were two gentlewomen who, while mourning in their
home for their martyred kin, were attacked by a cruel mob. First
they beat and tortured the two wronged women as much as they
could, and then dragged them outside the home, after which they
were stabbed and chopped into many pieces with swords and
daggers.

When the ferocity of the people reached this point, the
Governor, finding himself powerless to stand against the rioters,
fled from the city and retired to the citadel for self-preservation.

Praise be unto God! They seized a baker and with meat axes
hacked him into pieces. Throughout the time of his torture he sang
in a melodious and resonant tone and with great joy announced,
“For ten years I have been longing for this! I beseech God to
forgive and to pour out upon you His bounties, that you may attain
your hearts’ desire, for through you I have attained the desire of
my heart and soul!”

The number of those martyred, up to that day, is reported to
have been more than one hundred and fifty persons within the city
of Yazd. In the surrounding villages, numerous personages were
martyred in each hamlet. The details have not reached us, except a
short report of a telegram received in Tehran to the effect that the
Governor, being pressed by the rioters and compelled by the

vagabonds of the city, was forced to blow one of the friends from
the mouth of a cannon, and to behead another in the town-square.

Briefly, the boorish mob put a woman in a sack, over which
they poured kerosene, and burned her alive. They tightly tied and
nailed another believer to a tree, poured kerosene over him and
burned the tree and the man together.

In Ardakán, a village near Yazd, lived the honored Sadr, the
esteemed Mu`tamidu’sh-Shari`ah, the adored Nizamu’sh-Shari`ah,
and the beloved Diya’u’sh-Shari`ah, with all their families,
kinsmen and relatives. They were of the venerable `ulamá and the
siyyids, and all had received titles from His Imperial Crown. Yet
the `ulamá issued a fatwá demanding the blood of these honorable
souls to be spilled. The ignorant mob, incited by the `ulamá,
attacked those gentle beings with guns, arms and weapons of war.
Though these believers had sufficient number to stand against the
crowd, could have resisted easily and were provided with ample
means of defense, yet, in accordance with the command, “It is
better to be killed than kill,”14 they yielded their lives to the blood-
thirsty wolves who, stretching out their claws of tyranny, martyred
seventeen persons with such the utmost cruelty. Among the victims
there was a young child who fell into a well, and he has survived
and remains alive. None other was left standing. The orchard and
mansion where they resided was utterly destroyed. The trees were
uprooted. All that could be pillaged was taken away, including a
considerable amount of wealth.

The number of martyrs in Ardakán has reached nineteen by
now and in the village of Taft the number was twenty-eight. In
other villages, each suffered one or two martyrs. In Manshád there
were ten. In Dih-Bálá they threw a believer, alive, into a baker’s

oven and roasted him to death. To date, six women have been
martyred. While these many have been martyred, great many more
have been injured and wounded.

Jesus – may the spirits of both worlds be a sacrifice unto
Him! – has plainly pointed out the pathway to the Kingdom,
showing clearly the shortest and surest road. That straight path is
the field of self-sacrifice. Therefore these sanctified souls have but
followed that Effulgent Source [Christ], and through this path have
they proceeded to the Kingdom of Mysteries. For the sake of such
as these He said: “Blessed are they which are persecuted for
righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.”15
“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”16 “Blessed
are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say
all manner of evil against you, falsely, for my sake.”17

Similarly, in the Tablet of Aqdas it is revealed:18

Blessed the slumberer who is awakened by My
> Breeze. Blessed the lifeless one who is quickened
> through My reviving breaths. Blessed the eye that is
> solaced by gazing at My beauty. Blessed the wayfarer

present study and is left for another occasion. For the purpose of the present

insatiate soul who casteth away his selfish desires for
love of Me and taketh his place at the banquet table
which I have sent down from the heaven of divine
bounty for My chosen ones. Blessed the abased one
who layeth fast hold on the cord of My glory; and the
needy one who entereth beneath the shadow of the
Tabernacle of My wealth. Blessed the ignorant one who
seeketh the fountain of My knowledge; and the heedless
one who cleaveth to the cord of My remembrance.
Blessed the soul that hath been raised to life through
My quickening breath and hath gained admittance into
My heavenly Kingdom. Blessed the man whom the
sweet savours of reunion with Me have stirred and
caused to draw nigh unto the Dayspring of My
Revelation. Blessed the ear that hath heard and the
tongue that hath borne witness and the eye that hath
seen and recognized the Lord Himself, in His great
glory and majesty, invested with grandeur and
dominion. Blessed are they that have attained His
presence. Blessed the man who hath sought
enlightenment from the Day-Star of My Word. Blessed
he who hath attired his head with the diadem of My
love. Blessed is he who hath heard of My grief and hath
arisen to aid Me among My people. Blessed is he who
hath laid down his life in My path and hath borne
manifold hardships for the sake of My Name. Blessed
the man who, assured of My Word, hath arisen from
among the dead to celebrate My praise. Blessed is he
that hath been enraptured by My wondrous melodies
and hath rent the veils asunder through the potency of
My might. Blessed is he who hath remained faithful to
My Covenant, and whom the things of the world have
not kept back from attaining My Court of holiness.
Blessed is the man who hath detached himself from all
else but Me, hath soared in the atmosphere of My love,

hath gained admittance into My Kingdom, gazed upon

This is the ransom for the blood of the martyrs! This is the
utmost desire of the near ones! This is the eternal life of the
spiritual ones! This is the pathway of Jesus! This is the way of the
Divine Manifestations, both ancient and modern ages!

However, a comparison of the version in Makatib 3:145-6 against Lawh
Burhan in the original text of the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 57,
suggests some minor discrepancies. For the purpose of this translation,
reliance has been placed on the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf as translated by
