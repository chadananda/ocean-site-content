                               Letters from The Master
to Shahnáz, The Royal Falcon (Louise R. Spencer Waite)

revealed circa 1902-1920
hand-typed 1978; copied to computer 1999

This is the Divine Love story of Shahnaz (Handmaiden of God, Louise R. Spencer Waite) and
'Abdu'l-Bahá (The Servant of the Glory, the Beloved Master).
These Tablets were hand copied by Doris Kirkam from Shahnaz many years ago and have been put
into typed format by Star Saffa, who writes:

> In retyping these Tablets I see them in a different light to when I originally copied them (134
> BE, 1978) from the hand written copies Doris Kirkam gave me that she had hand copied
> from Louise R. Spencer Waite (named 'Shahnaz' {Royal Falcon} by 'Abdu'l-Bahá). I was
> struck to see that many Tablets from America never reached the Master and that while he
> was happy to have Spiritual Assemblies composed of men, or women, or mixed for teaching
> the Faith he did not envision the possibility of Houses of Justice mentioned in the Aqdas
> until such time that the spiritual Teachings would take hold in the world. I now believe that
> it may be why he said 'it will be as clear as the noon day sun" why women would not be
> serving on the House - he thought it was impossible to bring the House into being according
> to a passage in one of his Tablets to Shahnaz. He may have known that the Guardian would
> die without naming another Guardian and therefore may have thought the House would not
> be elected. I think 'Abdu'l-Bahá's major aim was the promulgation of the teachings of amity,
> peace, and love into the hearts of the people of the world. It has been a bounty to reach back
> into time and I am grateful for the opportunity to type these Tablets, and of course grateful
to the "players in the drama".

MY FIRST TABLET, # 1

TO LOUISE SPENCER
UPON HER BE BAHÁ-EL-ABHÁ!

HE IS GOD
O THOU LAMP IGNITED BY THE FIRE OF THE LOVE OF GOD!
I ask God to make thee a sign of love, standard of agreement, means of union and
harmony, and spreader of peace among the people.
O Maid servant of God: Strive with all thy powers in diffusing the spirit of real union among
the people. So that all who are on earth become one family, loving, united agreed, bound
by the bonds of love and united with all harmony in all things and conditions. This is the
greatest happiness of the human race in the world of possibilities and the cause of
reaching unto the Supreme Kingdom, often ascending unto the world of God.

Verily I chanted thy poem. It's significance was beautiful, it's composition eloquent and it's
words excellent. it was like the melody of the birds of holiness in the paradise of El ABHÁ.
The breasts of the maid-servants of the Merciful were exhilarated by it's chanting. Blessed
art thou for uttering forth such an excellent poem and brilliant pearl. Verily these verses
shall be sung in the divine meetings and in the Assemblages of Spirituality in the course of
ages and centuries to come for thou has uttered the praise of thy Lord - the Merciful the
Clement. All poems shall be forgotten in the course of time save those that are
extraordinary. Thy poems shall be chanted with melody and best voices in the center of
Worship (Mashriqu'l Adhkar) forevermore.

heart was dilated by its eloquent sense - I prayed God to make thee utter more beautiful
compositions than this. Thus thou mayest be the first to praise the Beauty of El ABHÁ and
the first to utter His Name among the women. Chant the verses of Guidance among the
people and commence the composition of melodies of great beauty and effect in
glorification of the generous Lord.
We sent thy poems to all countries so that the friends of God may remember thee and pray
for confirmation and aid in this great Cause in thy behalf.

O, maid-servant of God: Thy letter reached me and I prayed God to bless thee by his

Upon her be BAHÁ-El-ABHÁ

HE IS GOD
O! Thou bird of pleasing tones!
Thy little book of poems which are very sweet was received. It was a source of joy for it
was a spiritual anthem and a melody of the love of God. Continue as long as thou canst
this melody in the gatherings of the beloved of God. Thus may the minds find rest and
become in tune with the love of God. When eloquence of expression, beauty of sense, and
sweetness of composition unite with new melodies the effect is ever great, especially if it
be the anthem of the verse of oneness and the songs of praise to the Lord of Glory.
Endeavor your utmost to compose beautiful poems to be chanted with heavenly music.
Thus may their beauty affect the minds and impress the hearts of those who listen.

Upon her be BAHÁ-El-ABHÁ

HE IS GOD
O THOU ELOQUENT AND EXPRESSIVE POETRESS!
How many poets have come into this world who have written elegies and eulogies in the
utmost of eloquence and excellence, but because the meanings were the realities of the
world of nature the effect was produced in the material world and the material world is
limited hence the effects of those meanings are limited. But thou art composer of a poetry
which touches the Divine Realities and Significance's, therefore, they are of the mysteries
of the Kingdom and are unlimited. The poetry of the renounced is perused in the material
meetings. therefore, as long as thou canst endeavor show forth new and fresh meanings
from thy poetry and cause gladness mirth and longing to the spiritual ones.

Received while visiting Mrs. True at Fruitpare, Michigan. Sailed for Acca October 11th with
Dr. Moody, Sydney Sprague, Mrs. Cecelia Harrison. Upon my return to America this Tablet
awaited my arrival as a welcome home. I had written to `Abdu'-BAHÁ after leaving Acca,
while waiting in Port Said to sail to Naples.
To the maid-servant of God Louise R. Waite
O THOU DAUGHTER OF THE KINGDOM

Thy letter was received. Although the dove and nightingale, both of them are two sweet
singing birds, yet in the East, especially in Persia, they call the nightingale a sweet singing
bird and in natural singing they prefer it to all the other birds.
I call thee a Sweet-Singing-Bird o that in the Rose Garden of Significance's thou mayest
raise the harmony and melody of Truth. That the birds of the Kingdom nay soar upward
and become the means of kindness and union between different communities and nations.
The attraction that thou has in thy heart is through the power of the Magnet of the Love of
God. That is thou has become the wooer of the Heavenly Beloved One and surrendered
thy heart to the Beauty of ABHÁ.
Praise be to God that thou art delivered from attachment to this terrestrial world and
attached thy spirit to the Realm of the Kingdom.
Exercise the utmost kindness on my behalf towards Mr. Windhurst.
I ask God that the choral club may become assisted to the guidance of the people, the love
of humankind and the attraction of the hearts.
O maid servant of God - by expression of dove and nightingale the same meaning is
intended because both of them are endowed with sweet melody an song.

Benediction
Of my "Benediction" 'Abdu'l-Bahá wrote this Tablet which came with the last Tablet to me.
To the Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Chicago
The songs and anthem that Louise R. Waite raised in the Assembly of the unity of the
Bahá'ís reached to the ears of the people of the Kingdom, it bestowed joy and fragrance to
the spiritual ones.
I ask God that this song may be sung eternally and this anthem and melody become
everlasting.

To the maid-servant of God Louise R. Waite
O THOU DAUGHTER OF THE KINGDOM!
Thy letter was considered on account of the lack of time a brief answer is given.
The Spiritual Assemblies which are organized for the sake of teaching the Truth whether
Assemblies for men, Assemblies for women or mixed Assemblies are all accepted and are
conducive to the spreading of the Fragrance of God. This is essential. Likewise the public
meetings in which one day during the week the believers gather to be engaged in the
commemoration of God, to read communes, and deliver effective speeches is acceptable
and beloved. But now it is utterly impossible to establish the House of Justice which is
mentioned in the Book of Aqdas. Nay rather it is impracticable and not to be thought of.
That is for the time when the Cause is proclaimed and the commands of God have
become effective. Therefore, now is not the time for the House of Justice which must be
established by general election. It's mention is not permissible and its realization
impossible. Endeavor ye as much as possible that differences may not arise in the affairs.
Let not every insignificant matter become the cause of disagreement. If such conditions
exists the end will be complete dispersion.
The believers and the maid servants of the Merciful must all consider how to produce
harmony, so that the unity of the human world may be realized - not that every wholly
unimportant subject become conducive to differences of opinion. It is my hope that the
friends and maid servants of America become united on all subjects and not disagree at
all. If they agree upon a subject even though it be wrong it is better than to disagree and
be in the right, for this difference will produce demolition of the Divine foundation. Though
one of the parties may be in the right and they disagree that will be the cause of a
thousand wrongs, but if they agree and both parties are in the wrong - as it is unity - the
truth will be revealed and wrong made right.

Tablet on Marriage
The first time 'Abdu'l-Bahá uses my new name he gave me.
To the maid servant of God Shahnaz (Louise R. Waite)
Upon her be BAHÁ'o'llah
O THOU BELOVED MAID SERVANT OF GOD!

Thy letter was received and its contents became known. Among the majority of the people
marriage consists of physical relationship and this union and relationship is temporary for
at the end physical separation is destined and ordained. But marriage of the people of
BAHÁ must consist of both physical and spiritual relationship for both of them are
intoxicated with the wine of one cup, are attracted by one Peerless Countenance, are
quickened with one life and are illumined with one Light. This spiritual relationship is an
everlasting union. Likewise in the physical world they are bound together with strong and
unbreakable ties. When relationship, union and concord exist between the two from a
physical and spiritual standpoint - that is the real union, therefore, everlasting. But if the
union is merely from the physical point of view unquestionably it is temporal and at the end
separation is inevitable. Consequently when the people of BAHÁ desire to enter the sacred
union of matrimony eternal connection, ideal relationship, spiritual and physical association
of thoughts and conceptions of life must exist between them so that in all the grades of
existence and in all the worlds of God this may continue forever and ever. For this is real
union and is a splendor of the Light of the Love of God. Likewise if the souls become real
believers they will find themselves ushered into this exalted state of relationship becoming
the manifestation of love of the Merciful and exhilarated with the cup of the love of God.
Undoubtedly that union and relationship is eternal.
The souls who sacrifice self become detached from the imperfections of the realm of man
and free from the shackles of this world - assuredly the splendors of the rays of the Divine
Union shall shine in their hearts and in the Eternal Paradise - they shall find ideal
relationship and happiness.

O THOU LOVER OF THE BELOVED OF THE WORLD!
Thy new song (at Eventide) and thy notes were received. Praise thou God that thou art
ever engaged and associated with praise and thanksgiving to the promised Beauty with
the harp and violin. I am in Alexandria and I received joy through this song and it will be
sent to Teheran. It happened that in these days the translation of your former song which
was sent to Teheran was received. Your former song was translated into Persian verse by

the maid servant of God Taere Khanum. It is one with great beauty and eloquence. The
translation is enclosed herewith.
Consider and thank God that the power of BAHÁ'O'LLAH has so united and bound the
East and West together that its Persian poetress translates the poems of the American
composer. Be ye admonished O ye who possess eyes. Be ye awakened O ye who
possess minds.

This Tablet was received on Christmas Eve 1910 and was hung on the Christmas tree in
my home decorated for the Bahá'í Sunday School children.
The poem of my Temple song in Persian by Taere Khanum is in the Chicago Archives.
A supplication was written by men and signed by all present at the Sunday School
Christmas Tree party supplicating 'Abdu'l-Bahá to pray to God that the children might all
become as lighted candles on the tree of Life and shed forth the Light of Love to all.
A Tablet received February 23rd contained an answer to this supplication - a "commune
for the children".

Children's Commune
O MY God! O My God! Thou seest these children, branches of the Tree of Life, birds of the
Garden of Safety, pearls of the shells of the ocean of Thy mercy and roses of the rose
garden of Thy Guidance.
O Lord! Verily we glory in Thy praise, we are sanctified in Thee, and supplicate to the
Kingdom of Thy mercifulness to make us candles of guidance, stars of the horizon of Thy
Eternal Majesty among the creatures and teach us from Thy Knowledge O Glory of the
Most Glorious.
YA-BAHÁ-El-ABHÁ!
Verily I shall send thy beautiful and new hymn to Persia so that they may translate and
sing it in the Assemblies.

Concerning the event of the gathering where four of the violet and four of the colored
people with the utmost love and harmony sang the hymn with the utmost joy and fragrance
- indeed this is one of the great signs of God because it hath gathered hearts which were
scattered and filled with hatred, souls which were opposing one another, disputing and
repelling with enmity and made them as one soul singing the astonishing melodies of
harmony in different tones.

Thy letter was received. Correspond always with the maid servant of God, Taere so that it

O YE BELIEVERS WHO ARE ATTRACTED TO THE CENTER OF LIGHTS
Verily there have been various Assemblies in America which were organized many times
and out of these but a few remained firm. Supplicate to the Divine Majesty for the
establishment of every Assembly which hath turned its face towards God, left the scattered
desires, abandoned the self, firm in the Cause of God, as solid mountains which are not
agitated by the winds and violent storms.
Then O ye maid servants of the Merciful, it is incumbent upon ye to be firm, sincere, highly
energetic and in great unity, severed from all save God, effaced and annihilated in the love
of God, sacrificing yourselves under all conditions and circumstance, and glorious so that
you may be filled with the love of El BAHÁ and that in ye nothing remains except the
abundance of El BAHÁ. Should ye arise for these great gifts ye may rest assured that the
confirmation of the Holy Spirit will follow ye in every moment and instant.

O THOU MAID SERVANT OF GOD!
Thy letter was received. Praise be to God that Julia and her respected husband entered
unto the religion of God - and before her husband heard the Greatest Name - he saw the
Blessed Name in the realm of Vision in violet light.
God willing this experience will become the cause of the awakening of the members of the
Masonic Order. If thou knowest of the Lodge of that Order of Masons tell to those who are
in America this experience for those numbers and their equivalent number 19 will become
the cause of their awakening. As the numbers of the Masonic Order have not the
fanaticism of ignorant ones they have the capacity to advance toward the Kingdom of God.
Unquestionably exert yourselves in teaching them the Truth. Thou has written that after thy
return from Acca thou didst become the object of persecution and derision of the ignorant
ones.

When thou were in Acca I told thee clearly of this fact. It is assured that you shall
experience trials for the sake of My Lord. You shall hear derision and mocking and shall
behold persecution and oppression. This has happened in every age. During the days of
His Highness Christ the Jews persecuted and oppressed the apostles and heaped upon
them continually with scorn. But they overcame and withstood all the rest through firmness
and steadfastness. In the same manner you shall at last gain victory and become
triumphant in such wise that all will arise in praise of you and will give you the utmost
glorification and commendation. During the Day of His Manifestation, His Holiness, the
Glorious Christ was called Beelzebub (that is Satan); consider now, His praise and His
glorification is spread all over the world.
The postal card that thou hast circulated was perused. I hope that it may create an
influence and effect among the Masons. Associate thou with the International Peace
Society and convey to its members the greetings of His Highness Bahá'u'lláh.
Correspond thou continually with Taere Khanum and other maid servants of the Merciful in
Persia. God willing I shall write a Tablet in regard to the unity of the women of the East and
the West through Mrs. Brittingham.

O THOU SWEET SINGING MAID SERVANT OF THE ROSE GARDEN OF THE LOVE OF
GOD!
Although you took the trouble and hastened to London yet alas our meeting was not
brought about. But as you returned with the hope of being engaged in service in Chicago
this was identical with a meeting. Spend thy life as much as thou canst in the path of the
Beauty of ABHÁ. With the sweet melody sing the divine words so that the hearts may
become attracted, the souls assured, and the spirits attached to the Heavenly Beloved.

This is equal to a meeting. The flower that the President of the Congress gave to you and
which you sent to me was received and inhaled. It contained a sweet fragrance.

Washington D.C. February 24th 1912

The flower here mentioned was a violet annunciation Lily (a bunch of them was on the
platform at the Races Congress, London, July 1911). The one given to me I sent by Mr.
Sidney Sprague to 'Abdu'l-Bahá. In the same mail with the last Tablet the following one
was received on "music".

Through Mirza Ahmad Sohrab
To Shahnaz Khanum (Louise R. Waite)
O THOU SWEET SINGING BIRD OF THE BEAUTY OF ABHÁ!
This wonderful age has rent asunder the veils of superstition and has condemned the
prejudices of the people of the East. Among some of the Nations of the Orient music and
harmony was not approved, but the Manifested Light (Bahá'u'lláh) in this glorious period
has revealed in the Holy Tablets that singing and music are the spiritual food of the hearts
and souls. In this dispensation music is one of the arts that is highly approved and is
considered to be the cause of the exaltation of sad and despondent hearts. Therefore, O
Shahnaz, set to music the verses and the Divine Words so that they may be sung with soul
stirring melody in Assemblies and gatherings; and that the hearts of the listeners may
become free from the bond of sorrow and sadness and the soul and spirit may rise toward
the Kingdom of ABHÁ in supplication and prayer.

O Thou Kind Lord I am glorified for having heard the call of the Kingdom and having
attained to the goal of my desire. I partook of a share and a portion of Thy inexhaustible
bounties and in the Day of the Covenant have I composed hymns in Thy commemoration
and received the name Shahnaz. O Thou Kind Lord Grant me a shelter in Thy Kingdom so
that night and day I may be engaged in mentioning Thy Name and occupied in Thy
glorification and praise. Bestow upon me at every moment a new Spirit so that with every
breath I may receive a new gift, be accepted at the Divine Threshold and be well known at
the court of the Almighty. Verily thou art the Giver and the Generous, the Kind.

O YE DAUGHTERS OF THE KINGDOM!
There is very little time. All the letters from the East and the West which have come have
remained unanswered but I write this answer to your letters. Undoubtedly whenever two or
three souls gather together in the name of His Holiness, Bahá'o'llah, and are firm in the
Covenant these souls will become confirmed and be conducive in leading others toward
the Most Great Guidance.
Shahnaz then will become Shahnaz (Royal Falcon). Hunt continuously the realities and
significances and sing such a melody as to cause reverberation throughout the pillars of
the city. Praise be God that you are holding together meetings. I hope day by day the
confirmations will be increased. May you advance more completely and be submerged in
the sea of the favor of the Almighty whenever you come together in your meetings and
read this supplication:
O Thou Heavenly Bahá! We are weak and Thou art powerful. We are poor and Thou art
the treasury of Wealth. Confirm us, bestow eternal joy to heart and soul. Keep us far away
from the people of discord. Breathe in us a new Spirit, confer upon us Divine strength.
Render asunder the veils of superstition an cause the shining of the rays of mysteries.
Verily Thou art the kind and Thou art the powerful.

To the Beloved maid servant of God
Shahnaz Khanum
O THOU SWEET SIGNING BIRD SHAHNAZ OF THE BAHÁ'ÍS
the fragrant flower that thou hast sent from the land of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar is at this very
moment in my hand and I am inhaling its sweet perfume.
If on Sundays you got to the grounds of the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar and raise the melody of the
Kingdom of God for those who are present it is very acceptable. But you must speak to
them with infinite kindness that it may exist such a love in your midst that it will influence
them. Then they will see with their own eyes that you are distinguished from the rest of
mankind, that you are overflowing with ecstasy and acclamation and filled with attraction
and joy especially thy self because thou has the harp and lyre and art efficient in music.
when the earthly music is joined with the heavenly music such happiness and acclamation
becomes revealed in the hearts that the spirits will soar heavenward.

Ramleh, Egypt September 1st 1913

Message sent through Ahmad Sohrab from 'Abdu'l-Bahá, Ramleh, Egypt - Sept. 25, 1913
My very dear Bahá'í spiritual sister,
The other day I received your kind letter of August 30th and I was going to write to you at
the command of the Beloved - it came just at the right time. Before giving you His loving

message I must assure you that the Beloved has great spiritual love for you. Let no one in
any way suggest to your mind any other idea.
Now as regards the message of the Beloved. Lately a number of young Bahá'í students of
the American College have come to visit the Beloved. Your Bahá'í poems and hymns
having been translated into Persian and set to poetry by two most wonderful Bahá'í poets,
are memorized by these students and sung in the chorus. They sang the hymn of
"ALLAH'O'ABHÁ" before them. These poems are sung all over the Eastern Assemblies by
men and women with joy and gladness. He said write to Shahnaz give her my wonderful
Bahá'í greetings and write to her "see how your poems are read and chanted by the
Eastern Nations with love and affection. Through the favors of Bahá'u'lláh your name is
well know and these people although they have not seen you, they have grown to love
you. This is the bestowal of the Blessed Perfection for which you must be very thankful."
All the students send you love and Bahá'í greetings and wish you long life and many
blessings. May you write many more Bahá'í poems to cheer the hearts and inspire the
souls with the Love of God and the love of humanity.

Your sincere brother in the Cause, Ahmad
From Ahmad's Diary - writing of these students he writes:
"Every one of them speaks English. They sing the Bahá'í songs and chant most beautifully
the Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh. The Bahá'í songs and anthems of Mrs. Waite (Shahnaz) are
translated in Persian and versified by two of our greatest poets in Tehran. These they sing
with great feeling and emotion. All over the East the poems of our American nightingale, as
the believers tenderly call Mrs. Waite, in their poetic language, are sung by the young men
and women. She is loved and honored because she is the poetic voice of the West crying
in the wilderness of cold skepticism and summoning all the members of humanity to peace
and love. How happy she would be, how glorified she would become, how her eyes would
be filled with tears of joy if she could listen for one moment to the melodious voices of
these Eastern brothers singing her songs with live understanding and sympathy. Through
this happiness she could soar to the heaven of divine nearness."
Message from 'Abdu'l-Bahá through Ahmad Sohrab:
I told the Master about your trip to Minneapolis. He was made very happy to hear from you
and said "tell her that I will pray for her so that she may become more than ever assisted in
the promotion of the Cause of God. This is the most important work. The angels of the
Supreme Concourse shall assist her, the Powers of the Holy Spirit shall confirm her."

Extract from letter from Mr. Getsinger:
We were three weeks in Haifa. The little children of the Holy family and of the believers
have learned Mrs. Waite's songs translated into Persian. And in the evening when the
believers gather their little ones sit down on the divan all anxious to be called upon in turn
to sing these songs. Also the Bahá'í students of Beirut College have formed a glee club
and there they sing her songs. The friends in Persia are learning this version of them.

Message through Dr. Zia Bagdadi contained in a Tablet received by him in April 1914
"convey my greetings to the maid servant of God Shahnaz (Mrs. Waite) and say 'Convey
my greetings and longings to his honor the friendly Minister Mr. Jones in whose Church I
gave a talk. Verily I still mention him and will never forget him.' Convey my greetings to
Mrs. Bates in Minneapolis. Verily I pray God that she may obtain progress and assistance,
may god make her husband firm and bless her son whose picture was sent to me through
Shahnaz. As to the poem which the maid servant of God Shahnaz has composed it is in
the utmost eloquence and beauty. Well done for this unique composition "poem on
Mashriqu'l-Adhkar Grounds". 'Abdu'l-Bahá Abbas

O THOU SWEET SINGING SHAHNAZ!
Thy letter and the Unity Magazine was received. Today the press of the world belonging to
various Nations have taken the opportunity to publish the addresses of the believers of
God and are printing them in their magazines. Consider the power of the Cause of God
that the outsiders like unto the friends are engaged in the promotion of the Cause of God
and are glorying in this distinction although they do not claim to be Bahá'ís.
The Dispensational Day of none of the Holy Manifestations of the Cause of God has been
so powerful as the Day of Bahá'u'lláh. This is the distinguishing mark of His Holiness
Bahá'u'lláh because the friend and stranger are engaged in the glorification of this Cause.
And the believers and unbelievers are acknowledging the majesty and Grandeur of this
Religion. This is indeed a bestowal on the part of my Lord.

From Ahmad’s Diary
Tiberias Sea of Galilee Syria
"It was in one of these mountains surrounding the sea that when Christ saw great
multitudes of people following Him He went up in a mountain and delivered the wonderful
Sermon of Beatitudes. Indeed this is a hallowed token in the glorious Land of Promise and
Divine Performance. The peaceful scene of the opening career of the Redeemer, the
cradle of the Teachings, the country of His Disciples, His chosen retreat when He hid
Himself from His foes. The landscape is felt strongly by many travelers and is reflected in

simple story of the Evangelists. We are carried back to the life on its shores by the parable
of the net, by that of the lost sheep, by the image of the sheep-fold and the beautiful lilies.
These flowers more glorious than Solomon's purple still abound and now He has come
back again to people once more to these shores with sacred teachings and spiritual
healings. As I write it here so that you may sing it in memory of the spiritual days that I
shall live near the Master, and probably our dear Mrs. Waite will compose a new song with
a new message.

> blessed; to one has something from Divine bow. It brings

O THOU SWEET SINGING BIRD!
Thy letter was received. From its contents it became evident that thou has moved from
Chicago to Los Angeles. Praise be to God that thou art engaged and confirmed in the
services of the Kingdom of God. With a sweet melody thou art imparting joy and
exhilaration to the souls and in the meetings. Stir and move the audiences through the
heavenly call.
Arise thou and offer due thanks for this bounty because thou art assisted in such a great
Cause. The results of thy services thou shalt find in the Divine World, the limitless
Universe of the True One. Their fruits will likewise become apparent ere long in this world.
I praised the article that thou has written concerning the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar. Thou has
taken much trouble in the correspondence of numbers. The digit 9 is the perfect number
and other higher numbers are the repetition of 1 to 9. For example 10 is the repetition of
number 1. 20 is the repetition of number 2. 100 is the repetition of number 10. 1000 is the
repetition of 100 ad infinitum. Consequently the most perfect and the greatest digit is
number 9. Extract as far as thou canst the hidden significance from number 5 and 9. thy
reasoning and thy power of thought are very penetrating.
Thy poem "Sons of God" that thou hast forwarded was in reality very wonderful, sweet,
eloquent, fluent and its meanings all thrilling. Strive thou in the composition of such pieces
so that at all times the pure river of poesy may flow from they tongue. The maid servant of
God was ascended to the Divine Kingdom: Taere wrote a matchless translation of their

poems. She always translated them into Persian poetry which made them very beautiful.

Keep the letters that the has with thyself for many letters mailed from America do not reach
us. Praise be to God that the meetings in Los Angeles are in the utmost state of unity and
concord. This news brought to us great happiness. Convey on my behalf to each and all of
the believers my loving greetings and kindness.
Thou has written about Ella Wheeler Wilcox. The respected lady has infinite capability.
She is like a lamp filled with oil which no sooner comes in contact with fire that it is aglow.
Now it is thus hoped that she may become enkindled with the Fire of the Love of God and
her Torch become so luminous as to illumine all directions. A letter is written her name.
Deliver it to her.

Thy letter from Los Angeles was received. Than Divine Providence that thou has been
assisted in service and has been the cause of the promotion of the Oneness of humanity.
Not until the darkness of differences among men is dissipated will the Pavilion of unity cast
its shadow over all regions; otherwise rest and comfort, peace and reconciliation are
unachievable. This illumined age requires and necessitates its fulfillment. Every century
has its ideal which in accordance with that century is confirmed in this illumined era. That
which is confirmed is the Oneness of humanity. Every soul who serves this Oneness will
undoubtedly be assisted. I hope that in the Assemblies thou mayest sing praises with
sweet melodies and thus become the cause of joy and gladness to all. Convey on my
behalf greetings and respect to thy revered husband.

To the maid servant of God Louise R. Waite, Los Angeles, California
Upon her be Bahá'u'lláh-El-Abhá
O THOU DEAR MAID SERVANT OF BAHÁ'U'LLÁH!
The letter thou has written to his honor Mr. Tudor Pole was perused. It is just what thou
has written, namely that the question of supreme importance center around promulgation
of the Divine Teachings. This is conducive to amity among all denominations and races
that dwell on the earth, it links together the East and the West, bands closely together the
North and the South pillars of the pavilion of the Oneness of the world of humanity, lays
the foundation of universal peace, emancipates mankind from the gloom of the world of
nature, and elevates it to the illumination of the Kingdom, secures freedom for all the
hearts, and gladdens the souls with the glad tidings of God.
As to the question of reincarnation of which thou has inquired it is better for thee to refer to
the Book of Certitude (Ighan) revealed through the Supreme pen where the question is
fully treated. This is the explicit text of the Divine Utterance and therein thou shall find that
it has been manifestly declared that by "return" is meant the "return of human perfection's
and Divine Illumination". The Book of Ighan has been translated and possesses the
decisive verdict. Consider and peruse it with the utmost carefulness.
Concerning childish activities of some which you have written about. Praise be to God thou
has been able to fulfill admirably thy mission. Thou hast armed with the power of the
Covenant resisted and surmounted these unwise and foolish attempts. Thou has protected
the Cause of God and has striven to expose and reveal the Truth to the people of that
region. These people are like unto children at every hour they exhibit a fresh and puerile
attempt, but all that is likened to a ripple on the surface of the water. Ere long thou shall
consider that no sign and no trace shall remain there from.
The ocean of the Covenant shall send forth a wave that shall disperse and throw out these
foams. Consider thou at the time of Christ and think how many childish attempts have
been made by different persons. What claims they have advanced and what a multitude
have they gathered around themselves?
Even Arius attracted to himself a million and a half followers and strove and endeavored to
sow the seeds of sedition in the Cause of Christ, but eventually the sea of Christ surged

and cast out all the gathering parts and nothing was left behind save ever lasting
valediction.
My friend engage in the promulgation of the Divine Teachings that ye may serve in a
distinguished manner the Oneness of the world of humanity, may be the means of the
propagation of Universal Peace, that the world of mankind nay reflect like unto a mirror the
Divine Kingdom and that the light of the realm on High may shine in the nether world.
Convey on my behalf to all the friends and particularly to thy respected husband, Mr.
Waite, the utmost love and kindness.

An answer to their supplications which I sent with one from myself January 2nd 1919

To maid servant of God Shahnaz Waite, Los Angeles
Upon her be the Glory of God the Most Glorious
O! DEAR DAUGHTER
Thy letter was received. It's contents were understood. Thy aim is very high and thy
intention superb. The President of the Republic had beneficial purposes but time and
situation did not comply. All the 14 points which were contained in the President's
proclamation were revealed years ago in the blessed Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh. Of them one
is the universal peace but His most high Bahá'u'lláh clearly says that the Assembly of
Universal Peace must be composed of members from all Nations and Governments, even
from the small States.
Had it been done in this way difficulties would not have arisen. At any rate we pray for the
President and supplicate comfort and ease for him so that he may perhaps perceive Divine
breathings, may in the latter days of his life attain a new life, attach his heart to the
Kingdom of God and be freed from the painful thoughts of this world.

For thy sake I was going to write a letter to him but time does not permit. He is at present
submerged in sickness and politics. His mind is occupied, such letters have no effect on
him.
As to the prisoners since they are in prison they have capacity for education. Therefore thy
being in touch with them can bring them to a new consciousness. May it be that some
souls among these prisoners may be reformed and become presentations of the Divine
Bounties.

Received in San Diego March 1920

With this Tablet was one enclosed for my San Quentin class in answer to a supplication
signed by them and sent to the beloved by me.
O YE AFFECTED ONES!
Though imprisonment is calamitous and the cause of discomfort and every prisoner
depressed and disappointed; yet his calamity may rise to remorse, free the breast for the
understandable Kingdom of God.
If you obtain this freedom to such a degree as to forget the prison, that is to make your
hearts occupied with God, act according to the Divine Teachings, meditate humbly day
and night and supplicate to the Kingdom of God there will be no doubt that ye will be
released from the gloomy conditions and enter the realm of Light.
Then imprisonment shall become freedom, the narrowness of the prison shall turn into
hearts invigorating. Space and pains and sorrows shall be changed into boundless
happiness.
Now my hope is such that ye may recognize the light of Truth in the darkness of prison,
that ye may in that narrow confine search for the extensive space of the Kingdom, that ye
may in that locality of affliction secure heavenly bounty and be directed by Divine
Guidance so that ye may undergo a second birth and with the fire of the love of God, with
water of Life, and with the Holy Ghost ye may be baptized. At that time ye shall realize that
imprisonment was the essence of Divine Beauty, and affliction the cause of the comfort of
heart and soul.

O THOU WHO ART THE DAUGHTER OF THE KINGDOM
Thy letter has been received. Due to the scarcity of time I write in answer briefly. The body
of man which has been formed gradually must similarly be decomposed gradually. this is
according to the real material order and Divine Law. If it had been better for it to have been
burned after death in its very creation it would have been so planned that the body would
automatically become ignited after death, be consumed and turn into ashes. But the Divine
Order formulated by the Heavenly Ordinance is that after death this body shall be
transformed from one stage to another, different from the preceding one so that according
to the relations which exist in the world it may gradually combine and mix with other
elements thus going through various stages until it arrives in the vegetable kingdom. There
turning into plants and flowers and developing into trees of the highest Paradise, becoming
perfumed and attaining the beauty of color. Cremation suppresses it speedily from
attainment to these transformations, the elements becoming so quickly decomposed that
transformation to these various stages is checked.
Convey on my behalf my utmost love to thy honored husband. I am supplicating that he
may day by day attain to spiritual development as regards the meeting which has been
formed in that city. It is my hope that - that Assembly may become illumined and like unto
a rose garden and it diffuse sweet fragrances.
Convey on my behalf respectful greetings to Miss Mary Fenn. In reality this dear maid
servant of God has arisen in service deserving of the bestowal of the Divine Bounties. I
should like to write a letter to the friends in San Diego but scarcity of opportunity - I suffice
with a short supplication for them:
"O THOU THE LORD OF HOSTS!

The city of San Diego was like a lifeless body. Now a Breath of the Spirit of Life has wafted
over these regions; some souls have arisen from the graves of the world of nature, which
is the eternal death! They have been revived through the Holy Ghost and they have started
in servitude to Thy Threshold.
O thou affectionate Lord! Bestow upon these feather and wingless birds two heavenly
wings and give unto them spiritual strength so that they may soar into limitless space and
attain to the apex of the Kingdom of Abhá.
O Lord, strengthen these feeble seedlings so that each one may develop into a fruitful tree
exhibiting the utmost freshness and liveliness. Assist them and make them victorious so
that they may rout and vanquish the army of ignorance and misapprehension, while lifting
up the Banner of Love and Guidance among the people, bestowing like unto the spring
breeze freshness and life unto the tree of humanity (giving greenness and life) like unto the
Spring shower to the meadows of that continent. Verily Thou art Able and Powerful, the

O THOU DEAR SERVANT OF GOD!
The details and ideas that thou has written in thy letter was read. The news of the
promotion of the Word of God in Los Angeles imparted infinite rejoicing - for in the course
of the brief day I was there in that state. I scattered pure seed in rich and virgin grounds.
Praise be to God that they are sprouting and day by day the beauty and greenness of the
Divine Farm is growing and developing. There is no doubt that the blessings and heavenly
"Benediction" shall encircle it and ere long innumerable souls shall allay their thirst from
this pure mountain. Praise be to God that meetings are organized and the Holy Fragrances
are being diffused.
Thou has written concerning love, marriage, and divorce. Love is the moving principle of all
the phenomena. It is the first Divine Grace and its effects are apparent and manifest in all
the degrees of existence. Marriage is the essential and the outward fruit of Love. It is the
cause of affinity and communication between two souls. This affinity and love has an
eternal foundation therefore divorce is abominable and detestable at the Threshold of the
Almighty. For God has desired for man amity not hatred; He has desired for him unity and
not separation. Not with standing this weighty consideration when no harmony and accord
is obtained between two souls and they loathe and abhor each other's association and
both sides feel continual torment and anguish, unquestionably separation from each other
is better because both are suffering and union is impossible. But they must take hold of
this last means when all other resources of reconciliation are exhausted. Perchance union
may appear again and the two souls be united permanently and peacefully. When at last
union becomes impossible of a realization and positively unattainable then divorce is
permitted.
Convey on my behalf respectful greetings to the sweet singing bird of the Rose Garden of
Wisdom Shahnaz Khanum. I always remember her and pray for her conformation and
