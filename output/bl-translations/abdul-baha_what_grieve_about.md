> **About:** This text is online in Persian at [reference.bahai.org/fa/t/c/PA1/pa1-68.html](http://reference.bahai.org/fa/t/c/PA1/pa1-68.html#pg67). It was published in _Payam-i-Asmani_ Volume I, page 67 (Payam-i-Bahai). The original Tablet does not have a title; it has been given the name "What is there to grieve about?" due to the repetition of that phrase.

He is God!

O faithful servant of the Ancient Beauty!

Thy life is sustained by the Most Great Name, O sufferer in tribulations. What is there to grieve about?

The waves of bounty are each a sea. The sea of misery is but a dewdrop.

What is there to grieve about?

The onslaught of enemies is the darkness of the night. The confirmation from the Abha Kingdom is the effulgence of the morn.

What is there to grieve about?

The taunting of the ignorant is like unto the buzzing of a fly. The Concourse on High, the answering call of the savior.

What is there to grieve about?

The feebleness of the covenant-breakers are like unto the movement of faithless ants. The awe-inspiring might of Covenant is the kingdom of heavens.

What is there to grieve about?

Nations foundations are built on air. The Cause of God is erected on a fortified palace on a peak of an exalted mountain.

What is there to grieve about? What is there to grieve about?

May glory rest upon thee!

        —   'Abdu'l-Bahá
