A Short Poem by “Darvísh” Muhammad, Bahá’u’lláh:

Sáqí az ghayb-i baqá burqa‘ bar afkan az ‘idhár
An Introduction and Three Versions of Provisional English Translations

by Franklin D. Lewis

he corpus of Bahá’u’lláh’s writings, all of which Bahá’ís regard as scripture, consists overwhelm-

T      ingly of prose. These prose works assume a variety of forms and genres, often explicitly indicated

by formal terms appearing in the titles given to the individual works, such as tablet (lawh, súrih),
epistle (r is ál ih), book (kitáb), etc. In the Arabic and Persian tradition, prose (nathr) can be simple (mur-
sal) or adorned (marsú‘), the most common type of adornment being saj‘, collocations of parallel phras-
ings which observe rhyme. Many of the prayers and other writings of Bahá’u’lláh rely heavily upon saj‘,
and indeed, some of his compositions, such as “Halih, halih yá bishárát,”1 observe some, but not all, of
the rules of classical metrics and prosody. As such, they transcend the category of rhymed prose (nathr-
i musajja‘) and exhibit litany-like features that might be classed as a form of versification (n az m) or quasi-
verse.

In addition to these prose works, there are also a number of poems (shi‘r), which meet the classical
conventions of Persian and Arabic verse, including meter and rhyme. Among these poems by Bahá’u’lláh,
both the “Qasídiy-i Varqá’íyyih” (The Dove Ode) and “Rashh-i ‘amá” (The Sprinkling of the Div in e
Cloud), were mentioned by Shoghi Effendi, and discussed by Adib Taherzadeh.2 In recent decades, pro-
visional translations of these two poems have appeared.3 The longer “Mat hn avíy-i Mubárak,” first dis-
cussed by Adib Taherzadeh, has now also appeared in a provisional translation.4

In addition to the above, Bahá’u’lláh composed a number of shorter poems which he signed in the last
or penultimate line with the nom de plume, or takhallus, of “Darvísh” (the Derv is h). These shorter
poems, which were apparently composed in the mountains of Sulaymáníyyih in Iraqi Kurd is tan in the
mid-1850s, conform to the traditional Persian verse forms of the qasídih (a longer ode) and ∞§azal (a
shorter, sonnet-like, lyrical form), observing mono-rhyme, the conventional meters and other prosodic
rules. Though they have been published at least once in the original,5 they have not yet been studied, and
remain as yet untranslated to English.

Many of the themes that appear in Bahá’u’lláh’s longest poem, the Mat hn avíy-i mubárak, which was
evidently composed over a period of time, beginning perhaps as early as his retreat to Iraqi Kurdistan,
and certainly by his time in Baghdad, but completed only after his arrival in Istanbul,6 are already in
evidence in these shorter poems of “Darvísh” (the Dervish) which apparently date from his retreat in the
mountains of Iraqi Kurd is tan. Bahá’u’lláh left Iran for Baghdad in the first half of the month of
Rabí‘u’th-thání, 1269 A.H., or more precisely on the first of Bahman,7 corresponding to 21 January
1854\. Very shortly after his arrival in Baghdad, it became clear that the dissensions and confusion with-
in the Bábí community in the wake of the execution of the Báb, and the apparent appointment of Mírzá
Yahyá as successor, threatened to fracture the community. Bahá’u’lláh, whose presence and eminence
apparently constituted a threat to Yahyá, therefore decided to withdraw.

Shoghi Effendi tells us that on 12 Rajab 1270 A.H. (10 April 1854) Bahá’u’lláh set out on his own,
leaving his family behind in Baghdad, accompanied only by a Muslim servant, Abu’l-Qásim of

Lights of ‘Irfán

Hamadan, who was soon killed by thieves. After this Bahá’u’lláh lived in seclusion in “the garb of a trav-
eler;” since he was carrying a kashkúl, or alms-bowl, and had assumed the name Darvísh Muhammad,8 he
must have been living the life and wearing the clothes of a mendicant de rv ish or pious recluse, that is
to say, a Sufi. As his son, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, describes it:

> D ur ing this period Bahá’u’lláh lived in poverty. His garments were those of the poor and needy.

His food was that of the indigent and lowly....9
Shoghi Effendi tells us that Bahá’u’lláh first lived on a mountain called Sar-Galú in a crude stone
structure, and sometimes even in a cave. According to Bahá’u’lláh’s own testimony in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán,
he often went without food or rest. During this period he composed many prose and verse “prayers and
soliloquies” in both Arabic and Persian.10 Subsequently, he was invited by Shaykh Ismá’íl of the
Khálidí yy ih Order, to reside in their Dervish Lodge (takyih or Turkish tekke) in Sulaymáníyyih; in addi-
tion, Bahá’u’lláh made personal contact with leaders of other Sufi orders, specifically Shaykh ‘Uthmán
of the Naqshbandí Order and Shaykh ‘Abdu’r-Rahmán of the Qádirí order (to whom Bahá’u’lláh later
addressed The Four Valleys).

The information in God Passes By seems to suggest that these poems signed “D e rv is h” date to the ear-
lier phase of Bahá’u’lláh’s residence at Sar-Galú, probably some time between the Spring of 1854 and the
Winter of 1854–55. However, we cannot yet completely rule out the possibility that they were composed
later, while at the Khálidí lodge in Sulaymáníyyih, or perhaps even in the period shortly after his return
to Baghdad. The Kitáb-i-ˆqán addresses itself to specific matters of Shiite and Bábí theology and repre-
sents a break with the Sufi and gnostic vocabulary of Bahá’u’lláh’s earlier poems and of his Seven Valleys
and Four Valleys. Though it dates to a period prior to Bahá’u’lláh’s announcement of his claim to be the
advent of “Him whom God will make manifest,” the ˆqán strongly suggests its status as divine revela-
tion and explicitly claims authorship for Bahá’u’lláh.11

By contrast, the poems of “Dervish Muhammad” do not speak openly with the voice of Bahá’u’lláh,
and do not explicitly lay claim to revelation. Although they do broach messianic themes which, viewed
in the light of Bahá’u’lláh’s later claims, can be seen as veiled allusions to the eventual public procla-
mation of his claims in April 1863, the context of Sufi poetry would have made it quite easy to discount
any implication that Bahá’u’lláh was laying claim to a special station.

As to the authorial voice in the early poems of Bahá’u’lláh, they were composed under a sobriquet,
“Darvísh,” or Dervish. The conventions of the ghazal and, to a lesser extent, the qasídih, called for the
author to adopt a poetic persona, which is evoked by name (takhallus) in the body of the poem (e.g., “O
Hâfez...”). The takhallus is the poet’s adopted stage name, by which he is generally known (Sa‘di, ‘Attâr,
Sanâ’i, etc.). In a ghazal, an apostrophe to his stage persona usually occurs in the last line, sometimes
in the penultimate, or more rarely in the first line of the poem. In the particular case of Bahá’u’lláh,
“Dervish” apparently served not only a poetic pen name, but also as the name he assumed, “Dervish
Muhammad,” while living incognito in Sulaymání yy ih. This moniker “Dervish” appears as the takhallus
in the final line of at least eight poems of Bahá’u’lláh.12

The first poem of Báha’u’lláh, dating to his incarceration in the Siyáh Chál and known by its open-
ing words as “Rashh-i ‘amâ,” employs “Bahá” as takhallus in the penultimate line:

ranniy-i nâ’í bín k-az kilk-i Bahá mí-rízad.

> See how the lamentations of the reed piper
> pour forth through the reed pen of Bahâ13
Bahá’u’lláh also alludes to himself with the pen name “Bahá” in his Mathnaví, which was apparently
the last formal poem he composed. In the poem translated below, there is also a reference to Bahá,
though it does not appear in the position of the takhallus. If composed or circulated among Naqshbandi
or Khalidi Sufis,14 in whose company Bahá’u’lláh was known as Dervish Muhammad, the word Bahá
would not have been understood as an allusion to himself. Most probably, it would have been understood
as an homage to the eponymous founder of the Naqshbandi order, Bahá al-Din Naqshband (717–791 A.H./

\[84\] A Short Poem by “Da rv í s h” Muhammad

1317–1389 A.D.). However, “Dervish,” which occurs in the final line, the traditional place for the poet’s
takhallus, would have been understood as the “signature” of the poet, in this case, “Darvish
Muhammad,” if he shared any of these Persian poems with the people in Sulaymáníyyih, and it seems
likely that he did, since he composed the “Qasídiy-i Varqá’iyyih” at the request of the Sufis he met there.

The meter of the poem, like the “Mat hn avíy-i Mubárak,” is Ramal, though the measure here is octame-
ter Ramal (ramal-i muthamman), as opposed to the shorter hexameter Ramal (ramal-i musaddas) of the
Mat hn aví. The Ramal meter is based upon a repetition of the basic four-syllable foot | - 4 - - | (where
[ - ] represents a long syllable and [ ] a short syllable), according to quantitative (not accentual) mea-
sure. One line, or stich (bayt), of octameter Ramal consists of eight such feet, divided into two equal
and symmetrical hemistichs (misrá‘) divided by a caesura. In this particular poem, the fourth and eighth
foot of each line are truncated to three syllables | - - |, and described prosodically as catalectic (mahd-
húf). The full pattern of one line of catalectic octameter Ramal, or Ramal-i muthamman-i mahdhúf,
would therefore look like this:

Foot: 1          2        3       4     a       5       6        7       8 a

| -   - - | -   --| -   --| -       -   || - - - | -    --|-   --|-    -|
In the first line of a ghazal or qasídih, the final syllable before the caesura and the final syllable of
the line rhyme with one another. Thereafter throughout the poem this same mono-rhyme repeats as the
f in al syllable of each line, in the pattern aabacada, etc.15

Interestingly, the hemistich (misrá‘) in which the takhallus “Darvísh” appears in this particular poem
(the first half of line 15) does not follow the same meter as the rest of the poem. Rather this half-l in e
conforms to an entirely different meter, pentameter Hazaj-i akhrab-i mak fú f, which happens to contain
three more syllables than the rest of the lines, as follows:

-- |    -- |    -- |    --   | - - ||
This is a violation of traditional metrics, as a poem should follow the same meter throughout. This
isolated variation here might suggest that this hemistich has been quoted from another poem and embed-
ded here (tadmín), or perhaps added at another time as an after-thought. However, this is not the only
instance in which the meters appear to change within a given poem of Bahá’u’lláh. For example, the
poem mastand bulbulán zi naghmiy-i Yá Hú-yi ú begins in the first line with a meter not conventional-
ly recognized as prosodically acceptable (mustaf‘ilun mafá‘ilun fa‘ilátun fa‘al: - - - - -   - - -), but
shifts after that to Ramal.16

Several of the poems signed “Dervish” utilize the conventional wine imagery of classical Persian poet-
ry, involving a call to the Sáqí, or cupbearer, to pour out a round of wine. In some settings, such as the
royal wine poem, the scene is one of merry carousal and wassailing. In other settings, wine is drunk as
a palliative to drown out the sorrows of the world. In yet other contexts, wine is symbolic of the intox-
ication brought about when in the presence of the numinous, or of the mysterium tremendum; it can
also symbolize the overriding of rational perception that the gnostic feels in his overpowering love for
God. Clearly, the wine in Bahá’u’lláh’s poems stands in this tradition of mystical inebriation, as is made
clear in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. This symbolism also appears in the Seven Valleys, to which the poem we are
presently considering bears a certain resemblance in enumerating some of the stages along the path of
the spiritual quest (see line 4–5, where the stages of Love and Poverty are alluded to, and lines 5 and 8,
which explicitly speak of the path).

Here then is a provisional prose translation of one of the ghazals of Bahá’u’lláh, Sáqí az ghayb-i-baqá,
which is signed in the voice of Dervish Muhammad.17 As has been argued elsewhere, because Shoghi
Effendi never translated any of the formal poetry of Bahá’u’lláh, we have no authoritative models for the
translation of the poems of Bahá’u’lláh. I have therefore attempted to render this poem in three differ-
ent versions, to provide examples of the options ava il able to us in translating scripture, which is origi-
nally in the form of verse.

1. A Provisional Prose Translation
This translation seeks to state in clear idiomatic English, without, however, being overly literal and
without expl an atory interpolations, the meaning of the poem. Each hemistich of the original poem is
translated on a separate line. This, then, is a lineated prose version of the poem; the lines are numbered
for easy reference.

2. A Provisional Free Verse Version
In the English version that follows, I have attempted to give a more literary form to the poem. Unlike
the Persian, it is in free verse, with no pre-determined meter and no effort to rhyme. I have also allowed
for greater freedom in rendering the English, breaking the lines to create rhythmic phrasing or to high-
light the mean in g. Those who have translated literary works will recognize that the translator is often
compelled to make an idea or metaphor or phrase that was suggestive or ambiguous in the original lan-
guage, more determined in translation, because ambiguity and suggestive language cannot always be
transferred. Where the original metaphors seemed vague or suggestive, I have allowed some leeway in
searching for a poetic equivalent in this translation; these divergences will be apparent by compar is on
with the previous translation. The line numbers are included to facilitate compar is on between the two
versions.

3. An experimental version in Double-Sonnet Form
In translating, if one submits to the constraints of meter and rhyme, one must inevitably sacrifice
some degree of precision of the mean in g. Whether or not the intangible benefits of sonorous and pat-
terned speech will atone for the loss of literalness is in large part determined by the nature and objec-
tives of the original text. In the various translations of the poetry of Rumi,30 who is said to be the best-
selling poet in North America, one may observe two rather contrasting paradigms: those whose aim it
is to preserve the precise meaning of what Jalálu’d-Dín is teaching in his verse, and those who feel that
the poetry of how those ideas are expressed is of equal importance to the content of what is being said.

What follows is a rendition of the poem into an adaptation of a traditional English verse form, the
sonnet, a stanza of fourteen pentameter lines observing a rhyme pattern of ababcdcdefef gg and a meter
that is roughly iambic. Bahá’u’lláh’s poem in the original Persian has fifteen lines of thirty syllables, or

\[88\] A Short Poem by “Da rv í s h” Muhammad

about 450 syllables. An English pentameter sonnet consists of fourteen lines of approximately ten sylla-
bles each, for a total of roughly 140 syllables. Obviously, therefore, a single sonnet cannot convey the
entire line-by-line meaning of this poem. Although Shoghi Effendi has, in some cases, chosen to leave
out parts of tablets he translated (for example, the final sentences of the Tablet of Ahmad, which give
instructions to convey greetings to various individuals, and do not really contribute to the meaning of
the prayer), it seemed to me that this poem should be translated without altering its narrative progres-
sion or excising any of the matters it covers.

I have attempted to do so in the sonnet doublet that follows: two sonnets joined together by a final
couplet, for a total of thirty lines. A more capable poet might produce better results, but this will at
least provide the reader with a comparand for the two preceding versions, to illustrate by example what
might be ga in ed, as well as what is lost, in choosing to translate a traditional Persian verse form into a
traditional English verse form.
Cupbearer, rend the Ever Unseen’s veil—

and let me quaff the Maker’s wine celestial
> With what you keep in kegs, love’s bile won’t heal
pour out a sea of Spirit’s vintage special

> to make this frenzied but concealed one stir,
> to rouse him from divine inebriation!
> Light up a blaze of love, burn up the world
> then enter in the lovers’ habitation.

> You must first die to attributes this-worldly
> to taste that Idol’s wine-drenched ruby lips.
Pass earthly realms and enter Poverty

whose refuge over realms eternal looks.

> If your heart loves dear life, step no farther;
> But come on if you’ve life and heart to offer!

> Such is the custom of the path that joins
> Bahá; be off if you can’t take the pa in .
> But if to learn Love’s secrets your heart pines
> —turn back from pride with eyes to wisdom open
> then you may see Mount Sinai circling round
and feel Chr is t’s spirit spiring for the Friend

> whose tresses spell God’s Unity as found
> on cheeks like pages sanctified from sin
> From love’s life-giving spring drink bl is sful wine
> And cast your head in victory at his feet
Inspire these folk, Messiah of the Time,

who tread so lifeless down the Friend’s own street ,
> with living breath, to break the body’s cage
> and soar like birds to God’s abiding place

> Dervish, divine fire’s scorched all souls, burnt worlds!

Revive them now with this lament of yours…

Notes
1) A provisional translation of “Halih, halih yá bishárát” was offered by Stephen Lambden in Bahá’í Studies Bulletin 2:3

> (December 1983): 105–112. A revised version of this now appears at www.bahai-library.org/provisionals/hallelujah.html,
> along with another (more metrical) version by Sen McGlinn. Most of Bahá’u’lláh’s prayers observe some degree of rhymed
> prose (saj‘), but he also authored a number of heavily cadenced, rhyming, litany-like prayers, such as “The Tablet of the
> Holy Mar in e r,” the Long Healing Prayer (‘Anta’l-Káf í Anta’sh-Sháfí), or “Bulbul al-f ir á q” (which has been translated by

11) The colophon, which appears to have been added when the book was originally composed, uses the terms nuzzila and

> manzúl, Koranic terms for revelation “sent down” by God. It also states that it was revealed by the Bá and Há, an allu-
> sion to the letters of Bahá. The introductory paragraph in Arabic to the Hidden Words (Kal im á t-i maknúnih), also uses
> this Koranic vocabulary of revelation (nuzzila, what was sent down of old).

13) This motif of Bahá’u’lláh as the flutist blowing through the reed pipe is developed more fully later towards the end of

> his Mat hn avíy-i Mubárak, where it alludes to the opening lines of Jalál al-Dín Rúmí’s Mat hn avíy-i Ma‘naví. The pen in
> pre-modern times was also cut from bamboo reed, like the flute, and carved on one end into a nib, which was dipped in
> ink. Hence, the pen and the pipe are both made of a hollow reed.

> Studies in Bábí and Bahá’í History, vol. 2 (Los Angeles: Kalimat Press, 1984), pp 1-28, and the articles “Bahâ al-Dîn
> Naqshband” and “Baghdadi, Mawlânâ Khâlid Ziâ al-Dîn” by Hamid Algar in Encyclopædia Iranica.

> 15) In poems with a refrain (radíf), the rhyme appears as the final syllable in each line just prior to the repeated refra in .
16) Má’idiy-i ásmání, 4:194–6. This first line would appear to be a combination of feet from the mudári‘ and mujtathth (or

possibly sarí‘) meters, but does not conform to one of the accepted meters.

> 17) The text comes from Má’idiy-i ásmání, 4: 209–10.
18) Safrá’, or yellow bile, is one the four humors in traditional Galenic medicine. Love sickness was believed to result in an

> excess of this bile, which would turn the pining lover’s face pale or jaundiced. One of the other humors, sawdá’, or black
> bile, is also associated with the melancholia of love sickness.
19) Mastúr-i shaydá’í might be understood as one veiled/hidden and mad (with love), or it might be understood as one veiled

by the madness of love.
20) The theme and wording of this line is similar to the sentence in which the wayfarer enters into the Valley of Love in

> Bahá’u’lláh’s Seven Valleys. Fawran bi vádíy-i ‘ishq qadam gudhárad va az nár-i ‘ishq bi-gudázad, and a bit further on, nár-
> i ‘ishq bar afrúzad, which in the translation of Marzieh Gail and Ali Kuli Khan, The Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys
> (Wilmette, IL: Bahá’í Publ is h ing Trust, 1945), p. 8, reads, “...he shall straightaway step into the valley of Love and be dis-
> solved in the fire of love,” and “the fire of love is abl az e.”
> 21) Mard-i ráh suggests a traveler on the Sufi path, one on the spiritual or even mystic quest.
22) Faqr (poverty—being poor in the things of the self and of this world) is a station along the Sufi path; Bahá’u’lláh

> includes it as the seventh and final station in his Seven Valleys, as Faqr-i haqíqí va faná-yi aslí, “True Poverty and Absolute
> Nothingness” in the Gail and Khan translation, Seven Valleys, p. 36. Line five alludes to the need to become fání, usu-
> ally translated in western works on Sufism as “ann ih il ated,” but which Gail/Khan rendered in its noun form faná as
> “nothingness.” It may be more accurate to describe this state as effacement of the individual personality in the Godhead.
23) The word Bahá here would probably have been taken in Sulaymaníyyih as an allusion to Bahá al-Dín Naqshband, as

\[90\] A Short Poem by “Da rv í s h” Muhammad

> noted above, since Bahá’u’lláh was living there incognito as “Dervish Muhammad.” However, when shared with a Bábí
> audience, as they later must have been in Baghdad, this would certainly have been seen as a reference to Bahá’u’lláh.

24) See the sim il ar theme of opening one eye and closing the other in the Hidden Words, Persian #12.
25) “Him” would appear to allude to the divine “Friend,” who has until now been veiled in the Unseen Realm.
26) Daftar means an album or small book, but seems to suggest a sacred writing here, hence “Tablet,” though the words

usually so translated by Shoghi Effendi are lawh or súrih.
27) Mushaf is actually a codex, or a manuscript book, but it has a particular association with the Koran or sacred scrip-

> ture, and is not the typical word for book (kitáb). In English, scroll seems to better suggest the sacred book (through its
> association with the Torah).
28) Bahá’u’lláh here juxtaposes two terms from Islamic theology, tawhíd (the affirmation of the absolute unity of God; here

> translated as “affirming the Divine Unity”), and tajríd (sanctification of God from all attributes, and contemplation of
> the abstract divine essence; here translated as “God’s sanctified Essence”). Bahá’u’lláh pairs these two words in the
> rhyming position in line 63 of his Mat hn avíy-i Mubárak.
29) In this hemistich, the meter of the poem changes to | - - | - -        | --    | - - | . As noted above, the classical

rules of prosody do not allow for this variation.
30) Caveat lector: Many, perhaps even most, of those who have publ is h ed “translations” of Rumi actually know no Persian;

> they rework the translations already done by others into a particular vision and version of what is poetically successful.
> It stands to reason that those who, out of ignorance, do not feel the constraints and ambiguities of the original language
> are less apt to feel this tension between fidelity and poetic beauty.
