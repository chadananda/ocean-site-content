Prayer for Shaykh Káẓim Samandar
Authorised Translation of Bahá'u'lláh’s Múnáját-i-Jináb-i-Samandarí

The following prayer was recently translated by the Bahá’í World Centre.
By way of introduction, we cite here excerpts from two explanatory letters
on behalf of the Universal House of Justice regarding, first, the provisional
translation of this prayer, and subsequently its authorized translation in its
present form.

From a letter to an individual from the Department of the Secretariat,
Universal House of Justice, dated 29 August 2001.1

> “Your email of 16 August 2001, enquiring on behalf of a few
> believers in your community about the authenticity of a prayer which
> begins with the words “O my God! Thou seest me detached...”, was
> received at the Bahá’í World Centre. The Research Department of the
> Universal House of Justice has advised that the prayer in question
> was revealed by Bahá’u’lláh to Jináb-i-Samandar [Shaykh Kázim
> Samandar], the father of the Hand of the Cause of God, Ṭarázu’lláh
> Samandarí, to assist him in making a difficult decision. The prayer
> was to be recited 19 times, followed by meditation on the problem,
> the formulation of a solution, and the implementation of the
> conceived solution. There is no authorized translation for this prayer.
> However, as it was noted that the electronic copy of the prayer which
> you appended to your message differs from the version held at the
> World Centre, we provide the following provisional translation for
> your information. You may be interested to know that the Research
> Department has ascertained that the prayer was revealed in Arabic
> and is published in Majmú’iy-i-Alváh-i-Mubarakiy-i-Hadrat-i-
> Bahá’u’lláh (Tihrán: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 132 B.E.), page 9,
> transcribed by ’Andalib.”

From a letter to an individual from the Department of the Secretariat,
Universal house of Justice dated 1 Jan 2006

> “Your email of 2 November 2005 has been received at the Bahá’í
> World Centre and forwarded to our Department for response. The
> prayer that you quote is authentic. It was revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in
> Arabic for Jináb-i-Samandar (Shaykh Káẓim Samandar), the father
> of the Hand of the Cause of God :Ṭarázu’lláh Samandarí, to assist
> him in making a difficult decision. The Research Department has no
> information about the date of its revelation. As you may be aware,
> until now only provisional translations of this prayer were available.

Short Prayer for Decision

Sín Mím [Samandar], upon him rest My glory, hath ever been the recipient
of divine favours, and there hath befallen him in the path of God that which
His knowledge alone can encompass. In regard to his affairs, let him repeat
nineteen times: “Thou seest me, O my God, detached from all save Thee
and cleaving unto Thee. Guide me, then, in all mine affairs unto that which
profiteth me for the glory of Thy Cause and the loftiness of the station of thy
loved ones.” Let him then reflect upon the matter and undertake whatever
cometh to mind. This vehement opposition of the enemies will indeed give
way to supreme prosperity.
