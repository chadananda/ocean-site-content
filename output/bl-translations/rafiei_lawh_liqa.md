       In the Presence of the Beloved:

Bahá’u’lláh’s Law˙-i-Liqá’

A Revised Provisional Translation and Notes

Nima Rafiei

One of the central tenets of previous religions is the promise
of attainment unto the presence of the Lord on the Day of
Judgment for the faithful believers. Within the Islamic
dispensation in the Arabic text of the Qur’án, the term liqá’
and its various derivatives indicates the promise of attainment
unto the presence and meeting with the Lord. There is
indication in some of the sacred scriptures of the past that
attainment unto the presence and meeting the chosen prophets
and messengers of God is considered the same as that of God.
How significant, therefore, that during the lifetime of
Bahá’u’lláh so many of His devoted and ardent followers
tarried and journeyed long distances to see only a glimpse of
Him from afar. Bahá’u’lláh has fundamentally transformed the
concept of attainment unto the divine presence in His
Revelation. He has written a fascinating and lucid epistle,
referred to in this paper as the Law˙-i-Liqá’, in which He
unequivocally states that reading it is equivalent to being in His
presence. In this paper, we will briefly introduce the Islamic

472                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

background of liqá’, compare Shí‘ih and Bábí-Bahá’í
interpretations of attaining the liqá, and we will demonstrate
that the writings of Bahá’u’lláh infuse and transform the
concept of attaining the divine presence to manifold events
including being in the presence of God’s prophets, messengers
and manifestations, reading the divinely revealed scriptures,
and undertaking service to mankind with detachment and pure,
spiritual motivation.

The title Law˙-i-Liqá’ or “Tablet of the Divine Presence” has
been supplied by the renowned Bahá’í author and scholar,
‘Abdu’l-Óamíd Ishráq-Khávarí (1902-1972) in his extensive
compilation on the writings of the Central Figures, Má’idiy-i
Ásmání (vol. 8).1 For the purposes of this study, the same title
will continue to be used. Additionally, the opening of the same
tablet is quoted and reproduced by Fá∂il Mázandarání (1882-
1957) in the fifth volume of his book, Asráru’l-Áthár.2 The text
of the tablet has been published in the first volume of the
Áthár-i-Qalam-i A’lá series, also known as the Kitáb-i-Mubín,3
and is based on a copy in the handwriting of the renowned
scribe and devoted follower of Bahá’u’lláh, Zaynu’l-
Muqarrabín.4 Although there is a minor typographical error in
the latter version, the Research Department at the Bahá’í World
Centre has provided the authentic text of this tablet for the
purposes of this translation and study.5 Additionally, the
Research Department at the Bahá’í World Centre has reported
that neither the biographical information on the date and
location of the revelation of the Law˙-i-Liqá’ or the identity of
its intended recipients is not known at this time.6 Before
exploring the text of the tablet in question, we will discuss the
Islamic background of the term and phenomenon of liqá’.

Liqá’ in Islamic sources

While this is not intended to be a thoroughly comprehensive
survey, it will serve the purpose of this study well to provide
some brief context on the liqá’ from Islamic sources. The word

Bahá’u’lláh’s Law˙-i-Liqá’                                     473

liqá’ occurs in more than twenty passages in the text of the
Qur’án. In most of these instances, it is translated as “meeting”
in English to indicate the anticipated meeting with the Lord on
the day of Resurrection. In a comprehensive encyclopedia on
the Qur’án written by Bahá’u’d-Dín Khurramsháhí, he has
provided a thorough and detailed list of the various verb forms
and definitions of the word liqá’; most occurrences of the word
liqá’ and its various derivations indicate a physical meeting
between two persons. He identifies several instances where liqá’
is used, such as “Lost are they who deny the meeting with God
until ‘the Hour’ cometh suddenly upon them! …” [Qur’án 6:31],
and “But as for those who shall not have believed, but treated
our signs and the meeting of the next life as lies, they shall be
given over to the torment” [Qur’án 30:16], and also in this passage
“Taste then the recompense of your having forgotten the
meeting with this your day. We, too, we have forgotten you:
taste then an eternal punishment for that which ye have
wrought…” [Qur’án 32:14].7 Dr. Khurramsháhí has also mentioned
that various interpretations of the liqá’ may occur in a
figurative sense in referring to inspiration experienced by
individuals.8 Ishráq Khávarí has also quoted from and supplied
various passages of the Qur’án and Shí‘ih ˙adíth sources
regarding the liqá’ in his Qámús-i-ˆqán.9 He demonstrates that
throughout history, the various commentators on the Qur’án
have had various interpretations of the meaning of liqá’, with
some quoting verses such as 7:143, in which God tells Moses
that He will never see Him to mean that the liqá’ is likely
figurative and not literal, whereas verses from the Súrih of
Qíyámah have been quoted to suggest that it is a literal event:
“On that day shall faces beam with light, Out looking towards
their Lord…” [Qur’án 75: 22-23].10

It would be beneficial and perhaps better serving the interest
of the reader to briefly present a contemporary Shí‘ih
viewpoint and understanding of the liqá’u’lláh in order to
compare and contrast with statements in the writings of
Bahá’u’lláh. In this space we can refer to one of the writings of

474                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Áyat’ulláh Khumayní, the leader of the Islamic revolution of
1979\. In one of his books, Áyat’ulláh Khumayní compiled and
interpreted forty ˙adíths of the Imáms and the Prophet
Mu˙ammad. The twenty-eighth quotation supplied by
Khumayní is attributed to the sixth Imám, Ja‘far aß-Íádiq,
whereupon when Imám Ja‘far was asked if God loves to meet
those souls who are longing to meet Him, he replied that God
too is longing to meet them. The tradition goes on to report
that should one dislike the meeting with God, He in turn
dislikes having to meet such a soul at the time of his or her
death. Khumayní provides his discourse on various aspects of
the tradition, not all of which are directly relevant here, but he
does make some comments reflecting his attitude and
understanding of the liqá’ and meeting God. He carries out his
interpretation as an indirect criticism of Ṣúfí and mystical
thought.

Khumayní mentions in one instance “some” of the ‘ulamá
have blocked the path of the liqá’u’lláh and deny the possibility
to directly experience the “revelations of the Divine Names and
Essence.”11 He begins by saying that although it is not far-
fetched to conceive such a viewpoint, it is hard to maintain and
becomes implausible when it is compared with other Qur’ánic
verses and texts. He then later turns his attention to
highlighting the position of “those who have kept open the path
of liqá’u’lláh” (possibly a reference to mainstream ‘Ußúlí Shí‘ih
‘ulamá); that this path has been kept open by “…the
impossibility of fathoming the Divine mystery through
universal knowledge (‘ilm al-kulli) and by the means of rational
thought and the impossibility of encompassing It in mystic
experience (‘Irfán al-shuhúdi) and by the means of esoteric
insight.”12 From this point on, Khumayní directs his criticism at
those who claim “the luminous veil of the Names and the
Attributes” can also be removed, whereupon they attain and
imagine themselves close to the Essence of God. Khumayní
argues that since humanity, in its natural state, is “entrapped in
the dark veils of corporeal nature and entangled in the chains of

Bahá’u’lláh’s Law˙-i-Liqá’                                   475

petty hopes and expectations…and should we come across a man
of vision and someone with a heart who attempts to lift the
curtain from these veils, we consider it an error and affront…”13
it is therefore unimaginable for human beings to be capable of
such spiritual transcendence from what he terms the realm of
“mulk” or “earthly possession.” He later clearly states, “Hence,
the way to God-seeking is that one should at the outset devote
his time to the remembrance of God and acquire the knowledge
of God and the Names and Attributes of that Sacred Essence,
the usual way from the adept (masháyikh [shaykhs]) of that
science.”14 Khumayní further writes that if one does not learn
the “theoretical and practical exercises and austerities” or is
“not familiar with learned jargon” then he cannot occupy
himself with remembrance of the Beloved.15 It appears,
therefore, that Khumayní’s interpretation of attainment unto
the divine presence is multi-fold and restrictive to specific
criteria; namely, that individuals are only able, upon both
seeking and acting upon the knowledge of God through well-
learned clergy, and acquiring a working knowledge and
understanding of theological practices and highly-specific
terminology and concepts, to properly carry out the
remembrance (dhikr) of God. With this in mind, we see that the
Bahá’í writings and Khumayní’s interpretations of attaining
unto and understanding the divine presence are clearly
different, as Bahá’u’lláh has ordained that the individual should
engage in the search for spiritual truth, detached and un-
influenced by old sciences and methods and standards of
religious learning acquired from men.16

Liqá’ in the writings of The Báb and Bahá’u’lláh

The Báb gives an interpretation and discourse on attaining
the divine presence within the text of His weightiest book, the
Persian Bayán. In the seventh chapter of the third unit of the
Persian Bayán, The Báb makes some fundamental statements:
first with the opening Arabic verse of the chapter in which He
states that the intended meaning of liqá’u’lláh is the attainment

476                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

of the presence of Him Whom God shall make manifest (Man
Yuẓhirihu’lláh) as none can ever see God in His essence,
secondly that the whole of creation hath naught been brought
into being save for the attainment unto the presence or meeting
with God, and lastly that all who have sought and attained the
presence of Him Whom God shall make manifest, have attained
unto the divine presence of the Lord.17 With this interpretive
framework in mind, it is important to note that the Kitáb-i-
ˆqán written by Bahá’u’lláh is considered by Bahá’ís as the
completion of The Báb’s Persian Bayán. Within the text of the
ˆqán, Bahá’u’lláh also interprets and defines the meaning of
liqá’. He brings forward some of the main verses of the Qur’án
which mention liqá’ and gives commentary on their true
meaning in Persian within a few pages. The passages include:
“They who bear in mind that they shall attain unto the Presence
of their Lord, and that unto Him they shall return,”18 and “Let
him then who hopeth to attain the presence of his Lord work a
righteous work.”19 He writes in summary:

> The knowledge of Him, Who is the Origin of all things,
> and attainment unto Him, are impossible save through
> knowledge of, and attainment unto, these luminous
> Beings who proceed from the Sun of Truth. By
> attaining, therefore, to the presence of these holy
> Luminaries, the ‘Presence of God’ Himself is attained.
> From their knowledge, the knowledge of God is
> revealed, and from the light of their countenance, the
> splendour of the Face of God is made manifest. [KI 131]

In the following passage, He also states:

> Therefore, whosoever, and in whatever Dispensation,
> hath recognized and attained unto the presence of these
> glorious, these resplendent and most excellent
> Luminaries, hath verily attained unto the ‘Presence of
> God’ Himself, and entered the city of eternal and
> immortal life. Attainment unto such presence is possible
Bahá’u’lláh’s Law˙-i-Liqá’                                      477

> only in the Day of Resurrection, which is the Day of the
> rise of God Himself through His all-embracing
> Revelation. [KI 131-132]

Elsewhere, Bahá’u’lláh affirms this same definition in His
Epistle to the Son of the Wolf:

> In all the Divine Books the promise of the Divine
> Presence hath been explicitly recorded. By this Presence
> is meant the Presence of Him Who is the Dayspring of
> the signs, and the Dawning-Place of the clear tokens,
> and the Manifestation of the Excellent Names, and the
> Source of the attributes, of the true God, exalted be His
> glory. God in His Essence and in His own Self hath ever
> been unseen, inaccessible, and unknowable. By Presence,
> therefore, is meant the Presence of the One Who is His
> Vicegerent amongst men… [ESW 118]

The same passage has been quoted by Fá∂il Mázandarání in the
second volume of his compilation, Amr va Khalq, although it is
attributed to the ˆqán.20 In another instance, the Tablet of
Visitation recited at the Shrines of Bahá’u’lláh and The Báb
refer to the divine presence: “I bear witness that he who hath
known Thee hath known God, and he who hath attained unto
Thy presence hath attained unto the presence of God” [BP 231].
Here we see clearly that Bahá’u’lláh confirms and expands upon
what The Báb has written in the Bayán.

It is important to note that beyond the Kitáb-i-ˆqán,
however, Bahá’u’lláh has created additional definitions or
realizations of the liqá’ in some of His other writings. They
indicate the necessity to be a sincere seeker of truth and
highlight the relationship between the individual believer and
the divinely revealed text. Please note that the following
selections of Bahá’u’lláh’s other writings do not have matching
authoritative or authorized translations at this time and are
purely provisional in nature. Bahá’u’lláh has written in a tablet
revealed in both Arabic and Persian: “…This is an epistle from

478                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Us unto whomsoever among mankind offereth up worship, that
it may enchant and draw him nigh unto the sanctified Seat of
reunion and Our presence…”21 It is important to note the
similarity and closeness between the opening verse of this tablet
and the Law˙-i-Liqá’. Both here and in the Law˙-i-Liqá’,
Bahá’u’lláh has made it possible for the reader to attain unto
the divine presence by reading and interacting with the sacred
verses with faith and sincerity. Thus, the recitation and reading
of the words of Bahá’u’lláh becomes a means by which we
attain the presence of God. Beyond reading of the text,
Bahá’u’lláh has provided another means for humanity to attain
the liqá’.

In a Persian tablet, Bahá’u’lláh affirms almost verbatim what
The Báb has written in the Persian Bayán regarding the
liqá’u’lláh: that humanity and the larger creation have not been
brought into existence save for the purpose of attaining the
presence of the Lord. What is significant about this particular
Tablet is that near its conclusion Bahá’u’lláh states that
whosoever abides by and clings unto the laws and ordinances of
God and the Kitáb-i-Aqdas will be reckoned as those who have
attained His presence.22 One may conclude, in conjunction with
this and other writings, that Bahá’u’lláh has defined the
liqá’u’lláh in the light of faithful adherence to both the sacred
text and the ordinances contained therein. Furthermore, Fá∂il
Mázandarání has quoted a brief excerpt in Persian from the
fourth volume of his Amr va Khalq where Bahá’u’lláh states
that one who is engaged in devoted service to the Faith in the
days of God will be considered as one who has attained His
presence.23 In addition to these previous passages, there is a
tablet addressed to Samandar24 where Bahá’u’lláh also speaks of
the death of the physical body and the passing away from this
earthly existence as the “gate” before attaining the presence of
God and the means by which re-union with Him is achieved.25

Additional Passages from the Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh

The selections previously quoted from the Kitáb-i-ˆqán and
the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf indicates the spiritual
authority and sovereignty inherent in each of the divine
manifestations of God. With this same spiritual, immaterial
sovereignty, the Manifestations of God may also determine and
judge if an individual human being has fulfilled and attained the
liqá’. In other tablets and writings to individual believers,
Bahá’u’lláh exercises the authority to confirm the recipients as
having fulfilled and attained unto the divine presence. For
example, in a tablet addressed to an individual named Zayn,
Bahá’u’lláh addresses him as such: “O Zayn! The friends seek the
divine presence and so doth God, magnified be His glory!…We
beseech God that He aid His chosen ones with the bounty of
forbearance, or perchance He may vouchsafe for them the
recompense of attaining His presence, He verily is the All-
Powerful, the Almighty!”26 Note the first part of this quote,
that both the believers and God desire that they should meet
Him and attain His presence; this reads very closely to the
˙adíth attributed to the sixth Imám, Ja‘far aß-Ṣádiq, quoted
earlier in this paper, that if one desires and longs for the
meeting with God, God also desires for that individual to attain
His presence.

In a tablet addressed to Aba’l-Óasan, Bahá’u’lláh lauds and
praises him for having heard and read the divine verses and
further counsels him not to be saddened by his separation from
His presence, as the Pen of the Most-Ancient has recorded
Aba’l-Óasan as having been granted the recompense of
attaining His presence.27 Likewise, in a tablet addressed to an
individual named Ra˙ím, Bahá’u’lláh offers praise and blessings
to Ra˙ím for his desire to attain the presence of “the Almighty,
the Best-Beloved,” and further counsels him to not be saddened
by his remoteness from Bahá’u’lláh, as power rests and has
rested with and will always remain in the hand of God, and that

480                                              Lights of Irfán vol. 18

should God will or desire; He will bestow the recompense of the
liqá’.28 Further to the above mentioned tablets to Zayn and
Aba’l-Óasan, there are two additional fascinating passages,
both very similar to each other, in which Bahá’u’lláh creates a
meaningful imagery of the divinely revealed verses of God as
the means by which the individual may see God, thus implying
one’s attainment to God’s presence and beholding His
appearance. In referring to the revelation of divine verses,
Bahá’u’lláh writes:

> Say: ‘O people of the earth! Equate ye not the creation
> of the verses of God with the creation of any given
> thing, nor its appearance with the appearance of other
> things, if ye understand. Verily it is, in its essence, the
> mirror of God among all of the worlds, and verily it
> recounteth God and His excellent names, and by it ye
> are verily guided unto the Straight Path. Through it, God
> hath created all that hath been and all that is to be.’29

Passages from the writings and talks of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá

The following statements from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá may be
understood as further elucidation on the liqá’, and in some
instances, confirmation or clarification of what Bahá’u’lláh has
written. The following three passages are currently published
and available in Persian, these translations are also purely
provisional.

Recall that Bahá’u’lláh defines both earnest service and
sincere investigation and belief in the sacred texts as instances
wherein human beings may attain the presence of God. The
following passages clearly re-iterate and affirm what
Bahá’u’lláh has written. Ishráq-Khávarí has published a small
excerpt in Persian from a Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, wherein He
states, “O thou who art certain of God! By liqá’ is meant belief
in the signs of God…as bodily nearness is of no import, drawing

near [unto God’s presence] is in faith and certitude….”30
‘Abdu’l-Bahá has also written in a similar passage, “…by
nearness (qurbíyyat) [to the divine presence] is meant that of
the spirit, not the body…in light of this it is hoped that you may
draw nigh [unto God’s presence] in every way.”31 Furthermore,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá also affirms Bahá’u’lláh’s statements about
service to the Cause of God as having fulfilled attainment unto
His presence, “…the reality of ‘drawing near’ [unto God] is
steadfastness in the religion of God, service to His Cause, and
offering worship to the divine court of oneness…”32

Elsewhere, we read in Foundations of World Unity:

> Praise be to God! you have heard the call of the
> Kingdom. Your eyes are opened; you have turned to
> God. Your purpose is the good-pleasure of God, the
> understanding of the mysteries of the heart and
> investigation of the realities. Day and night you must
> strive that you may attain to the significances of the
> heavenly kingdom, perceive the signs of divinity,
> acquire certainty of knowledge and realize that this
> world has a creator, a vivifier, a provider, an
> architect…In this way may you behold the presence of
> God and attain to the knowledge of the holy, divine
> Manifestations. [FWU 65]

In one of His talks delivered in New York in 1912, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá refers to the members of Mr. Kinney’s Bible class as those
who desire to approach the presence of God and subsequently
counsels them in words similar to those found in Bahá’u’lláh’s
writings: “It is my hope that you may put forth your most
earnest endeavor to accomplish this end, that you may
investigate and study the Holy Scriptures word by word so that
you may attain knowledge of the mysteries hidden therein. Be
not satisfied with words, but seek to understand the spiritual
meanings hidden in the heart of the words…” [PUP 459]. It is
evident from the above passages that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá clearly

482                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

confirms and in some instances offers some clarification on the
meaning behind the liqá’.

Kawthar and Liqá’

A similar interpretative mechanism has been applied to other
concepts and constructs in the Bahá’í writings. We will provide
one example of an Islamic metaphysical construct employed in
the writings of The Báb. In one of the major works of The Báb,
the Commentary on the Súrih of Kawthar (Tafsír Súriyih
Kawthar), written for Siyyid Ya˙yá Dárábí (later designated as
the Letter of the Living, Va˙íd), He identifies the revelation of
divine verses from His pen, just as Bahá’u’lláh identifies the
divine verses of His pen as a means to attain the presence of
God, as the flowing waters from the fountain of kawthar in
paradise. In one of the passages of this work provisionally
translated and quoted by Dr. Nader Saiedi we read:

> The waters of that river [from the Kawthar fountain in
> paradise] flow forth from my tongue and pen with that
> which God willeth, imperishable and everlasting…33

The Báb, as the Manifestation of God invested with divine
authority and sovereignty (in this case, to reveal divine verses),
has defined this concept of Kawthar, rather than being an
abstract physical location attainable only in the realms of
Paradise, instead being found and attained in reading the
divinely revealed word of God.

Notes on the content of the Law˙-i-Liqá’

Although, as previously mentioned, the recipients of the
Law˙-i-Liqá’ are not known at this time, Bahá’u’lláh uses
specific language to qualify and describe them. They are called
“the birds of the most exalted paradise” (a†yáru’l Firdaws).
“Firdaws” is a term found in the Qur’án, the highest attainable
realm of paradise where the Prophet Mu˙ammad and other

prophets and messengers of God, martyrs, saints, and the pious
dwell. One may infer that Bahá’u’lláh’s intent in using this
phrase is to indicate that because the recipients have attained a
stage in their spiritual growth and search for divine truth, they
are symbolically dwelling in such a lofty station. This is further
indicated in the same passage when Bahá’u’lláh acknowledges
them for their acceptance of His Cause and that the
“Concourse on high” has rejoiced because of their belief. It is
therefore possible that they may have been recent or new
believers to the faith of Bahá’u’lláh who desired to meet Him
and be in His presence. Afterwards, Bahá’u’lláh mentions that
simultaneously, the denizens of the cities of eternity have raised
their cries of grief and lamentation owing to their “burning
thirst” despite their nearness to the ocean of His presence.
Although it is not explicitly stated, it is possible that
Bahá’u’lláh is referring to a recent exile [perhaps to ‘Akká]
because these recipients did not get to see Him beforehand. He
has therefore written this Tablet as a means of attaining His
presence. When reading this passage, it seems that Bahá’u’lláh
has eliminated this dichotomy between joy and anguish. After
mentioning these two phenomena, Bahá’u’lláh writes that they
have become one or entwined in the Day of God.

We read near the middle section of the Tablet that
Bahá’u’lláh offers blessings and praise for these recipients for
having entered “the city.” The language itself is at once both
simple to follow, yet, also ambiguous. The word for “city” in
Arabic is “madínah,” and this term has a diverse meaning in the
writings of Bahá’u’lláh. In one instance, it can refer to a literal
town, city, or place where the Manifestation of God is
dwelling, and in the other, it is highly figurative by referring to
stages of spiritual progress of the individual. In this particular
connection, it is interesting that Bahá’u’lláh makes reference to
the “city of eternal and immortal life” in His discourse and
interpretation of the liqá’ in the Kitáb-i-ˆqán, as well as in in
this Tablet, where He writes that the recipients of the Law˙-i-

484                                           Lights of Irfán vol. 18

Liqá’ are blessed for having entered “the city.” Perhaps
Bahá’u’lláh is invoking the same city He mentioned in the ˆqán.

Conclusion

The Law˙-i-Liqá’ and other passages from the writings
of Bahá’u’lláh bring about a figurative and meaningful under-
standing of what it means for humanity to attain the divine
presence. Whereas in previous religious dispensations this idea
and others were and still are understood to be literal and
physical events that have yet to occur, Bahá’u’lláh confirms
that the presence of God will be attained and realized in
multiple instances including being in the physical presence of
His manifestations, reading the divinely revealed texts with
sincerity, and carrying out acts of service with utmost
detachment and purity of motive.

Bahá’u’lláh’s “ Law˙-i-Liqá’,” or “The Tablet
of the Divine Presence”

1\. First translation, published in 1928

For the reference and use of the reader, the text of the first
published translation of the Law˙-i-Liqá’ will be provided
below. It is not known who carried out this translation; it is
included in the Bahá’í Scriptures compilation published in 1928,
within the chapter entitled, “The Degrees of Devotion.” The

> The one who reads that which is revealed in this Tablet

> O birds of Paradise! Hear the voice of the Beloved in

> On account of your advancement the Supreme

> This is indeed good; that this rejoicing and sorrow seem

> The bellies of the polytheists are burned by that which
