                   Tablet of Consolation (Lawḥ-i ta`ziya)

Revealed by Bahā’u’llāh

Introduction and provisional translation by Joshua Hall

This letter, or tablet, was composed by Bahá’u’lláh following the death of the father of
one of the believers. In it, Bahá’u’lláh consoles the deceased’s son by assuring him that
his father has ascended to God and attained “a station that the pen of the worlds is
powerless to describe”. He commiserates with the son’s loss, by relating the death of His
own father when Bahá’u’lláh was at a young age. Bahá’u’lláh admonishes the son not to
grieve, but to take solace in God and to be heartened by the divine consolation found in
the tablet.

The central message here is that death is not to be a cause of grief but, rather, should be
recognized as a transition in the journey of drawing ever nearer to God. Baha’u’llah also
says that God is above all limitation and therefore the true source of comfort and solace.

Tablet of Consolation

J.
God consoles you as a token of His grace, and He is, in truth, the Comforter, the All-
Knowing, the All-Wise. Do not be sorrowful on account of your father. He has ascended
to God and from him the perfume of My cherished love is diffused. It is for one that is
heedless that you ought to grieve, not for one who has attained to the remembrance of
Me, the All-Wise.

God forgave him before his ascension and, after his departing, He caused him to enter a
station that the pen of the worlds is powerless to describe.

Convey My greetings to the one named Ali. Say: Beware lest you be sorrowful in My
days or that anything should perturb you. Look upon the ocean of the loving kindness of
your Lord and be among them that rejoice.

I was younger than you upon the passing of My father, and I had the comfort of some of
His servants. Yet you have the consolation of God by His own tongue, the Holy, the
Cherished, the Wondrous. Be just: is it befitting that one should mourn after this? No, I
swear by My beauty that shines in effulgence from this manifest horizon! This is an
address that We have revealed lest you should be grieved by anything that might come to

pass on earth. In truth, your Lord is the Expounder, the All-Knowing.

This is not the day of grief and weeping. Rather, it is befitting that you and the believers
should rejoice in the days of your Lord, the Forgiving, the Compassionate.

He is sufficient unto you in truth, and more loving is He than a thousand fathers. Even
this sentiment, however, is within the limitation of this world1. Otherwise, He Himself is
far above His attributes being constrained by any bound or circumscribed by the pen and
ink. All possessed of discerning knowledge testify to this.

Trust in Him and immerse yourself in His praise. Be gladdened, moreover, that He
should make mention of you in this, His Most Great Prison, with verses that all the
treasures of the universe could not surpass.

Blessed is the one who ascended. He is indeed among them that have been guided by the
light of Revelation and who turned unto the Beloved with a radiant visage. Out of his
goodwill have you come into being and arisen in the service of Him who is your Lord,
the Ancient of Days. Remember him with joy and gladness as We remember him in this
glorious vision. Upon him be the glory of God and the glory of those in My kingdom, as
well as every beauteous praise.

From La'ali'u'l-Hikma Volume Three, Passage 78
