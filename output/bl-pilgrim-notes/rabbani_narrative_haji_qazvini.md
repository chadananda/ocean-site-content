Translator’s Foreword

One of the most severely tried and steadfast figures of Bábí and
Bahá’í early history is a merchant from Qazvin by the name of Hájí
Nasír. This unassuming champion of the Cause of the Báb and
Bahá’u’lláh led a most remarkable life, which will be briefly outlined
in this monograph, and his fascinating account of the events of
Shaykh Tabarsí offered in translation will occupy the main part of
this monograph. The original text of the same account will also be
given in an appendix to facilitate the study of this important and
rare manuscript. In addition, a section is offered outlining the
primary source documents on the battle of Shaykh Tabarsí, and an
appendix is added that provides a non-Bábí account of the event,
translated by Habib Borjian.

I wish to thank Ivan Lloyd for granting permission to use his
drawing on the cover page, Dr. Moojan Momen for bringing to my
attention several important sources for biography of Hájí Nasír and
Steve Cooney for sharing a copy of Prof Borjian’s paper. My most
heartfelt gratitude goes to my dear collaborator Phillip Tussing,
who, as in so many previous projects, read through the entire
manuscript and offered many critical suggestions for its
improvement. A truer friend is hard to imagine.

As always, I remain solely responsible for any errors or
shortcomings in the present monograph.

Hájí Nasír Qazvíní: A Short Biography

Hájí Nasír, or more fully, Hájí Muhammad-Nasír Táb-Tharáh1, was
born and raised in Qazvin, in the north-western part of Iran. He was
an affluent merchant of good repute. He embraced the Bábí
movement in the early years of the religion through fervent
discussions and the teaching of Akhúnd Mullá Jalíl Urúmí, one of
the Letters of the Living. Fádil Mázandarání reports that when Hájí
Nasír had acknowledged the claims of the Báb, Mullá Jalíl warned
him that a mere acknowledgement was not sufficient:

> O Hájí! Beware that in this wondrous Cause testimony is
> not sufficient through speech and belief is not entrusted
> to the tongue. The sign of faith is the willingness to be
> sacrificed and radiant acquiescence in martyrdom in
> God’s path. You cannot claim to be a Bábí unless you
> reach the ultimate stage of detachment from personal
welfare, material comforts and family life.

Now return to your home and in solitude reflect
> on this for a while: When the hour has come to arise and
> render victorious the Beloved of the World, and a large
> multitude have arisen to confiscate your possessions,
> take your wife, slay your children and offer you the
> choice between recantation and freedom, or confession
> of faith and suffering, under such a condition, if you
> have the resolve to endure all of these afflictions and
> remain constant in the Cause, only then you are worthy
> to be considered a Bábí. Otherwise, all is lost.2

\[1\] Often the title of a person who becomes affluent through a goodly character
and positive business practices.

\[2\] Fádil Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 3, pp. 380-81. The same
passage is quoted in Muhammad-‘Alí Malik-Khusraví, Táríkh Shuhadáy Amr,

Hájí Nasír responded to the stern counsel of Mullá Jalíl by
devoting that entire night to meditation and reflection. At the hour
of dawn, he felt overcome with such detachment and certitude as to
be ready to sacrifice his life in the path of God and his new-found
Faith. With utmost joy and resignation, that morning he went to
Mullá Jalíl and was enrolled as one of the Bábí believers.

As a new devotee, his singular desire was to attain the
presence of the Báb. The following recollection of such a visit is
reported:

> When His Holiness the Most Great Remembrance [the
> Báb] was being conveyed to Adharbayjan, I left Qazvin
> after Him in order to attain His blessed presence. At
> every station I reached, the governmental soldiers had
> taken that Wronged One to the next station. Therefore,
> I increased the pace of my search and eagerly reached
> my goal. I gave some gratuity to the soldiers who
> allowed me to enter the room where His Holiness was
staying.

I greeted Him and expressed my respect. He
> granted me permission to sit. I sat. He was drinking tea,
> and because of the consideration of wisdom and the
> soldiers’ attitude, He was cautious and did not utter a
> word. I was lost in the wonder of His beauty and His
majestic splendor.

I was gazing at His half-finished cup of tea and
> entertained the wish to have the bounty of drinking
> from that cup. At that instant, He motioned me to drink
> from the same cup. He also gestured to me to return to
> Qazvin.

vol. 2, p. 233, where it is attributed to a memoir penned by Hájí Nasír’s son,
Áqá ‘Alí Arbáb.

Therefore, with a heart filled with sadness and a
> mind agitated by the deeds of the wrong-doers, I
> returned to Qazvin.3

Soon persecutions engulfed Hájí Nasír and proved the
wisdom of Mullá Jalíl’s consul. The first incident was in relation to
the murder of Mullá Taqí Baraghání in Qazvin in October 1847 by a
young Shaykhí, most likely assisted by two others. Since the
powerful Baraghání was known for his anti-Shaykhí and anti-Bábí
stance, soon, the Bábís were falsely accused of this crime. Several
Babis were martyred, the first recorded instance of the killing of
Bábís in Iran. Hájí Nasír also became the target of attacks by an
incited mob that plundered his possessions, forced him to go into
hiding in Qazvin, and eventually to leave his native town for a
period of time in favor of Gilanat in the province of Gilan. When
the situation had calmed he returned to his residence.

It must have been about this time that a Tablet was revealed
by the Báb in Hájí Nasír’s honor which began with the words, Huva
al-Nasr al-Nasr.4

In 1847, in obedience to the call of the Báb, Who urged all the
Bábís to hasten to Khurasan in support of the teaching activities of
Quddús and Mullá Husayn in Mashhad, he proceeded to that town.
It was then that Hájí Nasír came to understand the spiritual station
of Quddús, the “hidden treasure” that the Báb had promised.5 It is
recorded on his behalf:

> Early in the Cause, I had deep devotion and a profound
> belief in the honored Bábu’l-Báb6, as he was the courier

Muhammad-‘Alí Malik-Khusravi, Táríkh Shuhadáy Amr, vol. 2, pp. 234-35,
where it is attributed to an account by Nasiroff.

of divine knowledge, the first to believe [in the Báb], the
> first Letter of the Living and the gate to His Holiness
the Báb [the Gate].

After a few days, however, I noticed that in a
> gathering of the companions, it was His Holiness
> Quddús who was seated at the place of honor while all
> others stood reverently in his presence. That honored
> personage [Mullá Husayn] was also standing in his
> presence with the utmost respect with hands folded over
> chest while waves of divine verses and wondrous
> utterances poured forth from the pearl-dispensing lips of
Quddús.

It was then that I understood that another mighty
power and resplendent effulgence had appeared.7

Hájí Nasír was present in Mashhad when a fight took place
between a young Bábí and an attendant of one of the local mujtahids.
According to Hasan Fú’ádí’s narrative, the Bábí involved was beaten
and dragged through the town by a rope through his nose. On
hearing this, seventy Bábís gathered in the house of Bábíyyih,
attempted to rescue him with their ready swords, and in the ensuing
clash that occurred a few Mashhadís and Bábís were injured.8 This
incident led to Mullá Husayn’s expulsion from Mashhad and his
journey to Mazandaran. Instead of traveling with Mullá Husayn, it
appears that Hájí Nasír journeyed with Quddús, since we find him
attending the conference of Badasht in late June 1848, where he
acted as a gatekeeper at the entrance to one of the gardens.9

also Nabíl Zarandí, The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 288–89.

\[9\] Fadíl Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 3, pp. 381, suggests Hájí Nasír
was a guard at the garden reserved for Bahá’u’lláh. Muhammad-‘Alí Malik-
Khusraví, Táríkh Shuhadáy Amr, vol. 2, pp. 235-36, indicates that he served by
the building used by Quddús.

At the conclusion of this gathering, he accompanied
Bahá’u’lláh as far as Niyala, a village in Mazandaran. The villagers,
however, attacked the Bábís, killed and injured some, and plundered
their belongings.

After rejoining Mullá Husayn’s march, when they reached the
village of Arim, near Savád-Kúh, Hájí Nasír became gravely ill. A
traveling companion, Lutf-‘Alí Mírzá Shírází, looked after him and
nursed him back to health. After regaining his strength, he
continued with the journey, and in Mazandaran he was one of the
ablest defenders at the fortress of Shaykh Tabarsí.

Hájí Nasír rendered remarkable services during the battles of
Shaykh Tabarsí, which commenced in September 1848 and
concluded in May 1849, and as we will see later in these pages, has
recorded a poignant account of that incident. During a portion of
these events, his attendant, Hájí Ismá‘íl served as well.10

Towards the concluding days of the confrontations at Shaykh
Tabarsí, the supply of provisions that the Bábís had stored was
completely depleted. The following is recorded in Hájí Nasír’s
recollections as a token of his devotion to his master, Quddús:

> During the extreme days of the encirclement of the Fort
> in Mazandaran when the companions were suffering
> bitterly from the absence of food, one day I looked
> through my bag and travel sack and found a single
> almond. Even though I had been suffering from
> starvation for some time to the point that all strength
> had abandoned me, instantly I knew that I should take
> that almond to the illustrious Quddús. Therefore, I
> wrapped that single almond in a piece of silk and
> presented it before him.11

\[10\] Muhammad-‘Alí Malik-Khusraví, Táríkh Shuhadáy Amr, vol. 2, p. 244,
suggests Hájí Ismá‘íl was sent to Tehran to purchase certain items and
nothing was ever heard of him again. Either he suffered martyrdom or
disappeared for some other reason.

\[11\] Fádil Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 3, pp. 382.

According to Fádil Mazandarání, who must have had access to
Nabil’s narrative12, the following is recorded in Nabíl Zarandí’s
account pertaining to the same period of acute food shortage at the
Fort:

> During the time that no food was left in the Fort, a cow
> had remained. The honored Hájí Nasír, who was a
> brilliant star of the Faith over the horizon of Qazvin,
> would prepare her milk for the Countenance of the
> Friend13, who would partake of a few small spoonfuls
> and send the rest to the companions, who each would
> drink a spoonful.14

The following is also recorded by Shaykh Kázim Samandar in
his fascinating and important (and unfortunately as yet untranslated)
Táríkh Samandar:

\[13\] Tal‘at Habíb, a title of Quddús.

\[14\] Fádil Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 3, pp. 382.

The late Hájí Nasír Táb-Tharáh knew a great many
episodes [of Bábí or Bahá’í history] and had many
recollections, as he had observed uncountable events.
He had recorded most of them in his own hand. So far I
have not been successful in locating a copy, but, by the
Divine grace, I cherish the hope that they will be
located. The most trustworthy details of Mazandaran
have all been recorded in that narrative.

A story was heard from the late Hájí Nasír Táb-
Tharáh himself, of which there is no doubt, since many
others heard the same details and they are currently
available.

The detail is that when a wound had come to the
mouth of His Holiness Quddús – upon whom rest the
Glory of God, the Most Glorious, and may his
remembrance be exalted above all others – then Hájí
Nasír presented him with a silk handkerchief to either
wipe away [the blood] or to close the wound.

When presenting this, uncontrollably, he made a
sigh. His Holiness inquired, “For what reason do you
sigh?” The Hájí was embarrassed and did not respond.
His Holiness insisted, to which it was responded, “When
I was a merchant, among the items that I traded were
such silk handkerchiefs. When I saw it again, without
wanting to, I was reminded of that time and had that
[sad] condition.” The honored Quddús responded, “You
will once again trade in them.”

The esteemed Hájí Nasír used to say, “I was most
puzzled by this utterance since our Fort was encircled by
the enemy and we were engulfed in the most hopeless
and grave situation.”

Nevertheless, truly because of the influence of
> Quddús’ blessed utterance, for many years [after this]
> Hájí [Nasír] worked as a merchant.15

As recorded in various narratives by both the Bábí and
Muslim chroniclers, in order to bring a conclusion to the standoff at
Shaykh Tabarsí, the commanding officer, Mihdí-Qulí Mírzá, pledged
a truce on the Qur’án, and the Bábís, by reason of their respect for
the Holy Book, came out of the Fort. The besiegers were housed in
a field known as Dazvá Maydán, which apparently was next to the
military camp.16 Hájí Nasír continued in the company of Quddús,
and the next morning, 17 Jamádíu’th-Thání 1265 AH [10 May
1849], when all the Bábís went from Dazvá to the military camp and
were summarily arrested, he was imprisoned as well.

Soon a majority of the Bábís were executed, but Mírzá Báqir
Qazvíní, who was the Prince Governor’s Farrash-Báshí, recognized

\[15\] Cited in Muhammad-‘Alí Malik-Khusraví, Táríkh Shuhadáy Amr, vol. 2, pp.

236-37.

Hájí Nasír and Hájí ‘Abdu’l-Majíd Nayshabúrí17 from previous
associations, and perhaps based on the fact that Mírzá Báqir and
Hájí Nasír were from the same town. He pulled them aside and
suggested that through the payment of a ransom, they could be
freed. They agreed, and the Farrash-Bashí asked the Prince Mihdí-
Qulí Mírzá for the pardon of these two men, which was granted.18

When the Fort was demolished, Hájí Nasír and a few others,
together with Quddús, were conducted with tied hands to Babul, a
small town known at that time as Barfurush. After Quddús and
others were martyred most savagely, and Mihdí-Qulí Mírzá had
departed for Sari, the seat of his government, Mírzá Báqir brought
Hájí Nasír and Hájí ‘Abdu’l-Majíd Nayshabúrí to Tehran in order to
exact from them the promised sum. They were first imprisoned
pending the payment of their ransom. While in prison, Hájí ‘Abdu’l-
Majíd arranged with someone, most likely one of the jailers, to let
them escape for 100 tumans each. Once the deal was finalized, Hájí
Nasír thought the sum was too extravagant and refused to pay. Hájí
‘Abdu’l-Majíd paid and escaped at night.

Since Hájí Nasír had no one in Tehran to lend him the
required ransom or vouch for him, Mírzá Báqir took him to Qazvin

\[17\] He is better know as the father of the celebrated Badí‘, who carried
Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet to the Sultan of Iran and suffered martyrdom as result of
it. The father, too, was martyred at an advanced age, and the story is told in
the forthcoming The Voice of the Heroes, translation of Hasan Fú’ádí’s Táríkh
Amrí Khurasan.

\[18\] Muhammad-‘Alí Malik-Khusravi, Táríkh Shuhadáy Amr, vol. 2, pp. 237-38.

Malik-Khusravi notes that his statement is in slight conflict with Nabíl’s,
which is as follows: “As soon as these atrocities hath been perpetrated, the
prince ordered those who had been retained as captives to be ushered, one
after another, into his presence. Those among them who were men of
recognized standing, such as the father of Badí‘, Mullá Mírzá Muhammad-i-
Furughi, and Hájí Nasír-i-Qazvini, he charged his attendants to conduct to
Tihran and obtain in return for their deliverance a ransom from each one of
them in direct proportion to their capacity and wealth. As to the rest, he gave
orders to his executioners that they be immediately put to death.” (The Dawn-
Breakers, p. 404)

and incarcerated him in the governmental prison. Eventually, Hájí
Nasír paid a sum of 500 tumans and regained his freedom.19

He soon gathered sufficient funds to resume his profession,
continuing to focus on trading silk in Qazvin and Lahijan. It is
reported that he was peerless in trustworthiness, equity and
reliability as a merchant, and these qualities served him well in his
occupation and in the conduct of business. Samandar reports that
he heard one of the antagonists say, “People say Hájí Nasír is an
infidel. However, no one accuses him of being untrustworthy or
irreligious.”20

Shortly after that, however, another upheaval engulfed the
Bábís. The ill-conceived attempt on the life of Násiri’d-Dín Sháh in
1852 unleashed a wave of pogroms against the Bábí community.
Recognized as a leading figure of the reform movement, Hájí Nasír
was arrested in Qazvin by its governor, Khusraw Khán, and put in
prison. The news of his imprisonment made the national news
organ known as Waqáyi’í Ittifáqiyya21, number 82, Thursday, 29
Dhi’l-Hajjih 1268 AH [14 October 1852]:

> According to reports appearing in Qazvin’s newspaper, a

seized and imprisoned by Khusraw Khán, the governor
of Qazvin.22

It was only through expenditure of a sum of money that he
was able to obtain his release. This incident, though, robbed him of
most of his capital.23

When Bahá’u’lláh was in Adrianople, the news of the
opposition of Mírzá Yahyá Azal, the nominal head of the Bábí
community, reached Hájí Nasír. For some time he tried to unravel
this complicated situation and to discover the station of Bahá’u’lláh
and the role of Azal in the post-Báb period. Unsuccessful in
obtaining much insight, he wrote Bahá’u’lláh requesting clarification
on Mírzá Yahyá Azal’s status.

The response by Bahá’u’lláh is a significant and long Tablet
known as the Lawh Nasír.24 Most of this Tablet is in exquisite
Persian, and a small portion of this text was translated by Shoghi
Effendi and included in Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh,
sections LIII and LXXV.

It is in this Tablet that Bahá’u’lláh throws light on the
historical circumstances that led to the appointment of Mírzá Yahyá
Azal by the Báb as the leader of the Bábí community, and mentions
that only two individuals, Mírzá Músá, known as Áqá Kalím, and
Mullá ‘Abdu’l-Karím Qazvíní, were informed of the details of this
appointment. He condemns Azal’s treacherous deeds, his attempt to
assassinate Bahá’u’lláh, and his shameful accusations attributing his
own crimes to Him.

A considerable portion of this Tablet is addressed to the Bábís
of Iran who had not yet come to recognize Bahá’u’lláh, who are
referred to as “the people of the Bayán.” Bahá’u’lláh reminds them

of various statements of the Báb concerning the exalted station of
the One who was to appear after Him.

Bahá’u’lláh then states the following words in the same Tablet
to Hájí Nasír, regarding the station of those who have recognized
Him:

> O Nasír, O My Servant! God, the Eternal Truth, beareth Me
> witness. The Celestial Youth hath, in this Day, raised above the
> heads of men the glorious Chalice of Immortality, and is standing
> expectant upon His seat, wondering what eye will recognize His
> glory, and what arm will, unhesitatingly, be stretched forth to seize
> the Cup from His snow-white Hand and drain it. Only a few
> have as yet quaffed from this peerless, this soft-flowing grace of the
> Ancient King. These occupy the loftiest mansions of Paradise, and
> are firmly established upon the seats of authority. By the
> righteousness of God! Neither the mirrors of His glory, nor the
> revealers of His names, nor any created thing, that hath been or
> will ever be, can ever excel them, if ye be of them that comprehend
this truth.

O Nasír! The excellence of this Day is immensely exalted
> above the comprehension of men, however extensive their
> knowledge, however profound their understanding. How much
> more must it transcend the imaginations of them that have strayed
> from its light, and been shut out from its glory! Shouldst thou rend
> asunder the grievous veil that blindeth thy vision, thou wouldst
> behold such a bounty as naught, from the beginning that hath no
> beginning till the end that hath no end, can either resemble or

> choose to speak, so that they who are shut out as by a veil from
> Him can recognize His glory? The righteous, inmates of the
> Kingdom on high, shall drink deep from the Wine of Holiness, in

On studying this Tablet, Hájí Nasír and his entire family
became believers in Bahá’u’lláh.27

Hájí Nasír was imprisoned yet another time, under peculiar
circumstances that he describes himself – see the concluding section
of his narrative. As described by his lifelong friend, Shaykh Kázim
Samandar, he had left for Gilan when he was seized only one station
out of Qazvin, and conducted to Tehran, where he was put in
chains and fetters.28 When released from his ordeal, he found that all
his considerable possessions were confiscated yet again.29

It was through the assistance of Shaykh Kázim Samandar, a
renowned early follower of Bahá’u’lláh, that Hájí Nasír was able to
resume his profession of trading in silk moth cocoons and silk. In
the process, he moved his residence to the city of Rasht, and
established the nucleus of the first Bahá’í’ community there –
perhaps one of the earliest instances of “pioneering” in the recorded
history of the young religion. Though several of this family were
Bahá’ís and known in the city as such, no one from Rasht embraced
the Faith.30

Some time later, due to an epidemic, the caterpillars did not
produce sufficient cocoons, the silk trade collapsed, and soon the
local economy in the province of Gilan was impacted. His business

partners refused payments on various drafts and Hájí Nasír was
bankrupt, lost his plantations and other properties in Qazvin, and
even his main residence. All that was left to him was 100 tumans.
Once more, Samandar came to his aid and placed him at the head of
his trading office in Rasht.31

About that time, in 1874, an opportunity presented itself for
him to journey to ‘Akká and to attain the presence of Bahá’u’lláh.
On this pilgrimage he was accompanied by Shaykh Kázim
Samandar. Bahá’u’lláh welcomed this old friend of Badasht days
with great affection and showered upon him immense kindness.
Samandar reports that one day Bahá’u’lláh, Who was staying in the
house of Áqá Kalím at the Khán Jurayni,32 addressed Hájí Nasír:

> Jináb Hájí! You have toiled much and suffered much in
> the path of God. If you yourself have forgotten what
> you have done and endured, God has not. But the
> worlds of God are not confined to this world. Were it so
> the Exalted Prophets would not have consented to bear

> and martyred with volleys of malice and malignity; and I
> would not have consented to be dragged, bare-headed
> and barefooted, in utmost degradation, from Niyávarán
> to Tehran to bear untold blows.

Samandar states further, “In brief, He expounded this theme
in most excellent words. He was telling the Hájí that he will be
recompensed in the worlds to come.”33

Moreover, Shaykh Kázim reports that Bahá’u’lláh
confidentially hinted to him to be sure to look after Hájí Nasír.34

On his return, he continued to live in Rasht with his family,
and spent the latter part of his life in that city engaged in
propagating the Bahá’í Faith to those who were interested. He was
assisted in his trading business by his two sons.

In 1882, another intense persecution was unleashed, this time
by Kamrán Mírzá, the governor of Tehran. A number of Bahá’ís in
various towns, particularly Tehran, were imprisoned and some
tortured. Soon this spread to Rasht also. According to Ustád
‘Abdu’l-Karím Yazdí, the following believers were imprisoned in
Rasht:35

> 1.    Hájí Nasír Qazvíní
> 2.    Áqá ‘Alí Arbáb, eldest son of Hájí Nasír Qazvíní
> 3.    Áqá Mírzá Mihdí Ja‘farzadih Rashtí
> 4.    Mullá Yúsuf-‘Alí Rashtí
> 5.    Áqá Mírzá Báqir Bassár Rashtí
> 6.    Áqá ‘Alí-Asghar ‘Attár, brother of Bassár
> 7.    Mashhadí ‘Alí, another brother of Bassár
> 8.    Áqá Javád ‘Attár Rashtí
> 9.    Áqá Rasul Tájir [“merchant”] Rashtí
> 10.   Ustád Ismá‘íl Kalúchih-paz
> 11.   Áqá Muhammad-Ismá‘íl Sabbágh Qazvíní
> 12.   Ustád Ibrahím Kalúchih-paz
> 13.   Áqá Muhammad-Ibráhím Sabbágh Qazvíní

After these Bahá’ís were incarcerated, a remarkable act,
unheard of in Qajar Iran, took place: Three more Bahá’ís went to
the authorities demanding, “Either release these men or place us in
chains too.” The governor arrested and imprisoned them as well.
These three brave believers were:

15.    Áqá Siyyid Mihdí Dervish

The situation for the Bahá’ís worsened when three days later
arrests were made in Lahijan as well. Three more well-known
Bahá’ís were seized and imprisoned:

> 17.    Áqá Muhammad-Sádiq Kuláh-Dúz Qazvíní
> 18.    Mírzá ‘Alí Ashraf, known as the poet ‘Andalíb
> 19.    Karbalá’í Bábá Vakíl Láhijání

Some of the above-mentioned believers were released after
some time – numbers 10, 11, 12, 13 and 19 on the above list.36
Others remained in prison for a long and difficult time.

Hájí Nasír could not endure the rigors of prison life and, after
so many years of toil and suffering, died a martyr’s death after forty
days in the prison.37 Several porters carried his body to his residence.

When the news of Hájí Nasír’s death reached the incited mob,
a number of ruffians forced their way into his house and attempted
to dismember his remains. With horror and consternation, his
family stood helplessly watching the cruel atrocities perpetrated by
heartless fanatics. They had Hájí Nasír’s nose and ears cut off, his
eyes gouged out, pulled out his beard and were about to set the
house on fire when they were stopped by the landlord, who was a
Russian citizen and had appealed to the Russian Consulate for
protection.

Several farrashes carried the remains of Hájí Nasír outside the
town, threw them into a disused brick furnace by a river known as

remaining prisoners insisted on being Bahá’ís, and as such remained in prison.
This appears to suggest that that five released believers were coerced into
recantation, which would have resulted in their release.

Kuláhsih Rúdbár and covered them with earth. Some time later, his
son, Áqá ‘Alí Arbáb purchased that parcel of land and built a
structure over it that serves as Hájí Nasír’s monument.

Several years after his martyrdom, in 1891, Bahá’u’lláh paid a
glowing tribute to Hájí Nasír for his steadfastness in the Cause of
God in Epistle to the Son of the Wolf in these words:

> Previous to these forty years controversies and conflicts continually
> prevailed and agitated the servants of God. But since then, aided
> by the hosts of wisdom, of utterance, of exhortations and
> understanding, they have all seized and taken fast hold of the firm
> cord of patience and of the shining hem of fortitude, in such wise
> that this wronged people endured steadfastly whatever befell them,
> and committed everything unto God, and this notwithstanding that
> in Mazindaran and at Rasht a great many have been most
> hideously tormented. Among them was his honor, Hájí Nasír,
> who, unquestionably, was a brilliant light that shone forth above
> the horizon of resignation. After he had suffered martyrdom, they
> plucked out his eyes and cut off his nose, and inflicted on him such
> indignities that strangers wept and lamented, and secretly raised
> funds to support his wife and children.38

As a sign of remembrance of Hájí Nasír, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
composed a Tablet of Visitation for him, and for another believer,
Karbalá’í Háshim, whose remains had been exhumed and set on
fire. The opening portion of this Visitation Tablet is quoted by
Ishraq-Khavari in Kitáb Muhádirát, page 216.

An Overview of Sources for the Study of

Shaykh Tabarsí

During the five-year period of 1848-53, on at least seven separate
occasions, the Bábís of Iran were forced to take up arms against the
Qajar state, often resulting in battles with the combined military and
militia forces of the government. These events, coupled with the
martyrdom of the Báb and most of the Letters of the Living, left
that community almost completely destroyed, with only a small
band of remnant believers left either in isolation, or in exile or in
small disjointed groups. While these occurrences have been
explored to some extent in well-known histories of the Bábís in
English language, such as, The Dawn-Breakers, or Táríkh Jadíd, or
Resurrection and Renewal, it is only recently that the various eyewitness
accounts of these events are gradually coming to the notice of
students of this period.

The first of these events occurred in Shaykh Tabarsí in 1848-
49\. The second and the third incident were led by Siyyid Yahyá
[Vahid] Dárábí, and took place in Yazd and Nayriz during the first
half of 1850. The fourth armed clash was in Zanjan, and led by
Mullá Muhammad-‘Alí [Hujjat] Zanjání. The fifth episode was in
Tehran in 1852, resulting in Bahá’u’lláh’s imprisonment and the
slaughter of many Babis of that town. The sixth uprising was
orchestrated by Mirza Yahya Azal in Mazandaran in 1853, and the
seventh known uprising against the authorities was undertaken by
the Babis of Nayriz in 1853 as well.

The key documents pertaining to the first event will be
discussed below, while the various accounts pertaining to the Yazd
and the two Nayriz events are translated and analyzed by the present

writer in a separate volume.39 Narratives regarding Zanjan have been
analyzed by John Walbridge.40 No eyewitness evidences have so far
been made available in English pertaining to Tehran or Azal’s
uprisings.

The present monograph introduces and offers in translation
(and also the original Persian) an eyewitness account of a Shaykh
Tabarsí survivor. It is hoped that this volume will shortly be
followed by monographs on two other remaining Bábí eyewitness
accounts of the same event.

Sources for Study of Shaykh Tabarsí Conflict
Of the seven major incidents in Bábí history in which armed clashes
occurred between the Bábís and governmental forces, there are
more documentary materials available for Shaykh Tabarsí than
others. These include eyewitness accounts and secondary sources,
by both Bábí-Bahá’í and Muslim writers. In addition, there are
western diplomatic sources which shed considerable light on this
episode, though discussion of them is beyond the scope of the
present study.41

The more important sources in the Persian language for
Shaykh Tabarsí can be divided into the following groups:42

Eyewitness Bábí Narratives
Among the most important documents for this event are the
eyewitness accounts written by three Bábí participants, who wrote
their recollections independently of one another and at different
times. Each of these chronicles has its own characteristics and offers
a slightly different perspective. These accounts not only provide
considerable firsthand details about the event, but also outline the
general Bábí outlook and perceptions. They are briefly introduced
below in their chronological order:

Narrative of Lutf-‘Alí Mírzá Shírází: The author was related to the
Qajar royal family through the children of Husayn-‘Alí Farmán-
Farmá, the governor of Fars.43 It is not known when he became a
Bábí, though according to his account, he joined Mullá Husayn and
his march on 12 Ramadan 1264 AH [12 August 1848] near the
boarder of Mazandaran in the village of Dih-Mullá. He was present
throughout the Shaykh Tabarsí episode, survived the ordeal and
eventually died a martyr’s death in August 1852 in Tehran, during
the pogrom unleashed after the Bábí attempt on the life of Nasiri’d-
Din Shah.

His account covers in considerable detail events from the time
that he joined the march until early April 1849, when the besiegers
were suffering intense famine at the Fort about a month before the
conclusion of the episode on 9 May 1849. According to a well-
informed historian, Lutf-‘Alí Mírzá was composing his account in
Tehran when his martyrdom prevented completion of this task.44

This untitled narrative is almost certainly the earliest and the
most extensive of the Bábí accounts, and even though the text itself
does not bear the author’s name, another early account, known as
Táríkh Mímiyyih, identifies the author and occasionally cites this

\[43\] Abú’l-Qásim Afnán, ‘Ahd-A‘lá, p. 475. Earlier Bahá’í historians (such as,
Fadil Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhuru’l-Haqq, vol. 3, p. 267) have incorrectly
identified him as an Afshar Prince.

narrative, which indicates that the text was in limited circulation
among the surviving Bábís and early Bahá’ís.45

Three copies of this narrative are in possession of the present
translator, who will shortly make his translation available:
a.      A copy transcribed by Muhammad-Báqir Tihrání

> in 1319 AH [1901-02]. At the beginning of this

Narrative of Hájí Nasír Qazvíní: The eyewitness account of Hájí
Nasír is shorter than the other two eyewitness accounts. From
internal evidences it appears to have been written well after the
events and as part of a larger autobiography, which is no longer
extant. This text was published in the first printing of Táríkh

\[45\] Siyamak Zabihi-Mughaddam, Váq‘ih Qal‘ih Shaykh Tabarsí, Germany: ‘Asr-i-
Jadíd, 2002, p. 57.

\[46\] This scribed lived in Tehran and indicates that she made a copy for the use
of her brother in Kirman. Moojan Momen provides further identification on
her (private communication, May 2007): “… this lady is the great-grand-
daughter of Azal. My information is as follows: Azal > Mírzá Núru'lláh (a
physician living in Rasht) > Mírzá Ahmad Amínu’l-Atibbá, who had two
children, ‘Inayatu’lláh and ‘Atiyyih who married ‘Ali Ruhi (who was a member
of Shaykh Ahmad Ruhi’s family in Kirman). ‘Atiyyih Ruhi was, incidentally
the person who traveled to Cyprus and organized and paid for a shrine over
the grave of Azal.”

Samandar va Mulhaqát, under the title, “Táriíkh Jináb Hájí Nasír
Shahíd”.47 For unexplained reasons it was removed from the
subsequent printing of that book in 131BE [1974], though reference
to it remained in the book’s introduction. The following comment
by the original publisher of Táríkh Samandar appears on page 500 of
that monograph:

> This history was written in the hand of the illustrious
> martyred Hájí Nasír Qazvíní, may my spirit be a sacrifice
> unto his dust. He was present at the fort of Shaykh
> Tabarsí, ranked among the companions [there], and the
> Invisible Host protected [and saved] him. He devoted
> his entire life to the service [of the Cause], attained the
> presence of the Countenance of God48 in ‘Akká, and
> eventually achieved martyrdom in 1300 A.H. [1881] in
Rasht.

The original of this narrative was a book which
> was destroyed. This portion was discovered recently, and
> the late Samandar, upon him rest the Glory of God, has
> established its authenticity.

Of the original text, 14 pages were discovered by Shaykh
Kázim Samandar and transcribed on 10 April 1927 by ‘Abdu’s-
Samad Samadání. The accuracy of this transcription was confirmed
by Tarazu’lláh Samandarí (later appointed as a Hand of Cause), as
the secretary of the Spiritual Assembly approving the publication of
Táríkh Samandar.49

Narrative of Mír Abú-Tálib Shahmírzádí: Mír Abú-Tálib’s father

guardianship of Imám-Zádih Qásim, northeast of Sangar on the way
to Shahmirzad. He was influential and respected in his native town,
and while on a journey to Karbala came upon some of the Báb’s
Writings, the perusal of which convinced him of the truth of the
Báb’s claim. Before his passing, he declared, “Whoever can assist
this Cause must arise to its triumph.”50

It must have been this advice that propelled his son, Mír Abú-
Tálib, though not a Bábí at that time, to serve as a guide for three
Bábís who were on their way to Shaykh Tabarsí. Upon encountering
Mullá Husayn and other companions at the Fort, he declared his
allegiance to the new Faith. He then returned to his native town of
Shahmirzad to inform the population of the events and the Qá’im’s
appearance. A number of people converted, and soon some of them
joined Mír Abú-Tálih and his two brothers at Shaykh Tabarsí. The
author indicates that inasmuch as his mother was old, she wrote a
letter for Quddús stating that even though all believers were
enjoined to hasten to the Fort to aid the defenders, she would keep
the youngest of the four sons, Siyyid Muhammad-Ridá, for her
needs.

Shortly after the arrival of these believers from Shahmirzad
the battles with the Mazandarani forces commenced. The three
brothers participated in the clashes and two of them were killed
during those encounters. Mír Abú-Tálib states that miraculously he
survived. That is, when he returned from their last battle, his
garment was full of bullet holes, but on opening his belt, bullets fell
to the ground, none of them having harmed him in the least.

In the final days of the siege, Quddús summoned Mír Abú-
Tálib and gave him a sealed envelope for his mother. When all the
Bábís were arrested, Mír Abú-Tálib found his way home without the
least objection from the opposing soldiers. He gave the letter to his
mother in which Quddús had stated, “She had acted generously by
giving up her three sons in God’s path. But God was just and had
taken two and allowed her to keep two,” namely, Mír Abú-Tálib and
Siyyid Muhammad-Ridá.

\[50\] Mír Abú-Tálib Shahmírzádí, untitled manuscript, p. 5.

The narrative of Mír Abú-Tálib must have been
commissioned by Bahá’u’lláh, Who instructed several individuals
(such as Mullá Muhammad Shafí‘ Nayrízí) to write their
recollections. This account starts with the meeting of the Sa‘ídu’l-
‘Ulamá with the Bábís, and concludes with the massacre of the
besiegers in May 1849. Along the way, the author takes various
detours from the main story, which in some ways enriches the
narrative. Later this account was the basis of Nabíl Zarandí’s section
on Shaykh Tabarsí. Since this account includes various “miracle
stories”, they must have been removed at the time of the
composition of The Dawn-Breakers.

In addition to Nabíl’s account, Fádil Mázandarání has used
this narrative in his Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, but his copy must have
had some divergences with Nabíl’s (and also with the copies
available to the present translator), as he cites passages unavailable
in other copies.

Two copies of Mír Abú-Tálib’s narrative are known to the
present translator:

> a. A copy in the author’s hand in 63 pages
b. A transcribed copy in the hand of Muhammad-‘Alí Malik-

Khusraví completed in March 1964.
It is hoped that the present translator’s annotated rendering of
this narrative (a project sanctioned by the Bahá’í World Centre) will
be published shortly.

Eyewitness Muslim Narratives
One of the earliest accounts of this incident, which has been largely
overlooked by Bahá’í historians, appeared in the Mazandarani
dialect.51 While one cannot be certain that the author was indeed an
eyewitness, it appears that this account was collected in Babul
(former Barfurush) in 1860 by an informed Muslim contemporary.

\[51\] No reference to this manuscript in Bahá’í published books is known to the
present translator, including Denis MacEoin, The Sources for Early Bábí Doctrine
and History: A Survey; Leiden, 1992.

More recently, this narrative has been translated and published by
Habib Borjian,52 who remarks that it

> was among Nikolai Khanykov’s manuscripts and notes
> kept in the Imperial Public Library at Saint Petersburg.
> Dorn, who provides also a German translation,
> published the text in 1865 in Perso-Arabic characters.53
> He states two reasons for publishing the text: (1) so that
> one can see the details recounted by a witness whose
> truth I do not advocate; (2) (the main reason) that the
> Manzandarani text be shown as a language.” For the

> Muhammad-Taqi Lisan-al-Mulk Sipihr in Násikh al-
> Taváríkh. Moreover, the text in Dorn’s edition carries the
> title min kalám Shaykh al-‘Ajam Mázandarání (From the

> epithet of Amir Pazvari, the semi-legendary Mazandarani

Other Important Bábí Accounts
Two Bábí accounts are particularly important as related to Shaykh
Tabarsí and are briefly mentioned below:

Kitáb Nuqtatu’l-Káf: Based either mostly or in part on an account
by Hájí Mírzá Jání of Kashan, this book is without doubt one of the
earliest Bábí accounts, and enjoys a significant importance in any
discussion of the Bábí histories. The section on Shaykh Tabarsí
provides a few additional nuggets of information not otherwise
available through eyewitness accounts. This book was published by

was commissioned by the mother and sister of Mullá Husayn who
asked Siyyid Muhammad-Hasan Zavárih’í, titled Mahjúr, to
compose a narrative of the episode at Shaykh Tabarsí. To a notable
degree this account reflects the oral history of the Bábí survivors
(known as Baqíyatu’l-Sayf) who are variously mentioned throughout
the text. It also cites information from Lutf-‘Alí Mírzá’s account,
without identifying its author (most likely unknown to Mahjúr).

Early Bahá’í Accounts
Narrative of Siyyid Muhammad-Ridá Shahmírzádí: Being nineteen
years old at the time of his brothers’ departure for Shaykh Tabarsí,
he did not participate in the events, but his account (which appears
to have been composed rather late in life) contains various
references to Shaykh Tabarsí and the condition and sufferings of the
Bábís in various towns concurrent with the events at the Fort. A
text of this narrative in the author’s hand was the basis of a
translation completed by the present writer, which will be published
shortly.

Narrative of Nabíl Zarandí: This is an extensive history of over 1000
pages, which was completed in 1891. The portion detailing the Bábí
history has been published in an edited and abridged English
translation under the title The Dawn-Breakers: Nabíl’s Narrative of the
Early Days of the Bahá’í Revelation, translated and edited by Shoghi
Effendi, Wilmette, 1932.

Narrative of Siyyid Husayn Hamadání: Composed in collaboration
with Mírzá Abu’l-Fadl Gulpáygání, this account adds only slightly to
the information on the Shaykh Tabarsí conflict available in the Kitáb
Nuqtatu’l-Kaf. This narrative was translated and annotated by Prof E.
G. Browne, The Táríkh-i-Jadíd or New History of Mírzá ‘Alí-Muhammad
the Báb (Cambridge, 1893).

Accounts by Qajar Historians

Two official Qajar histories, Násikhu’t-Taváríkh by Mírzá
Muhammad-Taqí the Lisánu’l-Mulk Sipihr, and Raudatu’s-Safá Násirí,
vol. 10, by Ridá-Qulí Khán Hidáyat, contain very valuable details
about Shaykh Tabarsí, often based on military dispatches and other
governmental communications. They suffer, however, from certain
limitations discussed elsewhere by the present translator.58

Narrative of Hájí Nasír Qazvíní

Translated by Ahang Rabbani

[The fragment of Hájí Nasír’s narrative which follows is printed in its original
Persian on pages 501-520 of Táríkh Samandar. It starts at the point when
the Bábís led by Mullá Husayn met Khusraw Qádí-Kalá’í, “a notorious
scoundrel who often rebelled against the government.”59 Translator.]

[Khusraw remarked,] “Apparently there is no need for me and my
two hundred men to remain in your service. Praise God that roads
are safe and with the utmost tranquility you can continue on your
journey. However, I have a request to present to you: As a source of
blessing and felicity, kindly grant me your steed and sword, so I may
have them as signs of divine bounties.” In response, [Mullá Husayn]
stated, “You have asked for two things that both are necessary unto
us. Ask for other objects since we are at the beginning of our
journey. Moreover, you have observed that most people have been
stirred up in entrenched opposition towards us. Therefore, these
two things are both critical and essential to us.”

In response, Khusraw Bayk said, “Since I am a servant of the
Sultan, with the duty to serve as a cavalry soldier and to fight in
battles, I asked for these as a token of blessing so that through this
confirmation would attain victory over the enemy. Otherwise, I
have no need for a horse and a sword. Nay, they are readily
available. [In fact,] I will present you with another horse and saber
to serve you.”

\[59\] The Dawn-Breakers, p. 339, n 2.

At that moment, the honored Báb60, upon him rest God’s
peace, through a divine glance, motioned the esteemed Mírzá
Muhammad-Taqí Khurásání, and he stabbed that wicked scoundrel
[Khusraw] from behind with his knife. He cried loudly when cut,
but Mullá Muhammad-Báqir and some others killed him [instantly]
with their ready swords and sabers. When his men, who had been
standing some distance away, heard the cry of that evildoer, they
immediately ran away, and no trace of his comrades remained.

In short, the mutilated remains of that accursed one were
thrown into a ditch.

At that time, the honored personage [Mullá Husayn]
instructed the companions “Let us leave so we can reach an
inhabited spot.” It so happened that the night was so dark that we
could not even see one another.

Arrival of the Companions at Fort Shaykh Tabarsí
After their departure and proceeding [with their journey], no matter
how hard they tried to find a frequented path, it was not possible.
At this point a traveler appeared and was asked, “Is there a place or
a village in this vicinity that would be inhabited, where we could
spend the night?” “There are no villages in this area;” he responded,
“however, there is a shrine nearby known as Shaykh Tabarsí, though
it has no dwelling.”

The honored Bábu’l-Báb [Mullá Husayn] exclaimed, “That
location is good!” All the companions were unaware that this
utterance was by means of spiritual insight, and that his and others’
rendezvous with destiny lay in that very location. At all events,
outwardly that passerby was the reason that the personage [Mullá
Husayn] and his companions were led to that blessed spot.

\[60\] Towards the latter part of His ministry, the Báb had given His own various
titles to some of His chief disciples. Mullá Husayn had received the title of The
Bábu’l- Báb [the Gate to the Báb], Quddús was known as Hadrat A‘lá [His
Holiness the Exalted One] and Mullá Muhammad-‘Alí Zanjání received the
title of Hujjat.

It was some three hours into the night when they reached that
holy land and spent the night at that place.

Chapter Eleven
Upon settling into the shrine of Shaykh Tabarsí, at dawn, when the
sun broke over the horizon, the muezzins [prayer-callers] raised the
[Islamic] Call to Prayer, and the companions performed their
obligatory prayer and engaged in supplications to the Prayer-
Answerer. After these [prayers] were concluded, they looked around
and considered their surroundings. They saw that with utmost
refinement, attraction and beauty, the shrine was situated in the
midst of that location, with a large courtyard enclosing it. Stretching
around the property was a small fence-wall, two meters in height.

Every manner of profession and worldly occupation could be
found among the exalted companions. For instance, there were
master-carpenters, builders, tailors, masseurs, engravers and
cobblers, as well as many learned men of letters. In short, every
profession was at hand.

[On their first morning] they inspected [the property]. First,
several turrets were built in the vicinity and around the shrine where
sharpshooters were placed for protection and security. Some other
companions also arrayed themselves [in a defensive posture],
believing that with Khusraw’s killing, the town people would arise
against them [i.e. the Bábís]. For several days, they were anticipating
such an attack, thinking that surely a mob [of the enemy] would
assail them. The honored Báb [Mullá Husayn], upon him rest God’s
peace, constantly assured everyone to rely upon God, saying, “Out
of divine bounties and might, they will not be able to overcome us!”

Gradually, the fear and trepidation of these people [i.e. the
Bábís] penetrated the hearts of the people in that region, in such
wise that they trembled in fear from dawn till dusk, thinking that we
would suddenly attack, slay and plunder them.

However, they saw no evidence nor movement from us.

Gradually, they developed a deep confidence in us. In fact, the

inhabitants of villages in that region began visiting and engaging in
conversations [with us]. There was a certain Nazar Khán who lived
a distance of three kilometers from the Fort, who was the head of a
tribe and the village chieftain. He too began to associate with us. He
and others who met us observed that we were rational and dignified
men, whose speech was all based on discernment and insight, and
that our arguments were based on Qur’anic verses and traditions.
They broadly spread the word that “These people are all driven by
spiritual sagacity, law and citizenship. You have said about them:
‘They are a band of thugs and vagabonds who have gathered after
Muhammad Shah’s passing for the purpose of gathering worldly
treasures.’ This is all false. Their words and deeds are consistent
with the religion of Muhammad, and not for one instant are they
negligent of God.”

After the news of the goodly character of these distinguished
men [the Bábís] had penetrated most hearts, the townsfolk began to
visit us as well. They would come in multitudes and ask various
questions, and his honored person [Mullá Husayn] would give
answers suitable to each question.

For a while time passed like this.

Arrival of the Illustrious Quddús to the Fort
The illustrious Quddús, upon him be God’s peace, who was staying
in Sari, came to the Fort with the utmost grandeur and majesty. The
seats of His Holiness Quddús and of the honored Bábu’l-Báb, upon
both be God’s peace, were in the midst of the mosque and shrine of
Shaykh Tabarsí. Group by group, the rest of the companions would
gather for their meals in the courtyard.

Other people who also numbered as our companions [i.e.

were Bábís], who had heard the Word of the Source of Splendor [i.e.
the Báb’s teachings], came from every town. For instance, from
Mazandaran itself came about one hundred men. And from other
regions, such as, Qazvin, Adharbayjan, Isfahan, Qum, Yazd,

Khurasan and its various districts, and Tehran, came others.
Approximately five hundred people were assembled there.61

A while later, the illustrious Quddús composed a prayer and
gave it to one of the companions, commanding, “Take this prayer to
a certain river which flows towards the city. Throw the prayer in the
middle of the river and return.” The believer carried out the
specified instructions.

The illustrious Quddús also wrote a letter to the city-dwellers
which was delivered to its destination. Briefly, its essence was,
“Whoever considers us believers and Muslims and does not come to
our aid is an infidel. And whoever considers us unbelievers and non-
Muslims and does not come to battle us is likewise an infidel.”

They asked His Holiness [Quddús] regarding the secret
enshrined in the prayer. He responded, “The people drink from the
river into which the prayer was thrown. From that, they will grow in
turmoil and clamor.”

As soon as that prayer was composed and thrown into the
river, and the letter was dispatched containing the described
message, the townspeople grew in agitation, raised an army and
soldiers, and marched towards us, settling in a village belonging to
Nazar Khán, near the shrine [of Shaykh Tabarsí].

The next day, a battle ensued. However, our masters [Quddús
and Mullá Husayn] were not present, or maybe the honored Báb,
upon him be God’s peace, was present – at this point, I no longer
recall.

First Battle of the Fort’s Companions
In short, the opposing soldiers were two thousand in number when
the battle commenced. Through divine sovereignty, the companions
rushed in and thoroughly destroyed them. Many of the enemy were
killed, and the rest took to flight. Not one breathing person

\[61\] The original text is rather ambiguous, and can be read indicating that either
500 Bábís came from the mentioned provinces, or that a total of 500 Bábís
had gathered altogether.

remained in the village. Therefore, the command was issued that
whatever belongings were left in the village could be seized as spoils.
The companions hurried and appropriated many possessions and
much food, including, rice, wheat, grains and clothing. Whatever
there was, they brought.

Then command was given that whatever doors or windows
were on homes should be removed and brought – even the bricks
and the lime. In sum, that village was demolished so thoroughly that
no trace remained of it. Nazar Khán escaped as well, and took
residence elsewhere.

Eventually, the news was spread to all surrounding regions
and districts that our exalted men had been victorious [over their
foes].

The thought came to some people that since these men [i.e.

the Bábís] had been triumphant and conquering, therefore it proved
that they possessed the truth, and that God was with them. For this
reason, they began to associate and converse with our people. Some
time passed in this fashion.

Second Battle of the Companions
By Nasiri’d-Dín Shah’s order, the evil Mihdí-Qulí Mírzá was
commissioned [for war against us], and brought a large army with
him. He settled a distance of twelve kilometers away, in a village
which apparently was called Afrád or Afrát. As he remarked, he
wanted to show his presence, and render a notable service to the
Sultan.

The illustrious Quddús stated, “We must attack these gathered
soldiers unexpectedly and at night.” The companions prepared
forthwith and that very night about two hundred of the ablest were
selected. They were led by His Holiness Quddús and the honored
Báb – upon both be God’s peace – who rode on horses while others
walked quietly, so no one heard their approach until they entered
the village. All of a sudden, they attacked and killed a great many [of

the soldiers]. Confounded, Mihdí-Qulí Mírzá fled on a bare-back
horse, while many of his men were slain or took to flight.

In midst of these, an accursed one fired a shot at the honored
Quddús – upon him be God’s peace – which struck his wonder-
dispensing mouth. When the companions witnessed this occurrence,
they took His Holiness and returned. They were deeply saddened
and despondent because of the injury sustained to the mouth of his
holiness, and their victory and triumph turned to sorrow and
sadness.

In short, after his return [to the Fort], His Holiness remained
indoors, and commenced treating the wound to his blessed mouth.

Time passed thus for a while. The news of the injury to his
blessed mouth spread among the people - they even wrote about it
to Tehran, and added, “With so few soldiers, we will not be able to
dislodge these people [i.e. the Bábís]. There is no other way, except
to prepare a large army in the capital and send them here for this
purpose.”

It was then that ministers consulted [in Tehran] and decided
to array an army five thousand soldiers strong, plus several mounted
cannons and several more large guns, and all the necessary lead,
powder and shells and to dispatch them.

They came and camped at a distance of three kilometers from
the shrine. From all surrounding districts, whoever of the
inhabitants had military experience was added to the camp as well.
In overall command was ‘Abbás-Qulí Khán, the Sardár Larjání, who
placed rank upon rank of men around us, circling and surrounding
us like a ring on a finger.

During the time that we were at that location [fort Tabarsí], all
provisions were available in copious quantities. However, when
company after company of the troops came, they completely
blockaded all provisions from us.

At this time, the illustrious Quddús instructed that the
companions prepare to make a sudden attack at night. However,
since the honored Quddús – upon him be God’s peace – was
injured in his blessed mouth and was busy with recovery and general

infirmity had overtaken his sanctified being, he could not participate
[in this campaign].

Third Battle of the Fort’s Companions
The honored Báb – upon him be God’s peace – led the
companions. Two hours before dawn we exited the Fort. Silently,
we approached [the military camp] and entered with cries of “Yá
Sáhibu’z-Zamán62”. With unsheathed sabers, we set upon that
wretched band. Since the enemy was many and we [i.e. the Bábís]
were few, the battle was lost. It was a particularly dark night which
resulted in both sides being unable to distinguish [friend from foe].
When sabers were brought down, one could not tell if it stuck one’s
own men or the enemy’s. For this reason, a great many were killed –
often by the hand of their own side.

Injury of the Honored Bábu’l-Báb
In the midst of the battle, the companions learned that the honored
Báb – upon him be God’s peace – was struck by a bullet. That news
completely robbed them of their strength and caused them to lose
heart. They could no longer remain in the battlefield. Therefore,
they took the honored Bábu’l-Báb and withdrew [to the Fort]. The
companions were scattered. On realizing that his friends and
comrades had returned [to the Fort], whoever was left behind, one
by one made his way back as well.

There were many of our companions who had received bullet
wounds, and had fallen with no strength left in them. After the
companions who had not been injured returned, the foes saw and
recognized them as not being of their own, and killed them.

At any rate, after the return of the companions who carried
with them the honored [Mullá Husayn] – upon him rest God’s

\[62\] Lit. The Lord of the Age, one of the titles of the promised Qá’im.

peace – it was only a short moment before the sanctified spirit of
that noble person winged its flight to the Sacred Realm.

Of the friends, about fifty had suffered martyrdom. The
opponents took their own fallen men and withdrew a distance. The
esteemed friends, upon seeing their departure, went to the
battlefield and carried back with them the bodies and the remains of
the martyrs, among them the honored Mullá ‘Abdu’l-Jalíl and Áqá
Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí,63 who were martyred in that battle.

That day witnessed a great cataclysm in the shrine of Shaykh
Tabarsí. On one side was the honored Báb – upon him be God’s
peace – who died as a martyr. On the other side were about fifty of
our dearly-cherished companions who in the battlefield had each
hastened to the Abode of the Merciful, Almighty God. The sacred
remains of some of the martyrs were left in the opposing camp,
while the enemy had severed some of their heads and carried these
away with them as gifts and prizes.

In short, first the honored Quddús instructed that a burial
shroud be prepared for the honored Báb and that he be buried in
the corner of the shrine of Shaykh Tabarsí while still wearing his
own garments. He then ordered that the martyrs who had fallen in
the enemy’s camp be collected one by one, and brought to the
courtyard of Shaykh Tabarsí. He further commanded that on the
side of the door that entered the mosque of Shaykh Tabarsí, situated
on the eastern flank of the courtyard, a ditch be dug about five or
six meters (in length and depth) and that collectively the sanctified
remains of the martyrs be placed in that grave, in the same clothes
that they had worn [in the battle]. They were placed next to each
other and earth was poured over them, thereby hiding their remains.

After the burial of the martyrs, everyone was profoundly sad
and despondent, wondering how his own end would come about.
Some hearts wavered, since what their frail minds had imagined had

\[63\] The two mentioned Bábí martyrs were from Qazvin – the author’s native
town. According to The Dawn-Breakers, p. 423, Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí had
attained the presence of the Báb in Shiraz and was one of the Letters of the
Living.

not come to pass. The honored Báb, who was their champion, and
in the field of battle had shown the greatest valor and peerless
leadership, was now gone. Gone were also some of the friends who
had fallen in the battle just concluded. In addition to this, food
provisions were essentially depleted as well.

Several people left. Included among those was Áqá Rasúlí, a
native of Mazandaran who lived in a district known as Bahnamiri.
He left together with his people, who numbered about fifty. It so
happened that when they departed, the enemy seized them all
collectively and each was killed in a different district in that region,
thereby spreading the news of their victory, or as they believed,
signs of blessings and divine favors for their deeds.

In sum, a mighty clamor and upheaval occurred in that realm.

When the enemy saw that the situation was most difficult for us,
they attacked en masse. That is, the soldiers who had come from
Tehran were situated at a distance of three kilometers and had not
come near the shrine [of Shaykh Tabarsí]. They were waiting to see
what would befall the Mazandarani soldiers who had been
assembled from the region, who were led by ‘Abbás-Qulí Khán
Larjání. It became evident that while some of their soldiers had been
killed, much vital strength had left us as well.

Therefore, they began to advance from their locations, and
established a new camp for themselves near the shrine of Shaykh
Tabarsí, at a distance of approximately five hundred steps.

Until that time, the opposing army had not completely
surrounded the shrine, because their number was no more than two
or three thousand, and they were insufficient to completely encircle
[the Fort]. Subsequently, they had stayed [only] on one side.

One last time, they assembled and further summoned men
from all regions of Mazandaran. Together with soldiers from
Tehran, they gradually came together and thoroughly encircled us.

The esteemed companions were housed in the courtyard of
the shrine of Shaykh Tabarsi. That is, before any hostilities had
occurred, day and night all the companions had dug a trench around
Shaykh Tabarsí, which had been a fort in previous times. The trench
was three meters wide and three meters deep. The [excavated] earth

was thrown behind the trenches and wooden, fortified fences built
over it. Turrets were built in six locations and, on rotation, from the
rank of companions sharpshooters were selected to man them day
and night. The rest of the companions, in groups of five or ten men,
had built huts in the shrine’s courtyard. These were made of wood,
and the roof was covered by hay to protect them from snow and
rain. These makeshifts served as their dwellings. Food and
provisions for each person was provided from what had been
purchased and from the [war] spoils, and stored in each hut.

After a while, the food ran out. There were some [provisions]
in the kitchen of the dwelling occupied by the illustrious Quddus,
who instructed that each day one or two sír64 [of ration] be given to
each person. It went like this until no trace of rice or wheat
remained.

All that was then left were several horses belonging to the
companions. Each day, two or three of the horses were slaughtered
and the meat distributed among the companions.

Before these incidents, the horse used by the honored Báb,
upon him rest God’s peace, was tied in the shrine’s courtyard when
shot [by the enemy]. Instantly, that horse had become a sacrifice for
that distinguished and exalted personage [Mullá Husayn].
Instructions were given for the horse to be buried in the same
courtyard. When all the horses had been killed and consumed,
[Quddús] ordered that the honored Báb’s horse be exhumed and its
flesh distributed. Therefore, the grave of that horse, which
outwardly was an animal but in essence had acquired human virtues,
were opened and its flesh divided among everyone. The
companions ate that meat with the utmost delight and gratitude
even though it was spoiled.

After the horse flesh was finished, our ration was limited to
the horse skins. The skin of each horse was torn into pieces, divided
among all, and then fried over the fire and consumed like kabob –
chewed and eaten.

\[64\] A measure of weight in Iran, corresponding to 75 grams.

After the horse skins were finished, all that was left were the
bones from the horses. These too were divided among everyone and
each bone was fried over the fire, smashed and consumed with
some warm water. In such wise, the pangs of hunger were dealt
with.

The enemy now numbered ten or twelve thousand strong, and
had gathered from all districts and locations in that region. They
camped nearby. The governor65 at that time was Mihdí-Qulí Mírzá,
and he left the town and settled in nearby. The soldiers were divided
and situated on all four sides of the companions. For each division
of soldiers a commander was appointed, and one each prepared a
fortification for his soldiers. Moreover, they raised what they called
bastions66 and placed the cannons on top of them.

Of the condition and the situation of the companions in the
shrine, they had gathered and shared detailed information. They
knew especially that our food provisions had been completely
depleted, saying, “To the point that even desert weeds, to wet their
mouths, are not available and are denied to them.” They [i.e. the
military] had also cut off the flow of water that filled the trenches
[around the Fort].

No one was able to go out [of the Fort] and even wild
vegetation was unattainable. The situation had become most
difficult.

In short, after the troops were in place, they began firing guns
from all directions and bombardment by cannons and artilleries
which they had trained [towards the Fort]. The shells would ascend
high and land in the Fort’s courtyard, and upon contact would go
into the ground about a half meter, then explode and kill several
men in its range.

At any rate, a long while passed in this fashion, while the
companions were thoroughly robbed of their vitality to even step
outside the aforementioned shrine. Their principle injury occurred

with the martyrdom of the honored Báb, upon him be God’s peace,
who was the heart of the contingent world. With his death, the heart
of the companions collapsed and withered completely as well.

[It appears that a section of the narrative is missing at this point. This section
must have covered the final stage of the Bábí struggle at Shaykh Tabarsí, the
deceit of the military leaders in drawing out the besieged, and the ensuing
massacre of the remaining defenders of the Fort. The section that follows,
however, appears to be the concluding segment of the aftermath of the conflict at
Shaykh Tabarsí, where a list of various martyrs is provided. Translator.]

At any event, after the goods were prepared, I contacted a
muleteer and entrusted the loads to him, and from the same
muleteer rented steeds for myself and my attendant. However, I was
thoroughly unaware of the schemes that satanic men were
concocting behind the veils.

Before all of this, a certain group had gone from Yazd to
Tehran to complain to the Sultan about the suppression and
persecutions brought about by their governor. At that time, the
Sultan’s Prime Minister was the Sadr-A‘zam – may he be cursed –
and this vicious man swayed the mind of that infidel [i.e. Yazd’s
governor]. He had wanted to disperse that band of men and prevent
them from informing the Sultan of the oppression and tyranny of
the governor, since the governor’s deeds had been at the Sadr-
A‘zam’s request.

Therefore, the Sadr-A‘zam had remarked to the Sultan, “A
band of these Bábís have gathered in the capital, and it is absolutely
against the interests of the victorious government for them to be
here, as they may cause injuries.” Subsequently, the Sultan instructed
for that group to be dispersed, and his order was carried out. In fact,
as soon as they were labeled as such [i.e. were called Bábí or Bahá’í],
they dispersed of their own accord. The reason was that in those
days as soon as someone was labeled as such, even if he was not [a
Bábí], he would be subjected to the Shah’s reprimand and
punishment.

After that group was dispersed, the governor of Qazvin, who
was named Hájí Hasan-‘Alí Khán Khú’í,70 and was tarrying in the

pilahvarí can be either a reference to silk or to general hucksters of interest to
the haberdashers.

\[70\] According to Mihdi Bamdad, Sharh Hál Rijál Iran, vol. 1, p. 354, Hájí Hasan-
‘Alí Khan Khú’í Ájúdán-Báshí was dismissed from office in 1264 AH [1848]
and died in 1277 AH [1860]. It does not seem likely, however, that the same
person is intended, yet the present translator has been unable to locate any
reference to another governor with the same name.

government-house in Tehran at that time, was summoned for a
private conversation with the Sadr-A‘zam. He had described the
essence of the situation, adding, “From such a town [Yazd], several
people had come with complains and protests against the governor,
who was charged with a certain mission. Therefore, to protect my
own interests, I accused them of being Bábí, and, with the Shah’s
consent, dispersed them. However, it is now necessary that
outwardly my claim about these belligerent people should appear to
be true before the Shah. Since in Qazvin there are some of these
Bábís, you should tell your men to seize one or two of them and to
send them here, so that I may present them to the Shah in support
of my contention that these people are hostile.”

At this, Hájí Hasan-‘Alí Khan wrote to his son, Naqí Khán. At
that time, there was great camaraderie and unity between Hájí Mírzá
Mufíd, the Shaykhu’l-Islam, and Hájí Hasan-‘Alí. Therefore, the
governor wrote him also, “Kindly join hands with Naqí Khán and
locate one or two natives of that town who are accused of this
appellation [i.e. being Bábí]. Seize and dispatch them to Tehran.”

These two men, namely, Hájí Mírzá Mufíd the Shaykhu’l-Islam
and Naqí Khán, son of Hájí Hasan-‘Alí, inquired of some of the
town’s mischief-makers, and in turn, those individuals, out of their
innately base character, named this unworthy dust [Hájí Nasír]. They
said to Hájí Hasan-‘Alí Khán’s men, who were Hájí Mírzá Mufíd
and Naqí Khán, “This person belongs to that group [i.e. the Bábís].”
In short, they manifested whatever enmity and hostility they
harbored in their hearts. However, they also were told from outside
[of Qazvin], “This person has prepared and left for a journey to
Gilan.”
