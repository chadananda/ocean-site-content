> 2 A Lifetime With ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

Translator’s Foreword

One of the distinguishing features of the Bábí and Bahá’í religions is the
existence of a large number of eyewitness accounts and primary source
materials that closely document the founding and development of the
movements in their formative period, 1844-1921. Of this era, the largest
number of historical documents pertains to the ministry of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s. Indeed, beyond thousands of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s own
communications that present enormous details about the people and
early history of the Faith, thousands of pages of other eyewitness
documents closely chronicle vast portions of His activities and words,
and of those around Him – leaving a precious reservoir of information
for generations of historians to study, analyze and correlate, and for the
faithful to emulate.

The present narrative is one such document. In exceptionally
simple but direct and sincere language, the narrator recalls many
episodes of his interactions, spanning over four decades, with ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, Shoghi Effendi or Bahá’í residents of the environs of ‘Akká-Haifa.
Khalíl Shahídí makes it clear that he did not set out to write a detailed
history of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s august Personage or His ministry for a
worldwide audience.

His objective was much more personal and immediate. At the
insistence of family members, Shahídí was moved to share stories and
recollections of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi that had been
inscribed on his heart, and through them to encourage, inspire and even
edify his kinsmen or anyone else that would come upon his narrative.

The stories are simple. Their common denominators are the
wisdom of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, firmness in the Cause and obedience to the
Head of the Faith – for in these, Shahídí believed, lies one’s salvation.

If one had to identify an overarching theme in this narrative, surely
it would be constancy in Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant, since it is this subject,
perhaps mentioned more frequently and with greater emotional
investment than any other, which the narrator returns to time and again.
This theme appears to be his life biography, for Shahídí was born in
‘Akká in 1894 and his formative years corresponded with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
Khalíl Shahídí 3

ministry when opposition to His leadership was unabated. Shahídí
observed – indeed experienced firsthand – the relentless attack of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s faithless brothers, other family members and their
cohorts, and the turbulent period of the first four decades of the
Twentieth Century in the Holy Land. As a trusted resident believer of
‘Akká and a longtime custodian of the House of ‘Abbúd, he was at a
unique vantage point to observe ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as He dealt, neutralized
and triumphed over all opposition and adversaries.

The stories told are unadorned and unencumbered with historical
details, such as, dates, locations, participants and such. Shahídí explains:

> It should be clear to the esteemed readers that these
> recollections are composed without any preliminaries or
> conclusions, or citing specific dates. This is because the
> passage of time and days has robbed this servant of that
> ability. However, the events recorded, or those that are
> recounted, are mentioned without any addition or loss. Due
> to the passage of time, I may have forgotten some small
> details of certain incidents and, therefore, have not recorded
> those events [in this narrative], nor will they appear in the
> subsequent pages.

A careful reader will observe that these stories fill many details
about various aspects of occurrences in the early years of the Faith.
However, more importantly, they provide us with a window into the life
and days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá which is personal, direct and unfiltered.
History, in its authentic form, is based on such raw materials.

A Short Biography
Shahídí’s family background can be traced to the early days of the Bábí
Faith in Qum. It was there that his grandfather, Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl, had
embraced the Báb’s movement and led his brother, Áqá Husayn, to the
reform movement in their native town. Not long after that, misfortune
fell upon them and they were seized by the forces of orthodoxy. They
were taken to Tehran and imprisoned. Their hardships in the dungeon
4 A Lifetime With ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

were so severe that after two years, Áqá Husayn passed away. However,
Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl endured his great sufferings for seven years of
incarceration. At last when he was released, he went to Baghdad around
1862, where he attained the presence of Bahá’u’lláh and was won over.

He remained in Baghdad and served Bahá’u’lláh’s House – one of
the two sites of the Bahá’í hajj [obligatory pilgrimage] – as a waterman,
by carrying water in sheepskin from the nearby river to the House.1 For
five years, he performed this duty and many others with exemplary
faithfulness and dedication.

About 1867, Mírzá Buzurg Khán, the Iranian Consul in Istanbul,
assisted by Shaykh ‘Abdu’l-Husayn ‘Iráqí, a Muslim cleric and an
inveterate enemy of Bahá’u’lláh since His days in Baghdad, stirred up
mischief and brought about a wave of persecutions against the Bahá’ís of
that town.

One morning, as Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl was by the riverside carrying a
sheepskin of water to the House of Bahá’u’lláh, two men approached, set
upon him and with daggers tore open his bowels. He staggered on,
clinging with one hand to his load of water, holding back with the other
his entrails, until he reached the house. Then he collapsed and expired.2

Later a crowd of people gathered at the Muslim cemetery to
prevent his burial there. Eventually the authorities intervened, and he
was buried by their order.

1 Since there was no running water in the homes, there were men whose occupation
it was to carry skins full of water for household use and sometimes gardening.
2 This incident is referred to by Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p. 178. It should be

noted that no person from a Shi‘i background could read this story without being
reminded of the events of Karbala. The party of the Imam Husayn was deliberately
cut off from the river and was dying of thirst. The half-brother of the Imam
Husayn, ‘Abbás, volunteered to try to get to the water and bring some back. He was
attacked by the Umayyad forces and literally hacked to pieces with their swords as
he desperately made his way back to the encampment carrying water. He died trying
to get the water to them. All this is commemorated yearly in the Muharram rituals
and forms an important part of the sequence of events that are the Karbala mythos.
Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasul was also getting water from the river and was carrying it back
when he was attacked and cut with a sword and he died in his attempt to bring
water. And this occurred only about 50 miles from the site of the Karbala events.
(Moojan Momen, posting 24 February 2008 on Tarikh discussion group.)
Khalíl Shahídí 5

Áqá Husayn Áshchí gives a graphic and moving account of the
day when the letter conveying the news of the martyrdom of Áqá
‘Abdu’r-Rasúl reached Bahá’u’lláh. Those who were present and heard
Bahá’u’lláh read the account wept unrestrainedly.3 Bahá’u’lláh assured
them that they were lamenting the cruel death of Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl, but
he had attained what he had always desired - the station of martyrdom.

In some of His Tablets, Bahá’u’lláh has mentioned ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl,
recounted his sufferings and remembered him with much tenderness and
affection as shahíd [witnessed or martyred].

Bahá’u’lláh also revealed a Tablet of Visitation for Áqá ‘Abdu’r-
Rasúl Shahíd and showered His bounties upon his soul:

> O Rasúl! He Who is the King of Existence and the Lord of
> Hosts doth make mention of thee from this all-glorious
> Abode. We, verily, shall inform thee of that Rasúl who
> soared in Mine atmosphere; spoke forth My praise amongst
> My servants; and was so transported by the living waters of
> Mine utterance that he laid down his life in My path. Thus
admonisheth thee He with Whom is the Guarded Book.

O My most exalted Pen! Make mention of My servant
> Rasúl, who was martyred in Zawrá’. He it was who had been
> entrusted with the task of providing water for My Sacred
> House, succeeding in this function to the servant in
> attendance before the throne of God, the Help in Peril, the
> Self-Subsisting. He, of a truth, set out at dawn to supply
> with water the House of God in the Day of the Covenant,
> when lo, the infidels slew him with such cruelty that all
> things, and those who, with lowliness and submission, have
circled the throne, lamented.

Do thou remember him on My behalf, and say: “The
> first breath that was diffused from the flowers of the garden
> of Divine mysteries be upon thee, O thou who didst speak
> forth in commemoration of the Lord of all names, and didst
> set thy face towards the Supreme Horizon! I testify that

Rabbani).

> thou didst hearken unto the Call, and didst direct thyself
> unto Zawrá’, the seat of the throne of thy Lord, the Creator
> of the heavens, until thou didst enter this all-glorious
> Abode, and attain the presence of God, the Lord of the
> visible and the invisible. Thou art he whom neither the
> clamor of the nations, nor the distractions of the world,
> could deter, who didst turn alike with thy face, thine eyes,
> thine heart and all thy members unto God, the King of

> martyrdom in the path of this Wronged One. Upon thee be
> the Glory of God; the Glory of all who are in heaven and on
> earth; and the Glory of all who have believed in God, the
> All-Glorious, the Loving.”4

Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl had two sons:

1. Áqá Muhammad-Hasan Mansúr, who accompanied Bahá’u’lláh as

> a youth to ‘Akká. A deeply learned man and an exceptionally
> devoted Bahá’í, he never married and served most of his adult life
> as the custodian of pilgrim houses in ‘Akká and Haifa. He passed
> away circa 1928-1929 at the House of Abbúd.

2. Abú’l-Qásim was a coppersmith, and married Dhikriyyih, who is

> remembered as Umm-Khalíl (thus known after her eldest
> surviving son). They had four sons and a two daughters:

a. Jamílih was born during Bahá’u’lláh’s time, and her name

was bestowed by Him. She passed away at an early age.
b. Jamíl was born in Bahá’u’lláh’s days also, and named by

Him. He, too, appears to have passed away at a young age.

translation was graciously offered to this monograph by a Bahá’í scholar who wishes
to remain anonymous.

Khalíl Shahídí 7

c. Khalíl, the eldest surviving son, was born in 1894. He was

> raised in ‘Akká, where he assumed his father’s occupation.
> He, his mother and other siblings were entrusted by ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá as the custodians of the House of ‘Abbúd. He married
> in 1923, and around 1948, when Shoghi Effendi directed
> some resident Bahá’ís to leave ‘Akká-Haifa area, Khalíl and
> his family moved to Iran. Khalíl and his wife, Zaynab, had
> eleven children. He passed away on 15 November 1971 in
> Tehran.
d. Davúd ‘Akká’wí was married to Munavar, the daughter of

> Surúsh Núsh, a Bahá’í from ‘Adasiyyih of Zoroastrian
> descent. They had a son named Abú’l-Qásim, and a younger
> daughter. This family also lived in the House of ‘Abbúd, but
> later were directed by the Guardian to move to Asasiyyih in
> Jordan.

> e. Adíb ‘Akká’wí never married and passed away in Jordan.
f. Rafiyah married ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl. This family also moved to

> Iran at the Guardian’s behest. They had two sons: Ibráhím
> and Badí‘ (who served in the office of the National Spiritual
> Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Iran in Tehran).5

Shahídí’s Reminiscences
In 1965, Badí‘ Mansúr, a nephew of the narrator, was asked to devote
some time taking dictations as Shahídí spoke his recollections.6 It
appears that this was not only requested by the family, but also eagerly
encouraged by Iran’s Bahá’í Publishing Committee, which then took
steps to prepare the manuscript for publication. The Committee
appointed an editor (typically a learned member of its body) to edit and

5 ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl had a brother, ‘Abdu’s-Samad, who was a carpenter and lived in
Jaffa. When the family of Bahá’u’lláh left the Mansion in disrepair, Shoghi Effendi
asked ‘Abdu’s-Samad to undertake the necessary remodeling. ‘Abdu’s-Samad had a
son, Mansúr, who is remembered as having lived in a house east of the Pilgrim
House by the Shrine of the Báb. (Hossein Achtchi, posting on Tarikh discussion
group, December 2007.)

extract those passages suitable for immediate publication. The Persian
original text seems to have been lightly edited and sections identified
towards this objective. The editor notes (appended as page 257 of
narrative):

> The lines that have been drawn through these memoirs for
> division and correction were done so by Lajnih Mujaljalih
> Nashr Nafahat [The Committee for Diffusion of Divine
> Fragrances] and for this reason, this servant thought best
that it remain intact, and a clean copy was not reproduced.

> This was written for [the reader’s] information.

[Signature unreadable]

It appears that the intense publication schedule of the Committee
in the late 1960s and early ‘70s, and then the Islamic Revolution in Iran,
interrupted plans for publication of this document. Surprisingly, though,
it appears that this singularly important document remained unavailable
to the three scholars who published in early 1970s extensive studies on
the life and times of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, namely, the Hand of the Cause of
God Hasan Balyuzi, Muhammad-‘Alí Fayzí and Houshang Mahmudi,
nor to the translator’s knowledge was it used by any other author .

A close read of the Persian text makes it clear that the narrative is
simple spoken words. That is, no attempt was made to systematize the
presentation or use elevated language typically used in the Persian
literature of the Faith. Further, it is clear that the author, while
comfortable with spoken Persian, was not schooled in that language.
Given that Shahídí was born and raised in ‘Akká, it is perfectly
understandable that his “mother tongue” would have been Arabic. This
point is mentioned because the original Persian is not particularly
eloquent, though remarkably sincere. One finds many examples of this
throughout the narrative.

Since the account is a primary source document, every effort was
made to translate it precisely in the style and manner of the original, in
hope that by so doing it would convey a flavor of the original text. This
produced a certain inelegance in the translation, that for the sake of
authenticity and faithfulness to the original were overlooked. For

Khalíl Shahídí 9

instance, the narrator always refers to Shoghi Effendi as “The Guardian
of the Cause of God,” without any variation on this title, or Bahíyyih
Khánum is often referred to as “the Liege Lady of the people of Bahá.”
These titles have been kept. Also, kept were such titles for Bahá’u’lláh as,
“the Blessed Beauty”, “Supreme Pen”, and the like; or “the Exalted
One” for the Báb.

However, since this document is principally about ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
for the sake of clarity most of titles used for Him were replaced with
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Among the titles used by the narrator one often finds
Mawla al-Wará’, which means the Lord of Mankind.7 This too was
replaced with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

The page numbers of the original manuscript are indicated in
pointed brackets, such as <p.10>, every five pages.

Footnotes have been added to augment information, clarify
obscure points, and provide a more detailed perspective. Occasionally,
comments by the translator have been added to improve the clarity or
continuity of the material. These comments are enclosed in square
brackets, thus […]. All comments within parentheses are by the author,
Khalíl Shahídí.

The system of transliteration used in this monograph is consistent
with the method used in other academic publications and varies from the
system used in most Bahá’í publications by: (1) avoiding subdots and
underlines (e.g., Fádil), and (2) dropping the izafih connecting the first
name to the surname (e.g., Khalíl Shahídí, instead of Khalíl-i-Shahídí).

Since any single Islamic year (denoted AH) typically overlaps with
two Christian years, where only the Islamic year of the event is known,
the equivalent Gregorian date is given as the first of the two years
partially covered by that Islamic year.
7This title appears in many early Persian publications on the life of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
but with far less frequency at the present. The title is not Qur’anic, but it is found in
many Shi‘i hadith, where one finds it used as a title of both Imam ‘Alí and the
Twelfth Imam. In the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, beginning perhaps with the Kitáb-i
Aqdas, the designation finds life again, but with a new meaning as an appellation of
God (i.e. His Manifestation). At some later point, perhaps starting with Shoghi
Effendi, it appears that it was adopted as a title of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and for a while
other Persian writers seem to have followed suit. (Omid Ghaemmaghami, posting
on Tarikh discussion list, December 2007.)

Typically, the original text refers to the Central Figures by such
honorific titles as “His Holiness” or “His blessed Person,” and these
honorifics have been omitted in some instances. Nor does the
translation reproduce such expressions commonly used in the Iranian
literature of the Bahá’í Faith as, “May my life be a sacrifice unto His
Sacred Threshold.”

By the time Shahídí give expression to his memoirs, many
principal personalities featured in this history had died, and the original
text therefore often refers to them as “the late” or “the deceased.” These
terms, too, have largely been omitted.

It should be emphasized that the spoken words attributed to the
Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in these pages cannot be assigned
scriptural authority or equated with their authorized Writings. No one
took notes at the time those words were uttered, although it cannot be
ruled out that some may indeed be the very words spoken.

All renderings of the Sacred Writings from Persian and Arabic,
unless otherwise specified, are by the present translator. If an authorized
source (such as Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh) is not cited, then the renderings
should be considered as falling in the class of provisional translations
intended to convey the essence (mazmún) of communications by the
Founders of the Bábí and Bahá’í Faiths. Such summary renderings are
not to be confused with full authorized translations of the Bahá’í Holy
Texts, which will be disseminated in due time by the Bahá’í World
Centre.

Narrator’s Preamble

My kinsmen and friends have urged this servant to commit for posterity
as a memento such recollections as have remained with me from the
blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá – the Most Mighty Branch of God and the
Mystery of the Lord, the Compassionate – and the beloved and chosen
Guardian of the Cause of God, may my spirit be a sacrifice unto their
station. However, it was observed that all important occurrences that
transpired during these two sacred ministries have been recorded most
befittingly and completely, with eloquence and clarity, in the history of
the Cause. Therefore, it was decided not to write about such episodes,
particularly since innumerable scrolls and Tablets revealed from the
heaven of the will and decree of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Center of divine
Covenant and Testament, and the Guardian of the Cause of God, the
sacred essence of divinity, nothing has been left undisclosed. Indeed,
even the most minute details and occurrences have been revealed and
stand clear and manifest to everyone.

Consequently, I will write of such events that outwardly are very
simple, but in their own allotted sphere contain important insights, as
they have not been recorded elsewhere, although a portion of these
memoirs pertains to this servant and his relatives.
I beseech the prayers of the esteemed readers.

Reminiscences of

[Birth and Family Heritage]
The birth of this servant took place two years after the ascension of the
Blessed Perfection and Beauty – exalted and supreme is His
remembrance – and occurred in the city of ‘Akká.8 The beloved
Guardian of the Cause of God, with no resemblance [to me], was six
months younger than this servant and my mother was a milk-nurse for
him.9 It was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Who named this servant Khalíl, and after a
while Khalílu’lláh streamed from His blessed tongue.

On my father’s side, this servant is a grandson of Áqá ‘Abdu’r-
Rasúl Shahíd [martyr], who was martyred in Baghdad. His martyrdom is
described in the history books of the Cause. For this reason, our family
name became Shahídí.

My paternal uncle was Áqá Muhammad-Hasan, who was the
custodian of [‘Akká’s] pilgrim house.

My father was Áqá Abú’l-Qásim, who was a coppersmith and
most accomplished in this craft. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá often called him Ustád
Abú’l-Qásim, and consequently he was known and recognized by all by
this name. This servant also mastered that same craft.

The mother of this lowly one was of the believers of Baghdad. Her
name was Dhikriyyih, a daughter of Ahmad Vallí. Her mother was
Khamiyyih, who attained the presence of the Blessed Beauty in the Holy
Land. She used to extemporize verses in Arabic in praise and admiration
of the Blessed Perfection, the Holy Family and other kindred, and would
bring joy to His blessed Person. <p.5> She passed away in Haifa during
that time.

8The ascension of Bahá’u’lláh took place on 29 May 1892.
9 According to Rúhiyyih Rabbání, The Priceless Pearl, p. 4, “On the 27th day of
Ramadan, 1314 of the Muslim calendar, Shoghi Effendi was born. This was Sunday,
1 March 1897 of the Gregorian calendar. These dates have been found in one of
Shoghi Effendi’s notebooks which he kept during his boyhood, written in his own
hand.”

It was during the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that my father,
Ustád Abú’l-Qásim Shahídzádih, passed from this nether world to the
everlasting abode. When His blessed Person [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] was
outwardly informed of this incident, He was so saddened that tears
poured from His blessed eyes. He attended the funeral in ‘Akká’s Bahá’í
cemetery in His carriage. He [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] used to say, “Ustád Abú’l-
Qásim was constant and firm like a mountain. Nothing would make him
waver, and in fact events would make him more steadfast and faithful.”

[The Covenant-breakers]
At a time of revolt and intensity in the Covenant-breaking, in one day
‘Abdu’l-Bahá repeatedly summoned him [my father] three times and
each time restated these utterances and blessed instructions along with
His exhortations and directions, “Ustád Abú’l-Qásim, I ask you, implore
you, that if with your own ears you heard the Covenant-breakers insult
Me, disregard it.” He greatly emphasized this point. His blessed intention
was for the friends of God to remain silent in face of the scorn and
uproar of the ill-wishing Covenant-breakers so that incidents that would
precipitate complications and difficulties resulting in harm to God’s
Cause were prevented.

[Ustád Abú’l-Qásim]
One night, a gathering was assembled in the blessed House in ‘Akká and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “May God’s mercy surround Ustád Abú’l-
Qásim. It was too soon.” Meaning he left this world too early.

One day, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had invited the friends of God to lunch in
the pilgrim house of Bahjí, situated next to the blessed Shrine [of
Bahá’u’lláh]. When He was welcoming the friends to sit for the meal and
serving each one, suddenly He said, “Ustád Abú’l-Qásim, Bismi’lláh.10
Welcome.” He then paused for a short while. It was certain that
everything stood evident before His Holiness and He was beholding the
spirits that were present and observant.

10   Lit. In the Name of God, it is an expression of welcome.

One day, He [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] was passing by my shop and saw that
I was engaged in work. He remarked, “Marhabá, marhabá!11 Give light to
your father’s shop!”12

[Muhammad-Hasan Khádim]
It was during the blessed days of the Guardian of the Cause of God –
may my spirit be a sacrifice unto him – that my paternal uncle, Áqá
Muhammad-Hasan, passed away in the blessed House [of ‘Abbúd] in
‘Akká, where, in accordance with the instructions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, these
ephemeral servants were in residence and in service. When the Guardian
of the Cause of God heard this news in Haifa, he dispatched one of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s turbans and instructed, “Adorn Áqá Muhammad-Hasan’s
head with this.” He also sent a bottle of perfume and by his instruction,
a number of friends from Haifa arrived and with utmost dignity, his
earthly remains were interred in the Bahá’í cemetery of ‘Akká. However,
his tombstone has not been raised until the present.

[Áqá Muhammad-Hasan] was the recipient of numerous Tablets
from the Blessed Perfection and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and was the object of
their utmost bounties and grace. This was because in accordance with
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s wish, he had devoted his life in service of the pilgrims in
the pilgrim houses of ‘Akká and Haifa and before that in Baghdad. For
this reason he had remained single and had never married.

In the course of his life, which was eighty-one years long, he had
prepared seven exquisite collections of Traces and Writings of the
Blessed Perfection and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. In truth, whoever saw them was
astonished and would express gratitude for his labor, since he had
arranged and prepared [these collections] with great beauty and
attractiveness. In consideration that these were among the most
important collections of Writings, these ephemeral servants jointly
presented those precious albums to <p.10> the blessed presence of the
Guardian of the Cause of God – may my spirit be a sacrifice unto him –
which brought immense joy to his blessed heart, and he spoke many
expressions of kindness. After a while, he informed us, “I have sent
11   Lit. Welcome, or well done.
12   Give light is a Persian expression, meaning give splendor, or glorify his work.

those collections to America for them to remain protected in their
archives as a remembrance [of Áqá Muhammad-Hasan].”

[‘Akká’s Bahá’í Cemetery]
Until the present, the Bahá’í cemetery of ‘Akká has not received due
attention and proper beautification. At one time, it was decided to raise a
wall around it. After some of this work was completed, one night, the
enemies of the Cause destroyed what had been built and it remains in the
same condition to this day.

[My Family]
My mother and brother, Adíb, passed away in the honored village of
‘Adasiyih.13 This was because after the upheavals that occurred in
Palestine and the Holy Land, the Guardian of the Cause of God – may
my life be a sacrifice unto him – willed that they should reside in that
region in order to be freed from certain complications.

Likewise, these ephemeral servants were instructed to migrate to
Tehran. At present, my brother, Dávud, and his wife and children
remain in that region [‘Adasiyih], situated in the eastern Jordan.

For thirty years, my mother served in the blessed House [of
‘Abbúd] in ‘Akká and was the recipient of immense favors and
considerations of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Greatest Holy Leaf – the Liege Lady
of the people of Bahá – and the beloved Guardian of the Cause, may my
spirit be a sacrifice unto the wrongs they suffered. She was extremely
faithful, devoted and pious.

In accordance with the all-encompassing wishes and the sovereign
will of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, my sister, Rafí‘ih Khánum, married Áqá ‘Abdu’r-
Rasúl Mansur [Kashání] in ‘Akká and from this union four children were
born, two boys and two girls: Áqá Ibráhím, Áqá Badí‘, Bihját Khánum,

13 At ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s urging, ‘Adasiyyih was settled by a number of Bahá’ís from
Yazd and its vicinity. For the most part, these believers were of Zoroastrian
background, but because they were experienced farmers, their presence in the
region dominated by Sunnis created almost no tension. This village is on the west
bank of the Jordan River, in the present day Jordan.

and Vidád Khánum.14 By the blessed instructions of the Guardian of
God’s Cause – may my life be a sacrifice unto his dominion – this family
also migrated from the Holy Land to Tehran. It was some time after
their arrival that Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl passed away, leaving this transient
world for the everlasting abode. Afterwards, my sister and her daughters
pioneered to America, and consequently were able to be pioneers twice.
Blessed are those who attain unto this!

One of the children of this servant was Nabíhih, who contracted
heart illness and passed away in Tehran. I implore the Almighty to
immerse her in the ocean of His forgiveness.

[Rely Upon God]
During the time of my father, one day in ‘Akká, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was
passing through the Súq Abyad where our shop was situated.15 I had
engraved an exquisite calligraphy that read, “Tawakkaltu ‘ala’lláh”16 and
was hanging on the door. When His blessed gaze fell upon it, He greatly
praised it and remarked, “Tayakulta ‘ala’lláh.” His blessed purpose was
that a person must place his reliance in God under all conditions.

[Calligraphy]
When I was a child and had not reached [the age of] maturity, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá gave a gold lira coin to my uncle, Áqá Muhammad-Hasan, stating,
“Give this [as tuition] to the calligraphy teacher.” He had added, “If he
[Khalíl Shahídí] would practice, his calligraphy would be like Mishkín-
Qalam’s. He must practice constantly.” That essence of sanctity was well

14 According to the narrator’s son, Labíb Shahidí, it was Badí‘ Mansúr who urged
the preparation of the original document and took down Khalíl Shahidí’s dictations;
(private communication, November 2007.)
15 As-Suq al-Abyad, which means, the White Bazaar, is a known location to this day

and the present translator recalls often visiting this market over the years he lived in
the Holy Land. The house of Mírzá Músá, known as Áqá Kalím, was in that vicinity
and often visited by Bahá’u’lláh.
16 Lit., Rely upon God. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s response was a variant form of the same

Arabic word, and meant, “Trust in God.”

aware that in the future this servant would be immersed in work and
industry and would not have time to exercise my calligraphy.

[Confirmations]
One year, on the morning of the Ridván Festival, the Most Mighty
Branch of God, the Mystery of God, the Interpreter of the divine verses
and the Center of divine Covenant and Testament, was in the blessed
House of ‘Akká <p.15> and all the friends of God were in His presence
as well. This servant had attained unto this bounty also.

He spoke in relation to the significance of that day, and all were
immersed in the sweetness of the ocean of His utterance. At that time,
with utmost earnestness, in my heart I implored that sanctified essence
to bestow confirmation upon me. He then [concluded the gathering and]
said, “Fí amáni’lláh.”17

All the believers rose and began to put on their shoes, as none
would come into His blessed presence while wearing shoes. In addition,
none would depart until they were given their leave, nor would they
enter [into the room] until summoned, since otherwise was outside the
bound of propriety and good manners. Besides, the dignity of His
Person prevented [anyone from doing otherwise].

As we were leaving His blessed room, suddenly He rose and came
outside the room as well. He placed His blessed right hand on the chest
of this unworthy servant and three times resonantly stated, “You are
successful; you are confirmed!” His repetition was as emphasis; that is to
say, “Be assured that you are successful and confirmed.”

Evidences of this utterance have ever since been thoroughly
visible, evident and clear to this servant, and undoubtedly will surround
me for the rest of my days as well. I implore His sacred Threshold to
sustain and confirm me in the Realm Above, and to deal with this
evanescent and lowly servant with His bounties and never-ending favors,
and to immerse me in the ocean of His absolution. In this regard, I am in
need of prayers.

17   Lit., Be under God’s protection; a form of Middle Eastern farewell.

[A Visit to Haifa]
When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was residing in Haifa, I attained His presence less
frequently. One day I went from ‘Akká for the sole purpose of attaining
His presence and when I arrived, out of compassion, grace and bounty,
He inquired, “Did you have something to discuss?” I said simply, “I
longed to see You.” He replied, “Any time you are in that state, you
should come.” He then added, “Stay here tonight.” I responded, “But it
might be an imposition.” He did not say anything; however, from His
blessed countenance it was evident that He was pleased with this
servant’s consideration.

[Memorization of the Writings]
Sometimes the beloved Master would instruct this servant to chant
prayers or recite Tablets.

One day, He was in the blessed House of ‘Akká and this
ephemeral being was going towards the House in order to attain His
presence, when from the upper window His vision fell upon this servant
and motioned me by hand to go into His blessed presence. After I
gained audience, He stated, “From now on, whatever you chant must be
from memory.” I bowed.

[Lawh Istiqámat]
The first Tablet that I began to memorize was a Tablet by the Blessed
Beauty about firmness, constancy and fortitude in the divine Covenant
and Testament, and it begins with these words, “He is the Holy, the Most
Glorious. O ye servants of the Merciful One! We admonish you to observe
trustworthiness, truthfulness and faithfulness, and to manifest the fear of God, the
Mighty, the Wise. Verily, he who holdeth fast to the fear of God is accounted among
those who occupy this sublime station.”18

The next time He [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] came from Haifa to ‘Akká and I
attained His presence, He instructed me to chant, and I recited this
Tablet.
18The cited lines are the opening passage of Bahá’u’lláh’s Lawh Istiqámat [Tablet of
Constancy]; see appendix 1.

Siyyid ‘Alí Afnán, who in those days was constantly vacillating in
his convictions, that is, for a while he associated with the thábitín
[faithful friends] and at other times with the náqizín [violators of the
Covenant], and whose story of infidelity is thoroughly told in the history
texts of the Cause, was in His presence on this occasion as well.19 As I
was chanting this Tablet, the following verse was reached: <p.20> “Can
it be possible that after the dawning of the day-star of Thy Testament above the
horizon of Thy Most Great Tablet, the feet of any one shall slip in Thy Straight
Path?”20 This sentence was a reference to the Center of the divine
Covenant and Testament.21

In short, when I reached this verse, [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] stated, “Áqá
Siyyid ‘Alí, do you hear what is revealed?” He then instructed, “Recite
this part again.” I chanted again. ‘Abdu’l-Baha restated, “Áqá Siyyid ‘Alí,
this is a verse of the Blessed Beauty! It is not my saying! Recite again.” I
recited the sentence a third time and He emphasized, “These are the
Words of the Blessed Beauty and not mine.” I then proceeded to chant
the rest of the Tablet. Afterwards, He said, “Marhabá!”

The news of this Tablet spread so famously that the Guardian of
the Cause of God memorized it at that time, and chanted it in a
gathering of the friends.

One day in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, this servant recited this
Tablet in the pilgrim house of the Shrine of the Báb [in Haifa], and He
remarked, “Give this Tablet to Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí to translate.”22

The Hájí did as bidden, but it was a literal rendering and when he
began to read it in His blessed presence, it did not meet with His
approval, since His purpose by translation was that the principal intent
be disclosed and divulged.

19 Siyyid ‘Alí Afnán was a son-in-law of Bahá’u’lláh and caused enormous difficulties
for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and others. For details, see, Afnán, Memories of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, (Trans. Ahang Rabbani), chapter 6; and Afnán, In the Land of Refuge:
The Genesis of the Bahá’í Faith in Shiraz, (trans. Ahang Rabbani), appendix 6.
20 Translation by Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p. 250.
21 At this point, the author gives a translation of this verse in Persian. Due to its

redundancy, this sentence has been omitted in the present translation.
22 Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet is in Arabic and presumably was not understood by most

Iranian Bahá’ís, who do not read Arabic.

From then on, with utmost enthusiasm, I would devote my leisure
hours to memorizing Tablets, divine verses and prayers.

[Visiting the Shrines]
One of the days of the week was devoted to visiting the blessed Shrine
[of Bahá’u’lláh], and that day was Sundays. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would be at
Bahjí, in the pilgrim house of the blessed Shrine. The friends of God in
‘Akká would visit the blessed Shrine [of Bahá’u’lláh] in the afternoon of
that day and the friends in Haifa would visit the Shrine of the Exalted
One [the Báb].

On that day, the friends of ‘Akká had won the bounty of visiting
the Shrine in His august presence [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], and He would
always remark, “Know the preciousness of these days!” From this
blessed expression, it was clear and evident that the eye of the world
would never again witness days such as these.

That night, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stayed in Bahjí and He instructed this
servant to remain in His presence. Until we retired for the night and our
rest, in accordance with His wish, the hours of the night were devoted to
chanting sacred verses and prayers. Afterwards, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to the
late Áqá Siyyid Abú’l-Qásim Khurásání, who in those days was the
custodian of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, and later, during the blessed
ministry of the Guardian of God’s Cause, succeeded in attaining to the
service of the custodianship of the Shrine of the Exalted One [the Báb],
to appoint a place for this servant to sleep. He emphasized, “Make sure
he is comfortable and does not catch cold.”

In the morning, after having breakfast, I was given my leave.

[Siyyid Abú’l-Qásim Khurásání]
The aforementioned Áqá Siyyid Abú’l-Qásim [Khurásání] was a most
faithful, devoted and sincere person. He passed away unexpectedly by
the Shrine of the Exalted One. The Guardian of the Cause of God –
may my spirit be a sacrifice unto his fidelity – was so saddened that for
three days he refused food. He would say, “My sight was not on his
service, but on his faith, certitude, sincerity and detachment.” The

Greatest Holy Leaf, may my spirit be a sacrifice for her meekness, would
say, <p.25> “You cannot imagine what an exalted station Áqá Siyyid
Abú’l-Qásim has attained in the world above!”

In accordance with instructions given to him, Áqá Siyyid Abú’l-
Qásim would spend the nights for protection [of the Shrines] at the
Mansion of Bahjí, and later at the Shrine of the Exalted One, but out of
respect would not consider it permissible to sleep freely, and would sit in
a corner until the morning. This was just an example of the immensity of
his goodly character.

One day in ‘Akká, he related for this servant:

> One of the eminent Jewish leaders [rabbis] had attained the
> sanctified presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Bahjí, and His blessed
> utterances were soaring in regard to the truth of Jesus and
the Messenger of God [Muhammad].

Out of his intense prejudice, that religious leader
recited a poem that he had in memory:

This with a bell peals out the chimes,

that lifts his voice from a towered height.
Each one proclaims his faith is true:

I wish I knew which one was right!23

By “This with a bell peals out the chimes,” and “that
> lifts his voice from a towered height,” he meant the religions
> of Jesus and Muhammad. Through this poem, he wanted to
> convey that both were false [Prophets]. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
> immediately responded back with the lines,

This faith is true, that a delight!

and yet the mob, an ugly sight,
Protested it with all their might!

I wish I knew which one was right!24

23   The original Arabic lines are:

> Hádhá bi-náqúsin yarinn, * wa dhá ‘alá ma’dhinin yasíh.

Kullun yusahhihu dínuh: * yá layta shi‘rí ma’s-sahíh!

However, while He was saying, “and yet the mob, an
> ugly sight,” He was pointing to him with His blessed hand,
> meaning, “You are that ugly sight who denies these two
> Dispensations.” Naturally, the man lost his composure and
> was irritated. However, once more [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] dealt with
> him softly and with kindness, until he recovered.

Three days after the passing of Áqá Siyyid Abú’l-Qásim, the
Guardian of the Cause of God instructed several of the friends in Haifa
to visit and take flowers to his resting-place. I was charged with reciting
prayers at his grave.

The Guardian would state, “Flowers should not be placed on the
casket; rather, after burial, place them on the gravesite.”

[Custodianship of the House of ‘Abbúd]
One day, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá summoned this servant from ‘Akká to Haifa.
After I attained His presence and received expressions of His kindness
and bounty, He said, “Many desire to reside in the blessed House [of
‘Abbúd], but I have chosen you from among the friends. Go and reside
in the House, but consider yourself the servant of the House, not its
resident.”

Therefore, that day we transferred our residence to the House,
that is, with my mother and brothers, Adíb and Dávud, we resided in the
House [of ‘Abbúd] and placed this crown of honor on our heads.
Whenever the pilgrims would come to pay homage [to the House], we
would stand to serve them and arrange for their comfort. On many
occasions, members of the Holy Household would come for a visit and
spend some time there. Moreover, at times, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá or the Greatest
Holy Leaf – the Liege Lady of the people of Bahá – would come also,
and on such excellent hours all of us would arise to serve them.

24   The original lines are:

> Hádhá sahíhun hádhá malíh; * wa-lákinna’l-qawma’l-qabíh
> Sára yunádí wa yasíh! * Yá layta shi‘rí ma’s-sahíh

One day around noon, I returned to the House from work. On
arrival, my gaze fell upon the beauteous countenance of the beloved
Master, Who was sitting at the lunch table. At that moment, I was deeply
perturbed that I had not been informed of His blessed arrival, even
though my mother had prepared all the necessary provisions for lunch.
Nevertheless, I was sad that I had not been there to welcome Him. That
Essence of Holiness had asked of this unworthy servant from my
mother and she had replied, “He is not aware of the Master’s visit.”

[The Master]
During the days of His blessed Person, all the friends would refer to
‘Abdu’l-Bahá as Sarkár Áqá [the Master]. The Ancient Beauty, exalted is
His mighty mention, would refer to Him as Áqá. And if someone would
refer to another of the Aghsán other than ‘Abdu’l-Baha <p.30> as Áqá,
Bahá’u’lláh would state, “There is only one Áqá. That is, the appellation
Áqá belongs solely to the Most Mighty Branch.”

[The Covenant-Breakers]
In short, [that day at lunch], when I came into the room, I immediately
bowed [to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], and He saw me and said, “Bismi’lláh, Áqá
Khalíl. Come, sit and partake of lunch.” I saw that Subhí25 was also
sitting on the right side of the Master and a chair was empty on His left.
[‘Abdu’l-Baha] said, “Sit.” So, I sat on the chair to His left.

Suddenly and immediately, [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] remarked, “Khalíl, you
know that for fifteen years I tolerated ‘Abdu’l-Karím and he thought that
I was unaware of his deeds.” Then He turned His blessed Visage to
Subhí and said, “If the entire world were to array [itself before Me], they
would be helpless to take a hair from my head.” Three times, He
repeated, “My succor and support is the Blessed Beauty!” He uttered
these words so resonantly and powerfully that the entire Blessed House
was vibrating by its effect!

‘Abdu’l-Karím that was mentioned [by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] was known
as Ustád ‘Abdu’l-Karím Kharrát [turner] and was from Isfahan. This
person secretly and stealthily associated with the Covenant-breakers, and
in truth was their spy. When the marble sarcophagus destined to contain
the sacred remains of His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb] – may my
soul be a sacrifice unto His pure blood – arrived from India to Haifa,
and was in process of being moved to the Shrine of the Exalted One,
and interred in its permanent and lasting spot, one of the individuals
who outwardly was serving this purpose was the same ‘Abdu’l-Karím.

25 Faydu’lláh Muhtadí, known as Subhí, a son of Áqá Muhammad-Husayn, was
related to Bahá’u’lláh’s third wife, Gawhar Khánum. He was a secretary of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá for some ten years and later sided with ‘Abdu’l-Husayn Áyatí, known as
Ávárih, and opposed Shoghi Effendi. For many years, he vacillated in his
convictions; each time would repent, only to resume his opposition later. In a letter
dated 26 December 1928, Shoghi Effendi explains, “Regarding Subhí’s situation, his
acceptance and return is conditioned and requires that he should write, in utmost
clarity, in his own hand and his own words, a confessional and admission letter
similar to his recent letter to the National Spiritual Assembly [of Iran]. This letter
should then be distributed among the friends, so all would learn of his change of
condition and for it to serve as means of repentance to the enemies of the Cause.”

At that time, [Mírzá] Majdi’d-Dín was one of the pillars sustaining
the violators of the Covenant, and according to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
description he was the teacher of Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí (the arch-
Covenant-breaker). This person [Majdi’d-Dín] had hidden behind the
olive trees, so that at an opportune time ‘Abdu’l-Karím would guide and
allow him enter and survey the condition and situation of the Shrine of
the Exalted One.

Therefore, at noon, when the servants working there had
dispersed for their lunch break, ‘Abdu’l-Karím thought it timely, and
with hand-signal motioned [Mírzá] Majdi’d-Dín, beckoning him to enter
the Shrine of the Exalted One. He had immediately entered [the Shrine]
and seen all that he wanted to survey and became closely aware of the
details.

It so happened that at that moment the custodian of the Shrine of
the Exalted One, Áqá Rahmatu’lláh, who was from Najaf-Abad in
Isfahan, had noticed this scene and quickly informed [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. On
hearing of this incident, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had instantly expelled26 him
[‘Abdu’l-Karím], and from then he had openly joined the Covenant-
breakers.

After his death, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “For three days and
nights, his soul was suspended between earth and heaven and did not
know where to go.”

This was only a sample of his deeds and behaviors. The rest can be
ascertained by the same pattern.

In short, in consideration that, like him, Subhí also secretly
associated with the ill-wishing Covenant-breakers and carried out
oppositions, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was deeply disappointed with him. He had
even imitated His blessed signature [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá].27 At the time
[lunch hour] when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was severely rebuking him, he seemed
dead, as if his soul had left his body.

26The original tard also implied excommunication.
27The implication might be that Suhbí had forged documents, perhaps Tablets, in
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s hand.

At all events, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spent that night in the House [of
‘Abbúd], but His blessed condition had become disturbed over this
incident and part of the night He was ill.28

Some time later, he [Subhí] was dismissed and sent to Iran [by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. In Tehran he joined the enemies of the Cause, and his
end was naught but manifest loss.

[A Note by the Narrator]
It should be clear to the esteemed readers that these recollections are
composed without any preliminaries or conclusions, or citing specific
dates. This is because the passage of time and days has robbed this
servant of that ability. However, the events recorded, or those that will
be recounted, are mentioned without any addition or loss. Due to the
passage of time, I may have forgotten some small details of certain
incidents, and therefore have not recorded those events [in this
narrative], nor will they appear in the subsequent pages.

[Remains of the Báb]
<p.35> When the sacred remains of His Holiness the Exalted One [the
Báb] – may my soul be a sacrifice unto His meekness – arrived from Iran
to Haifa, and that region and the Holy Land became light upon light, this
mighty glad-tidings had not been shared with the beloved friends of
God. In ‘Akká, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “If I were to tell you what happy
tidings I bear, old men would dance in joy alone in their rooms! But I
cannot disclose it.”

From one direction, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s blessed will had decreed to
cheer the friends’ hearts that had been saddened and made sorrowful
from wave after wave of the Covenant-breakers’ [misconduct], but from
another direction, wisdom did not permit its disclosure at that time.
However, this blessed statement [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] brought great joy and
happiness to each one of the friends of God.

28Mu’ayyad, Eight Years Near ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: The Diary of Dr. Habíb Mu’ayyad, (Trans.
Ahang Rabbani), extensively discusses how the conduct of the Covenant-breakers
would impact and impair ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s health.

[Iran]
One night there was a gathering in the blessed House of ‘Akká, and the
friends of God were in the presence of Him round Whom all the names
revolve [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. He remarked, “A day will come when the people
of Iran will go to bed as Muslims and wake in the morning all Bahá’ís!”
His blessed purpose [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] was that Iran [unreadable] would
enter beneath [the banner] of the Cause of God.

[Diffusion of the Faith]
During the days of the Guardian of the Cause of God, an [annual]
gathering was organized in the shadow of the Shrine of the Exalted One
to commemorate the ascension of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and many friends from
different regions would be in attendance and beholding the blessed
countenance [of the Guardian]. The blessed utterances [of Shoghi
Effendi] were:

> When a century that has passed from the Manifestation of
> the Primal Point [the Báb], the world will become spiritual,
> and people will embrace and associate with the divine
> religion. However, a century after the Appearance of
> Bahá’u’lláh, the world will become the divine paradise, and
> the promise in the sacred Qur’an, “Will enter the Cause of
> God by troops,”29 will stand fulfilled.30

[Iran’s Future]
One day a group of the friends of God was in the presence of the
Guardian of the Cause of God in the pilgrim house of the Shrine of the
Exalted One. He spoke words to this effect: “Iran, particularly Tehran,

29 Qur’an 110:2 reads, “And thou seest mankind entering the religion of God in
troops.
30 Most likely a reference to the conclusion of the Ten-Year Crusade, 1953-63,

which witnessed the spread of the Bahá’í Faith to all regions of the globe.

will also greatly advance from the point of view of economics,
commerce, agriculture and industry.”

[Visit to the Shrines]
In consideration that the Jews who had come from abroad to the Holy
Land, and who would come with the utmost courtesy, reverence,
cleanliness and refinement on a visit to the Shrines of Bahá’u’lláh and the
Exalted One, the Guardian of the Cause of God would remark on such
occasions: “They are very luminous, even though we have not spoken
with them [about the Faith]. If we were to discuss the Cause, there
would be upheaval between the two factions of the Jews and the Arabs.
However, the time for it will come. They are presently engaged in
organizing their affairs. Later they will arise in service to the Cause. Now
is the beginning of exaltation of the Jews and the beginning of the
abasement of Islam. ‘Truly thy Lord will decide between them on the day
of resurrection concerning that in which they differed.’31”

His blessed purpose in quoting this sacred verse that has been
revealed in the Qur’an was to explain that the abasement of the Jews was
decreed to last until the Day of Resurrection, namely, until the Day of
the Manifestation of the promised Qá’ím. Therefore, that abasement had
now ended. He would add, “The Muslims will be humiliated far more
than the Jews. But their punishment is quick and then their abasement
will turn into glory.” His blessed point was that, unlike the Jews, their
disgrace would not last long as they will quickly enter the Cause of God
so they would be freed from humiliation.

[A Humorous Story]
There was a Christian priest in ‘Akká who regularly attained the presence
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. One day other Christians asked him, “What benefit
have you gained from visiting ‘Abbás Effendi so frequently?” He replied,
“Soon I will baptize ‘Abbás Effendi!” When this news reached His
[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s] blessed ears, He replied, “Very well. We will see
whether he baptizes us or we circumcise him.”
31   For comparison, see Qur’an 2:113, 10:93, 22:17 and 45:17.

It was not long thereafter <p.40> that the priest fell ill. No matter
what the doctors tried, it had no effect, and indeed he grew worse.
Eventually it was decided that a team of doctors would consult on his
condition. Those doctors decided to examine him and consulted on his
situation and when they completed their examination, they prescribed
that no remedy except circumcision would cure him. After they decided
conclusively on this, they carried out the surgery.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá – may my life be a sacrifice unto His will – would
smile and say, “I made that comment in humor.”

Subsequently, whenever that priest would come before Him, he
was most embarrassed and would keep his head low. It became clear
from this incident that the Manifestations of Truth33 do not jest with
anyone, since their humor is also serious.34

[Shaykh Mahmúd, the Muftí]
There was a certain person in ‘Akká by the name of Shaykh Mahmúd
‘Arrabí. According to the sayings of the earlier and elder believers, he
was a most courageous and brave man, such that all inhabitants of ‘Akká
and the surrounding regions feared him.

One day he saw ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Jámi‘ Jazzár [Mosque of al-Jazzár]
performing His ablutions. He [came forth and] stated, “You are the Son
of God.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “That is what you say.” Once more,
he stated the same thing, only to be given the same answer. This time,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá added, “O Shaykh Mahmúd, have you not read the Qur’an,

32 Often the narrator uses the term smile in place of laugher.
33 Haqq, an Arabic word meaning truth, is often used in Islamic and Bahá’í writings
to refer to God. It also means righteous and the quality of Ultimate Reality in
mysticism. Haqq is one of the 99 Names of God found in the Qur’an. In the Tablet
of the Branch, Bahá’u’lláh writes of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: Verily, He is the remembrance of
God amongst you and His trust within you, and His manifestation unto you and His
appearance among the servants who are nigh.”
34 This story is also told in: Mu’ayyad, Eight Years near ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: The Diary of Dr.

Habíb Mu’ayyad, (Trans. Ahang Rabbani), chap. 6.

‘Honor thy guests though they be infidels’?”35 As soon as the Shaykh
heard this verse, his anger subsided, and since outwardly ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
had not met him [previously], nor heard of his name, this incident greatly
added to his wonder.

Later on, he fervently came into the blessed presence [of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá] and eventually embraced the Cause, attaining deep faith and
certitude. Moreover, his whole family came under the canopy of the
Cause.

I have heard that during the month of Ramadan, he [Shaykh
Mahmúd] had spread a feast in ‘Akká’s bazaar and was offering food to
every passer-by. When this news reached the blessed ears [of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá], He quickly summoned him and strongly forbade him this
conduct. He had asked, “Is it not true that the laws have changed?”
[‘Abdu’l-Bahá] responded, “Yes, but wisdom is required. Now is not the
time.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would remark, “I can convert the entire population
of ‘Akká in three days, but the harm [of doing this] exceeds the benefit.”

At all events, one day this person [Shaykh Mahmúd] had
submitted to His blessed presence [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], “I wish to give
surety to the government for the dairy animals36 and receive them from
the farmers at the harvest time.” However, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá did not deem
this agreeable and had prohibited him from so doing.

Nevertheless, he had thought that such dealings were worldly and
financial matters and not of spiritual affairs, and therefore he had
considered his own knowledge superior, particularly since he anticipated
that considerable profit could be gained through this undertaking. In
short, he acquired the right to the dairy animals for a fixed and specified
surety, on the condition that upon collection and gathering, he would
pay that sum to the government. However, after commencing this
undertaking, he realized that a grievous and irreparable loss had occurred

35 Probably from the hadith (“sayings”) of Muhammad. However, there is a related
verse of the Qur’an: 4:86, “When ye are greeted with a greeting, greet ye with a
better than it or return it. Lo! Allah taketh count of all things.”
36 The original is not clear on this word, and it can be read in two different ways:

either as dairy animals or one-tenth (which presumably would be the farming tax).
When the original manuscript is made available to researchers, this word should be
checked more closely.

and discovered that he was unable to reimburse his large debt to the
government. When he found himself perplexed and remorseful in this
situation, it became evident to him that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s knowledge was
not bounded, nor specified [to certain matters], nay, it encompassed the
whole of universe and creation and nothing remained concealed from
Him, nor will it ever remain so.

He then attained ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence <p.45> and threw his
corpulent body on His blessed feet and fervently cried and lamented [in
repentance]. With the utmost compassion and mercy, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, that
manifestation of kindness and grace, gently lifted him up, so that later,
[the Shaykh] had reported, “Despite my large body, I was like a tender
bird in His blessed hands!” To the extent possible, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, that
embodiment of benevolence and sympathy, had assisted him financially
until he was able to recover.

At one time, locust attack had enveloped the region to the point
that not a shred of greenery could be found. Shaykh Mahmúd ‘Arrábí
owned a large olive grove outside the city of ‘Akká. He came to the
blessed presence [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] and stated, “I want to go and see the
condition of the orchard.” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] replied, “Your olive trees are
safe from the locusts. There is no need to go.”

However, after two or three days, as he was anxious [about the
trees], he mounted his horse intending to inspect his grove. However, as
he rode, he observed that a thick cloud of locust, like a resolute army,
followed him. When he came close to the grove, he saw that the trees
were verdant and green, but about to be attacked by the locusts and to
be destroyed. He instantly grew repentant and remorseful of having
acted contrary to His blessed advice and will, and quickly turned his
steed around. As he turned back, the locusts also followed, and as such,
his trees remained intact. This incident greatly increased his faith and
certitude.

[Khalíl ‘Arrábí]
After he passed away, his children and descendants stood ready to serve,
and, due to their presence, the enemies of the Cause were powerless to
rebel to some degree. During the World War [I], one of his sons known

as Khalíl ‘Arrábí, who had a family, had gone to one of the villages of
‘Akká, named Kuwaykat, in search of food, but had been unsuccessful.
On his return from the village, his path came by [the Mansion of] Bahjí.
That day, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá – may my spirit be a sacrifice for His sacred
tomb – was in the pilgrim house situated next to the Shrine of
Bahá’u’lláh. He instructed the aforementioned Áqá Siyyid Abú’l-Qásim
Khurásání to go wait on the road so that upon arrival he would invite
[‘Arrábí] to His presence. Khalíl ‘Arrábí was deeply astonished that
without being outwardly aware of his journey or plans, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had
summoned him to His presence in this manner.

In short, he attained the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and since it was
noon, he was invited to table for lunch. However, worried over the
condition of his children, he was deeply perturbed and unable to eat.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, however, consoled and assured him. After lunch, He
bestowed a finger-length stack of gold lira coins to him, saying,
“Whenever these are spent, come and I will give you more,” and then he
was given his leave.

It must be obvious what state came over him. In truth, he was
ready to offer his life [for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. Upon his return to ‘Akká, he
first bought a basket full of bread, which was the necessary sustenance,
and then with great joy went home. Afterward, he invited a number of
relatives and said to them, “This plentiful feast is because of the
generosity and bounties of His Holiness ‘Abbás Effendi.” <p.50> He
then told them of the events.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Chant]
One day, this servant and two or three other of the friends were in the
presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Bahjí. After attaining to our true purpose
and beholding the peerless countenance of our Beloved, we were given
our leave. However since we had not visited the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh –
though we had achieved and attained the essence of visitation – this
servant inquired, “Do You grant us permission to visit the Shrine [before
leaving]?” He instantly rose, took a few steps, and replied, “Visiting [the
Shrine] does not require permission.”

After we had illumined our faces by the effulgence of the Sacred
Threshold, His blessed Person chanted the Tablet of Visitation with a
melody that will never again be heard for the rest of eternity. Upon
coming out of the Shrine, we were given our leave.

My paternal uncle, Áqá Muhammad-Hasan, related that after the
ascension of the Ancient Beauty – exalted be His mighty mention – one
day the chant and melody of the Blessed Beauty was heard. Everyone
was most bewildered as to the source of this invocation when suddenly
they discovered that the tone of that Promised Manifestation was heard
from their laudable Master [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. However, He had
immediately changed the manner of His chant, as the intonation of the
Truth belongs solely to the Truth.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
My father, Ustád Abú’l-Qásim Shahídzádih, related: “One day when the
Blessed Beauty was strolling, I was in His presence. He remarked, ‘Áqá
Abú’l-Qásim, say [what you wish].’ In my heart, I said, ‘After the Blessed
Beauty, I see none other than the Most Mighty Branch of God worthy of
this station.’ He replied, ‘Marhabá!’”

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Return in December 1913]
On the day that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had returned from His journeys to western
countries, and had arrived and resumed residence in the blessed House
in Haifa, the friends in ‘Akká collectively hastened by the rail-train to
visit that Beloved of the horizons. We were so profoundly ecstatic that
uncontrollably we were laughing and crying, and while singing songs and
anthems, though it was contrary to wisdom, entered the blessed House
[of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. We learned, however, that the arch-Covenant-breaker
[Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí] and his collaborators were in the presence of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, but it was evident that their purpose was not godly.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was informed that the friends of ‘Akká had arrived. He
replied, “They should wait.”

Meanwhile, that pivot of rebellion37 had said [to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá],
“You return was delayed.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had replied, “Such was
decreed.” Every reader or hearer of this description can fathom with
what loathsome manner he had spoken these words in the presence of
the Center of the divine Covenant and Testament.

When they had observed ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s frailty and weariness
[because of the long journey], they had thought their goal was within
grasp and had given this glad tidings to one another. However,
afterwards, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “It is not as it seems,” and these
blessed words had greatly cheered the hearts of the people of Bahá,
causing them to spread feasts of thanksgiving and joy.

When [‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s] passing took place, the pivot of rebellion
and Covenant-breakers wanted to enter the blessed House [of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá], but by the instructions of the Greatest Holy Leaf, the Liege Lady
of the people of Bahá – may my life be a sacrifice unto her meekness –
the friends had prevented their entrance and offered some excuse.
Remorseful and downcast, they left.

In short, we have strayed far from our main story. After the
rapscallion Covenant-breakers had left the blessed presence, the friends
were summoned, and at that time, each of us reverently, humbly and
respectfully, prostrated ourselves on the ground and kissed ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s feet, alighted our eyes and gladdened and thrilled our hearts. That
hour was an hour that can never be described by words or otherwise.
“Exalted and lofty is that sanctified presence and that hallowed station.”

When He had asked after our health and showered us with His
bountiful expressions of favor and grace, He stated, “We went, sowed
seeds and now wait for the harvest.”

Thereupon, He bade us farewell by saying, “Fí amáni’lláh,” and we
left His presence. Praise be unto God that with our earthly eyes we
witnessed what hyacinths of <p.55> learning and divine recognition
have bloomed and blossomed across the world from those very seeds.

[The Mansion]
37 A reference to Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí, who in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament
is referred to as the center of sedition.

During the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the spiteful Covenant-breakers
even schemed for complete ownership of the Mansion of Bahjí. As such,
they approached certain individuals in the government offices who had
long years of experience, and tempted them into rendering influence in
this regard.

Included among them was a certain Turkish physician by the name
of Zakí Bayk, who exerted great efforts in this path. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came
face to face with him in one of the streets of ‘Akká and in Turkish said
to him, “Even if you swallow the Mansion like a mouthful, I will put my
hand down your throat and pull it out from your stomach!” From this
strongly worded censure, he recognized that all his efforts and exertions
would be futile, and therefore had sought through an intermediary to
appeal for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s forgiveness. [From this incident,] others grew
repentant as well.

There was a certain Shaykh Ibráhím ‘Akkí in ‘Akká, who was an
abúkatu, that is, he was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s attorney, and appointed to
undertake tasks associated with the Mansion [of Bahjí]. One day,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá went to see him in his residence in order to ensure that he
would not be tempted and influenced by the enemies [of the Cause].
However, he pretended to be ill. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked for Dr. Nikúlákí,
who was a Christian and a righteous man, to come. The physician came
at once and offered a prescription. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá instructed for the
[prescribed] medicine to be readied. When it was brought, He placed
gold coins stacking a finger-length next to the medicine and said [to
Shaykh Ibráhím], “Take whichever of these two is the remedy of your ill,
but the affairs of the Mansion must be concluded satisfactorily.” With
that, He left, and afterwards [Shaykh Ibráhím] said, “Not Moses, not
Christ and not Muhammad!” He meant that none of these
Manifestations wielded the scepter of authority as His blessed Person
did!

[Attempts on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Life]
Dr. Nikúlákí Bayk was the physician of the Holy Family. Previously in
his youth he had served as a physician in the Ottoman military. The
Covenant-breakers had asked him to poison ‘Abdu’l-Bahá during the

course of his examination, but he quickly informed and exhorted [the
Holy Family], ensuring that not a moment was neglected in ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s protection. Afterwards, for a while even ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s food was
prepared separately, in a special, secure38 room.

The Covenant-breakers had even asked ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Christian
coachman, a certain Rúhanná, to derail His carriage in a ravine on the
way to Bahjí. They had given him some money beforehand and
promised to give a substantial sum after the execution and completion of
their plan. However, once the carriage had deviated a little from the main
path, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá vehemently shouted, and spoke with great intensity,
inquiring of his intention. Being frightened and having lost his will-
power, [the coachman] confessed to the plan and later was discharged.

Thereupon, Isfandiyár who had been trained by him [the
Christian] was appointed the faithful coachman. He passed away in the
blessed house [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] in Haifa during the ministry of the
Guardian of the Cause of God.

[Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí]
During the days of rebellion of the violators of the Covenant, the arch-
Covenant-breaker [Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí] had said, “‘Alí had the right,
but it was ‘Umar who exerted and succeeded.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá – may my
spirit be a sacrifice unto Him – sent word to him, “Neither do you have
the courage of ‘Umar, nor am I like ‘Alí who remained silent and still.”
He added, “What I write in Persian, he copies in Arabic and what I write
in Arabic, he reproduces in Persian.” From this blessed remark [of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá] it was evident that he [Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí] was bereft
of qualities and indeed was no more than a cover [for others]39.

Presently also an ignorant one40 is found that similar to the arch-
Covenant-breaker and the pivot of sedition, commits such treacherous
deeds, stringing certain phrases from the divine verses and heavenly

38 Original dar-bastih, implies that the room was locked from within.
39 The word qishr, translated as cover, also refers to a person concerned with the
outward form of religious law, who disregards or is unaware of their true intent.
40 bí-daráyat has been translated as ignorant. However, technically it refers to the

science of distinguishing true from false prophetic hadith.

Tablets and calls them revealed verses and tablets; or imitates certain
prophecies and divinations about future events that occur in the Writings
and attributes them to himself.41 <p.60> He even has introduced
bewildering and strange interpretations of the laws and evident verses
which have been sent down from the heaven of Bahá by the King;
whereas evident laws are beyond interpretation and elucidation. He has
thought that in this way he would win victories and triumph. But alas,
alas, to vain imaginings.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá would state, “What I state in accordance with the
needs and the requirements of the time, Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí (the
Covenant-breaker) repeats the exact same in unsuitable and
inappropriate places, and therefore his words have no effect.”

There was a certain lawyer in ‘Akká by the name of Shaykh
‘Abdu’r-Rahman ‘Azízí, who in a gathering had spoken words that
previously ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had said to him. Even though he was a non-
Bahá’í, [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] censured him for this. Indeed no treachery can be
imagined greater than this: that a person, because of his own false and
corrupt imaginings, attributes to himself words spoken by others,
particularly when those words and remarks have streamed from the will
and tongue of the All-Merciful.

In short, this unenlightened and spiteful imitator [Mírzá
Muhammad-‘Alí], who was the pivot of rebellion, eventually became
blind and sightless, and in the utmost misery and rejection left this world
for the lowest abyss. “Be warned and repentant ye the men of pride,
false imagination and imitation!”

One of the pillars of the Covenant-breakers brought a quantity of
divine verses and Tablets to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, thinking that he had
marshaled proofs [against ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], but without even looking at
them, [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] stated, “Throw away these scraps of papers, as
what I say is final!” His blessed intent was that they must come beneath
the divine Covenant and Testament.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, “Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí (the arch-
Covenant-breaker) has one happy thought, and that is that after Me it

41The original text mixes singular and plural and, therefore, it is unclear whether a
specific person or a group of opponents of the Faith is being discussed.

will be him.42 However, with my own hands I will shroud and bury him.”
After His blessed ascension, one of the Covenant-breakers by the name
of [Mírzá] Mustafa Abú-Hurayrih43 had said to Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl
Mansúr, who passed away in Tehran, “What happened to that statement
that He [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] said He would shroud and bury Mírzá
Muhammad-‘Alí with His own hands?” He responded, “O wretched
one! What shrouding and burying is greater than replacing him with a
youth!”44

One time, [Mírzá] Majdi’d-Dín, who was the main pillar of the
Covenant-breakers, attained the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for a certain
purpose. After considerable admonishments and counsels, the blessed
tears of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá poured out, because He was disheartened over the
deeds and doings of the violators of the Testament. Majdi’d-Dín,
however, quietly started to laugh, presumable thinking how powerful and
skillful he was to have brought tears to His blessed Person. Suddenly,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “I weep over your condition and you laugh! Get up
and leave!” With anger and fury, he was thrown out.

One time Mírzá Badí‘u’lláh, the brother of the arch-Covenant-
breaker, returned, and according to his own reckoning repented, the
details of which are available in history books of the Faith. When he saw
that he would not be able to achieve his true purpose or realize his vain
imaginings, once again he raise rebellion and joined the Covenant-
breakers. His deeds and evil behavior reached such a point that he hid
seditious papers under the mattress and bed in the blessed bedroom [of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá], so that whenever the Investigation Committee sent on
behalf of the government – which came at the provocation of the
Covenant-breakers themselves – conducted a search, then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
would fall into trouble. However, since ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had instructed the
Household to carefully search and watch the room, therefore those
papers were found.

42 Bahá’u’lláh’s Kitáb ‘Ahd had ordained for Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí to assume
leadership after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. However, because he violated the Covenant, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá excommunicated him in His Will and Testament.
43 He had been an attendant of Bahá’u’lláh and named Abú-Hurayrih after a fickle

follower of Muhammad.
44 A short sentence appears to have been erased at this point.

Later ‘Abdu’l-Bahá excommunicated him [Mírzá Badí‘u’lláh]. He
had asked that a written statement <p.65> be given [by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá].
But He responded, “I said leave, then leave!” Everyone heard that.

One time, [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] took an oath, “By God, besides Whom
there is no other god! I will appear with the perspicuous serpent.45”
When He spoke that oath, my father, Ustád Abú’l-Qásim, was in His
blessed presence and was so thrilled and overjoyed on hearing this that
he kissed both blessed shoulders [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. His meaning by
“perspicuous serpent” was the blessed person of the Guardian of the
Cause of God, who, like a dragon, destroyed and obliterated all the
Covenant-breakers.

One of the inhabitants of ‘Akká was exhibiting great opposition.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “He needs a slap.” Next day that person died. It
was said to His blessed presence, “He received his slap,” but He did not
respond.

[Dietary Considerations]
There was a gathering in the blessed House of Haifa and the friends of
God were assembled around the One “round Whom all names
revolve,”46 and for some reason a discussion of watermelon took place.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “Watermelon is cool.” He then added, “His
Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb] would not eat humectants.
Whenever overcome by heat, He would pour a little lemon juice in water
and drink that beverage. This was the humectants of His Holiness the
Exalted One.”

He also stated, “His Holiness the Exalted One has said that if a
person spends two-thirds of his money on sweets, he has not spent
excessively.” From this statement it can be understood that man needs
sweets more than humectants or other food items.”

45 In ancient religions, serpents were often represented as potent guardians of
temples and other sacred spaces.
46 A title of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, often used in the original manuscript (though in most

instances it has been replaced with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá).

[The Fast]
One time ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “A person does not become corpulent
because of excessive eating.”

> The Guardian of the Cause of God used to fast without breakfast.

At the beginning, when wisdom in certain matters was most
necessary and essential, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would fast during Ramadan. It was
suggested to His blessed presence not to observe the [Muslim] fast.
However, He said, “Since people believe that I am fasting, if I do not
maintain it, then it would be a deceit.”

Even in Haifa, at times He would invite Muslim clergymen to the
guesthouse at the top of the Mount Carmel for the evening break of the
fast or to have breakfast [at the start of the fast]. However, all the food
was prepared in the blessed House [in Haifa]. At dawn, all the delicious
food that was prepared would be conveyed by carriage to the
aforementioned place by Khusraw, the servant of the blessed House, or
Isfandiyár, and be readied. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would not rest until the dawn.
After breakfast, in the company of the guests, He would descend Mount
Carmel. He would sustain all this toil and difficulty solely for the
protection of God’s Cause.

During the days of the Ancient Beauty – may His mention be
exalted – two or three of the friends acted unwisely during the month of
Ramadan. When this was mentioned before His sacred Presence, He
stated, “If both fasts are ordained, then what will occur?” That is, both
the Bayání and the Qur’anic fasts. The believers said to them [i.e. the two
or three Bahá’ís who had not observed the Islamic fast], “Do not act in
such a way that until the end of time people would curse you!” That is, if
the Blessed Beauty were to ordain both fasts, then you would have
caused it.

In short, later these observances were gradually reduced.

Nevertheless, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would not neglect wisdom. He would say,
“If by sunset the friends [i.e. Bahá’ís] have not reached their homes, then
they should quicken their pace.” His blessed purpose was so that no one
would think that they are not fasting.

Even some years during the Festivity of Sacrifice,47 He would
sacrifice sheep.

However, during the blessed days of the Guardian of God’s
Cause, such observances48 were completely eliminated. During one of
the Muslim festivals, several people in Haifa came by the entrance to the
blessed House to offer festival greetings. <p.70> However, he [Shoghi
Effendi] stated, “Tell them that this is not our festival.” They were
advised of the dates of Bahá’í festivals. In consideration of the
requirements of the period, the Guardian of the Cause of God had
willed that his precious time, which was strained due to the voluminous
work of the Cause, should not be spent on such unfruitful and
unprofitable persons.

[Feeding Haifa-‘Akká Area]
During World War [I] famine occurred, to the point that the poor and
hapless were dying of hunger. Not even salt could be found, and people
were forced to use sea-salt in its place.

That year, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá instructed the ‘Adasiyyih farmers, who
were mostly Bahá’ís of Zoroastrian descent, to expand their wheat
farming. With great zeal and determination, they began to plant. At the
height of summer and despite the intense heat of ‘Adasiyyih, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá proceeded to that region at the harvest time to ensure that the
necessary provisions for Bahá’ís and others were gathered.

The wheat was loaded on camels and sent to Haifa and ‘Akká.

However, the delivery of the grain was not easy, since people were
hungry [and would attack the caravan]. Only the power and influence of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was able to force the government to ensure protection of
the transfer [from ‘Adasiyyih]. In addition to all the Bahá’ís, so many
47  ‘Id-i Qurbán or ‘Id-i Adha, is a festival celebrated by the Muslims in
commemoration of Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son for God. This
festivity is four days long and begins on the 10th of Dhi’l-Hajjih, and on that day,
pilgrims to the Holy Shrines in Mecca and Medina offer a sacrifice, as do other
Muslims in other lands.
48 The word used for observance is hikmat, which is usually rendered as wisdom. The

implication is that such an observance of wisdom, which in this case resembles
dissimulation, no longer occurred.

others and the poor received their sustenance from the bounties and
favors of that benefactor [‘Abdu’l-Bahá].

However, the intense heat impaired ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s health. He
instructed that a canopy be made of thistles and water be sprinkled [on
the grounds] so He would rest a little under it.

The wheat harvest that year was most plentiful, to the point that
they could not collect it all from the farm, and next year grew again.

In those days, [one day] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was walking in a street. He
saw that a Christian from one of the villages was passing by along with
his young son. The lad was saying, “Father, I am hungry.” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
said to them, “Come with Me.” Together, they went to the blessed
House, and by His instructions, food was prepared and readied for them.
After they had eaten amply from the spread feast, He stated in effect,
“Lease a donkey and load a bag of flour, and conduct it to their home.”
That person [the Christian] was most puzzled, as he did not know
‘Abdu’l-Bahá from the past. However, after he had investigated he had
learned of His precious and blessed Person.

In short, this situation passed until the blessed ascension [of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá] occurred. When that person learned of this dark news, he
began to lament and wail with great intensity. When asked what had
provoked this intense emotion, he responded, “It was because of the
generosity and openhandedness of this sacred and sanctified Person that
we are alive today. Otherwise, my family and I would have died of
starvation and hunger.” He then recounted what had occurred.

One day the aforementioned Siyyid ‘Alí Afnán was at the blessed
dinning table [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. After the meal, he uttered, “Praise unto
God!” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked, “Why do you praise?” He responded, “In
consideration that we attained unto this bounty.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated,
“Praise should be offered when one satisfies the hunger of a hungry
person.”

[The Sea of the Cause]
One day ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to one of the pilgrims in Haifa, “Let us walk
a little.” They strolled to the port. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “Yesterday it
rained. The sea needed water. She accepted the clouds unto herself and

today the sea is surging forth. However, the sea of the Cause <p.75> has
not surged forth yet.” The point of His blessed Person was that when
the sea of the Cause has surged, then like this sea [of Haifa], it would
refuse to accept any filth. Accordingly, now that the Universal House of
Justice has been established, the sea of the Cause has flowed forth in a
way that is evident and manifest unto all.

There was a certain ‘Abbás-Qulí of Qum, who for some time
served as the custodian of the Shrine of the Exalted One [the Báb].
During the blessed days of the Guardian of the Cause of God, he passed
away by the Shrine of the Exalted One. He used to relate that one time
one of the Covenant-breakers had said to him, “Has the Blessed Beauty
not taught, ‘Consort with the followers of all religions’?49 Therefore, why
do you not associate with us?” He responded, “First tell me what
religion you follow, then we will associate with you!”

One day, this servant walked besides the blessed steed of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá from the Shrine of the Exalted One to the blessed House [of
Haifa]. Along the way, He spoke on certain matters. I mentioned the
above incident. He became very happy and smiled broadly. “Yes, indeed
it is so. It is revealed, ‘Consort with the followers of all religions except
the Covenant-breakers and hypocrites.’50”

49 The complete verse is, “Consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of
friendliness and fellowship;” (Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 21)
50 The present translator is not familiar with such a statement found in Bahá’u’lláh’s

Writings and it appears that it represented ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s interpretation. The word
munafiqín, meaning hypocrites, has Islamic roots and refers to those who were
outwardly with Muhammad, but disputed with His wishes. The following passage
from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 158)
further on the theme provided by the narrator: “O ye beloved of the Lord! The
Kingdom of God is founded upon equity and justice, and also upon mercy,
compassion, and kindness to every living soul. Strive ye then with all your heart to
treat compassionately all humankind – except for those who have some selfish,
private motive, or some disease of the soul. Kindness cannot be shown the tyrant,
the deceiver, or the thief, because, far from awakening them to the error of their
ways, it maketh them to continue in their perversity as before. No matter how much
kindliness ye may expend upon the liar, he will but lie the more, for he believeth you
to be deceived, while ye understand him but too well, and only remain silent out of
your extreme compassion.”

[The Guardian]
One day an illness had overcome the blessed person of the Guardian of
the Cause of God while in the blessed House of Haifa. When the
Greatest Holy Leaf – the Liege Lady of the people of Bahá – heard of
this, she rose from her seat and said, “I must go and see to the condition
of the blessed beauty.”51

The use of this appellation should not surprise the readers and
listeners, since the beauty of the Guardian of the Cause of God was the
same as the Blessed Beauty. He was the light of God and the nucleus of
refulgence of the Sun of Bahá’u’lláh. The point and purpose of the Liege
Lady of the people of Bahá was merely to make evident the station and
exaltation of the Guardian of the Cause of God through this statement.

[Remedy]
With her own blessed hands, the Greatest Holy Leaf used to prepare a
simple drop for eye ailments. To every ailing eye that this drop was
applied, it would be cured. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, “Khánum must
apply the drop with her own hands.” His blessed point was that the
reason for the cure was in her applying it [and not the drop].

If, for instance, a pregnant woman would attain the presence of
the Greatest Holy Leaf – the Liege Lady of the people of Bahá – out of
kindness and compassion, she would place her blessed hand on the
woman’s womb and smilingly would say whether the unborn child was a
boy or girl. Then she would suggest what name should be given. What
she predicted always occurred.

At times, out of benevolence and mercy, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would give
certain instructions to some that were sick, and [afterwards] perfect
health would be gained. However, the true cause of remedy and cure was
His blessed will.

My father had acquired a severe eye ailment. No medication
helped. One day, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came to our residence to inquire of his
health. My father was bedridden. After He observed the situation, twice
He said to him, “Close your eyes.” Then He moistened His fingers with
51   Jamál Mubarák, rendered as the Blessed Beauty, is a title used for Bahá’u’lláh.

His blessed mouth and rubbed it over my father’s eyes and said, “It is
nothing.” Not only his eyes gained perfect health, but also never again in
his entire life did he suffer from an eye ailment.

There was a certain inhabitant of ‘Akká whose name was ‘Abdu’l-
Mutallib, a son of a certain Mustafa-Dallál. He was devoted to ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. He acquired intense hiccups and no remedy was working. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá went to visit him in his home and to inquire of his health. He
noticed that hiccups would not let the man speak a word. He asked,
“Are there any apples here?” He was told, “It is not the season for
apples.” He said, “Someone should go to the House and search for one.”
An apple was found [in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s House] and brought to His
blessed presence. A corner of this apple had gone bad. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
instructed, “Eat the apple.” He ate a piece of the apple and his hiccup
subsided some. He continued eating the apple and his hiccup was
completely cured. He even started eating the apple core <p.80>, but
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to him, “There is no need to eat these.” However, he
ate it anyway, perhaps thinking that his cure was due to the apple. In
short, he was rescued from this intense ailment.

Such incidents would occur very often, each evidence of the might
and influence of His blessed Person. The Guardian of the Cause of God
used to say, “Whatever we have willed has occurred.” It is certain that
whatever the divine manifestations will, will occur since their will is
God’s will.

[Azal]
One night in ‘Akká we were all in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and He
was speaking of the unseemly deeds of Yahya Azal. In the course of His
description, He had to point to His index finger to demonstrate the
length and extent, and the story was as follows. He said, “One of Azal’s
sons had said that my father reveals verses and each word is this big.”
Smilingly He showed His index finger, meaning, the words are this long.

He related that Yahya Azal had said to the Blessed Beauty, “What
would we do if the true Qá’im appeared?” The Blessed Beauty had
smiled. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also smiled.

Even though the Satanic Tree has never taken root, nor will ever
do so, nevertheless this remark of his [Azal’s] was evidence of the falsity
of his claim and lack of convictions in the truth of the Blessed Beauty.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá would relate in essence, “Azal was most hairy. His
back was hairy like a bear.” In short, those that rose to extinguish the
perspicuous light, even their body was not without fault and defect.

After the honored Mishkín-Qalam, whose name is mentioned in
the history of the Cause, arrived in the Holy Land from the town in
Cyprus where Yahya Azal was residing, he related the following:

> One year there was no rain in Cyprus. People in that region
> were most disturbed. No matter how much they prayed,
> supplicated, visited various shrines, or engaged in entreaty in
> mosques and other places of worship, in hope that God
> would accept their appeal and open the gates of His Mercy
unto them, it bore no fruit.

At that time, Azal lived in a secluded room that had a
> high shelf. On this shelf, he had a bundle in which he kept a
> great quantity of papers, and had deep affinity towards these
> papers.52 I said to people who were praying [for rain], “If
> you want rain to come, at that location there is a bag full of
> papers containing many talismans. Bring down and burn
those papers, and immediately rain will descend.”

Immediately they hastened to that location [Azal’s
> apartment] and carried out my suggestion. No matter how
> much Azal cried and screamed, no one had paid any
attention to him.

At that moment, I turned my thoughts to the Blessed
> Beauty, and whispered, “O God, do not allow me to be
discredited. Manifest Thy power!”

Suddenly, a cloud with thunder and lightening
> appeared and filled the sky. So much rain poured that it
> nearly flooded.

52From the tone of the original, it appears that the bag contained Azal’s own
writings.

People were most thankful to me. They would say,
“We wish you had enlightened us sooner!”

[Mishkín-Qalam]
The honored Mishkín-Qalam was most humorous and clever. At one
time, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent him to Bombay53, but told him, “You will return
[to the Holy Land].”

While there, after some time, he became ill to the point that the
believers had lost hope for him to live through it. They even had
prepared the burial shroud and other necessities for his interment. When
he was at the door of death, the friends closed their shops and came
<p.85> to prepare for his burial.

At that time, the physician, out of desire for testing, suggested that
he be placed in a pool of hot water and massaged. As they were
massaging him, even though he was weak, with a very soft voice he
whispered, “Do not take your hand any lower; it will bite!” All that were
gathered burst into laughter and said, “He is not dying. Let us not waste
our time.” In short, he regained his health, and in perfect condition
returned to the Holy Land. The point is since ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had said to
him, “You will return,” then it was fulfilled.

After a long time, he passed away in ‘Akká in Khán Avamíd.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá came for the preparation of his burial. His burial place is in
the Bahá’í cemetery of ‘Akká.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “If Mishkín-Qalam did not have this wife,
then he would have lived a natural length of life.” From this blessed
utterance, it became evident that his wife was devoid of goodly
characters. That is, although she had passed away shortly before his
[Mishkín-Qalam’s] passing, nevertheless she had left undesirable effects
on him.

[On Life]

53 The name of the region is not perfectly readable and Bombay is the present
translator’s best guess.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, “Natural life is one-hundred twenty years. It can
be longer, but not shorter.”

The late Áqá Mírzá Áqá Khán Qá’im-Maqámí54 – upon him rest
God’s mercy and His paradise – used to say that when he was in the
presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, He had remarked, “A person may live for
one-hundred and fifty-five years, but not for one hour longer.”

[Bahiyyih Khánum’s Resting Place]
The Liege Lady of the people of Bahá went one day to visit the Bahá’í
Cemetery of Haifa. Later, in the presence of the Guardian of the Cause
of God, she stated, “I did not like it.” The point of her holiness was that,
after her passing, she did not wish her physical temple to be interred
there.

The Guardian of the Cause of God suggested the same location in
the vicinity of the Shrine of the Exalted One and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, which is
the eternal site of visitation of people of Bahá, and this suggestion
greatly pleased her sanctified person.

54He was a grandson of the renowned Abú’l-Qásim Qá’im-Maqám Faráhání, who
was mentioned by Bahá’u’lláh in the Kalimát-i Firdawsih. He was the first of Abú’l-
Qásim’s descendants to become a Bahá’í. For his biography see: Fádil Mázandarání,
Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 8, pp. 267-278. There are references to him also in
Taherzadeh, Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, vol. 4, pp. 222-26, and in Mehrdad Amanat,
Negotiating Identities: Iranian Jews, Muslims, and Baha’is in the Memoirs of Rayhan Rayhani
(1859-1939); PhD Dissertation; UCLA, 2006, p. 115: “Another critical account of
Baha’i efforts to convert Jews in Arak is significant in that it stresses the emotional
aspect, the Jews’ ‘ignorance’ and ‘simplemindedness,’ and divisions among Jewish
rabbis as contributing factors to the Baha’is’ success in attracting young Jewish
migrants. The description of Mirza Aqa Khan Qae’m-Maqam, an influential local
Baha’i landowner who offered an open invitation to his home and who personally
welcomed young Jewish migrants, echoes similar accounts of other Jews in Kashan
and Hamadan.” (Omid Ghaemmaghami, email communication, 23 November
2007\.)

[Sugar Shortage]
During World War [I], sugar-cubes could not be found, and most people
would drink their tea with raisin, or dry fig, or kharrub55 or its syrup, if
any of these could be found.

One day, a sugar loaf was presented to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He stated, “I
will not use it by myself.”

Next day, the believers in ‘Akká were summoned into His
presence in His house and He instructed that tea be served. The sugar
loaf was split, and each person received about the size of a sugar-cube.
Because of this kindness and generosity of His blessed Person, we were
all honored and thrilled. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “Place it to the left.” That is,
the left-hand side of the mouth. His blessed point was that on the left
side, unlike the right side, the sugar would not melt quickly. In truth, it
was as He indicated.

At all events, the conduct and deeds of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá were an
example to each person, so that we too would attain and be adorned
with such goodly and pure character and disposition.
55Better known as Kharnoub Tree in the Middle East, it is known as the Carob
Tree or Certatonia Siliqua in the West.

[Tea]
Regarding the preparation of tea, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, in essence,
“Tea must be brewed from one water.” That is, more water should not
be added.

> He would also say, “Tea is not harmed by one boiling.”
> In addition, “When tea is poured from the pot in a teacup for
testing, do not pour it back into the pot.” This blessed utterance was
only to preserve the fragrance and taste of the tea.

He would say, “Tea should not be poured into a saucer.56 If it is
hot, then one should wait a little for it to cool.” His point was that such
a practice is outside the bounds of cleanliness and delicacy.

[A Former Opponent]
There was a certain Hájí ‘Abbás in ‘Akká, originally from Baghdad. After
the Ascension of the Blessed Perfection, he joined the Covenant-
breakers and would conduct himself in accordance with the instructions
of the pivot of rebellion [Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí] and his followers. He
was ready and willing to slay ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, but the sovereignty of Truth
prevented him from carrying out his ill-intentions.

<p.90> During the final days of his life he had become old,
decrepit and ill.

When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá returned from His journeys to foreign
countries [in December 1913], he attained His blessed presence in one of
the streets of ‘Akká. In utmost humility and despondency, he submitted,
“I beg of You in the name of the Blessed Beauty to forgive me.”
‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “Come with Me.” He caressed his face and
added, “The past is past.”

Because he was handicapped, the Covenant-breakers had
previously agreed that each day they would bring his food to his house.
However, they were neglectful and when they brought some, it was not
much.
56In the east, it is not uncommon for tea to be poured from the teacup into a saucer
for it to cool, and then drunk from the saucer.

That day, when they [the violators of the Covenant] learned of his
return [to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s fold], they brought him a large basin of most
delicious food items. However, he completely refused, saying, “I have
nothing to do with you.” No matter how they pleaded and begged, it
bore no fruit. Helpless, they returned with the same food they had
brought – unsuccessful and failed.

Since he was ill, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá took him to Haifa, roomed in the
British hospital near the blessed House, and He would frequently visit
him. [On such visits,] He would offer gifts and money to others in the
hospital also. The believers would visit him [in the hospital] as well. This
servant visited him once also. From his face and appearance, it was
evident that from hell he had entered into paradise.

After a while, he passed away in the same hospital and left this
world with a good end.

The Covenant-breakers who sincerely would return [to the Faith],
and attain the sanctified presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, prostrate themselves
at His feet, kissing them, and cry and beg for forgiveness and pardon,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say to them, “The past is past,” and envelop them in
His kindness and mercy.

In truth, there is no pain or illness worse than violation of the
divine Covenant and Testament, since it brings darkness and is
suffocating. … “take refuge with God.”57

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Influence]
One of the friends of God was living in a village near ‘Akká, and over
the years had saved some capital through work and labor. He would lend
that money for interest to farmers in that region. However, they
schemed not to reimburse his principle. Of necessity, he mentioned the
situation to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

At that time, the deputy-governor was staying in that village to
attend to some governmental work. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, that essence of power
and might, wrote him a few words in this regard. Immediately upon the

57 In the copy of the manuscript used for the present translation, only a small
portion of the line at the bottom of page 92 was copied. Therefore, this sentence
represents the translator’s attempt at recovering a portion of that line.

receipt of this blessed communication, he arrested and imprisoned the
debtors and conditioned their release upon the full payment of their
debts. Because of this, they were compelled to repay immediately.

The inhabitants of that village said, “We did not know that ‘Abbás
Effendi has such influence and authority even outside of ‘Akká.”

One of the residents of ‘Akká was so distressed over the conduct
and deeds of his wife that he mentioned the situation in the presence of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, seeking a remedy. Consequently, his wife was summoned
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke to her words to this effect, “If you do not
change your behavior and conduct towards your husband, I will arrange
another wife for him.” It became evident that the purpose of the wife
had been to rob her husband of the confidence and ability to acquire
another wife.58 <p.95> However, the blessed remark [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
had made her plans transparent and made her change in such a way that
her husband expressed his satisfaction.

[Children’s Education]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was completely skilled and accomplished in swimming,
riding horses and shooting. He would say words to this effect, “Teach
children so that if it becomes necessary they will have the skills. They
should be accustomed to every food and bedding, so that if they
encounter difficulty and constraints, they would be able to endure the
situation.”

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Knowledge]

A young man in ‘Akká related to this servant, “Passing on a road, I
attained the presence of His Holiness ‘Abbás Effendi. He inquired,
‘Whose son are you?’ I mentioned my father’s name. His Holiness then
named my grandfather, my great grandfather and generation after
generation before them with such details and exposition that I was most
astonished and astounded.”

58It appears that a line at the bottom of page 94 was not photocopied in the
manuscript used for the present translation.

Indeed, to understand and comprehend the depth of that essence
of sanctity’s knowledge and perspicacity over all things in creation
depends on one’s faith and certitude, which is a matter that is clear and
evident before the people of Bahá; otherwise [one would remain] halted
and befuddled in the valley of wonderment and bewilderment.

[Impact of Deeds]
One day, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was at the pilgrim house adjacent to the blessed
Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. Several Bahá’í youth arrived and attained His
blessed presence. His spoke various exhortations and counsels, including
the essence of the following:

> Your fathers’ spirits in the next world are observant of your
> deeds. They become joyful and pleased with your goodly
> actions and behaviors, and sad and unhappy when it is
> otherwise.59

[Germany and Sangsar]
One night we were in His blessed presence in the blessed House of
Haifa. He spoke regarding the Bahá’ís of Germany. He stated, “Germany
means, Ál-mán.60 In constancy and firmness, they are like the Bahá’ís of
Iran.”

Regarding the believers of Sangsar, He remarked, “The Bahá’ís of
Sangsar are firm, constant, courageous and brave. They are Sang-Sar.”61

[The Guardianship]

59 Two lines are crossed and are completely unreadable at the top of page 97. It is
not clear if this was done by the author or by a later hand.
60 Ál-mán means our kin; this is a play on the word German in Persian. For a similar

recollection by Mu’ayyad, see, Eight Years Near ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: The Diary of Dr. Habíb
Mu’ayyad, (Trans. Ahang Rabbani).
61 A humorous play on words is intended. Sang is stone, and sar is head, and together

it means headstrong.

At times, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would speak in allusions about the Guardianship
of the Guardian of the Cause of God. Nevertheless, in those days [His
meaning] was beyond the power of comprehension and understanding
of the listeners, since such was necessary. However, after His blessed
passing, the meaning became evident and clear unto all.

One night we were all present in the blessed House of ‘Akká in the
presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The Guardian of the Cause of God was
present as well. [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] stated,

> After Me, the master of the Cause62, will firmly grasp the
> affairs [of the Faith]. Presently he is here as well.

No matter how deeply we thought about it, we could not
understand and discover His meaning since we could not see anyone
worthy of such a station. Therefore, we abandoned those thoughts in
consideration of the fact that we never imagined that the blessed
purpose of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was Shoghi Effendi Rabbani, who was in the
gathering with us.

From what I have heard, several individuals, like Hájí Mírzá
Haydar-‘Alí, had instinctively inhaled this musk-laden fragrance [i.e.
Shoghi Effendi’s future appointment], but were concealing it.

One day, the father of the Guardian of the Cause of God, the
honored Mírzá Hádí Afnán, was addressing him as Shoghi. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
stated, “Alas, I address him as Shoghi Effendi, and you call him Shoghi!”

One day this servant was in the company of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá from
the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh to ‘Akká. His steed was an excellent donkey.
When we arrived at ‘Akká, a carriage-driver had just arrived from Haifa,
bearing a missive from <p.100> the Guardian of the Cause of God,
which he had to present of His blessed Person [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. From
afar, as soon as his eyes fell upon His blessed Temple, he came running,
and when he reached His steed said, “This is a letter from Shoghi.”63
‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “Shoghi Effendi, Shoghi Effendi.” The man
repeated, “Shoghi Effendi.”

62   Lit. sáhib amr.
63   This sentence is in Arabic.

One day this servant, along with the late Áqá ‘Abdu’s-Samad, who
was an older brother of Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl Mansúr on his mother’s side,
attained the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the blessed House of Haifa. He
stated, “A letter has arrived for Me that is thoroughly confidential. Read
and return it forthwith.” He then dismissed us.

With utmost care, we read the letter in a secluded spot. We noted
that it was signed by the Guardian of the Cause of God, who in those
days was in a foreign land [England]. The entire content of that
supplication was about the exaltation of the Cause of God, the diffusion
of divine fragrances, formation of Assemblies, and the unity and
spirituality of friends of God in that region. There was nothing in the
letter that could be considered confidential. We then returned the
missive to His blessed presence.

However, after His ascension, it became clear and evident that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s purpose by the phrase “thoroughly confidential” was the
sanctified person of the Guardian of the Cause of God.

In short, each person, through certain hints and allusions, was
admonished and prepared [for Shoghi Effendi’s appointment].

[Jamáliyyih Khánum]
This servant had a paternal aunt by the name of Núríján, who was a
daughter of Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl Shahíd [martyred]. This aunt had a
daughter named, Jamáliyyih, who was a granddaughter of Áqá ‘Abdu’r-
Rasúl Shahíd. The Blessed Perfection had willed that Jamáliyyih Khánum
be in His service and she stood in attendance on that Promised Beauty.64

64 In interest of scholarly precision, it should be noted that the phrase here (p. 102,
line 4) is, bi khidmat ikhtiyár farmúdand. However, the words, bi khidmat appears to be
a later addition, and without it, the original may be understood to say, “had acquired
her as a wife.” When the original manuscript is made available to scholars, it should
be checked to see if bi khidmat was the author’s editing or by another hand. It should
be noted that the present translator knows of no evidence suggesting that
Bahá’u’lláh had married anyone other than Ásiyih Khánum, Mahd ‘Ulyá, and
Gawhar Khánum. This point is emphasized since certain opponents of the Faith
(e.g. ‘Abdu’l-Husayn Áyatí, known as Ávarih, and William Miller) have alleged that
Bahá’u’lláh had married this lady or have advanced other unfounded allegations.

The aforementioned Áqá ‘Abdu’s-Samad was a paternal cousin of this
servant and a brother of Jamáliyyih Khánum. Their father was a certain
Áqá ‘Alí and a native of Kashan.

A Tablet in honor of Jamáliyyih Khánum that positively describes
the situation was issued and revealed by the Supreme Pen. That Tablet is
thus:

He is the All-Knowing, the Wise.

> O Jamáliyyih, upon thee rest My Glory of God, My
bounties, and My favors.

I bear witness that thou didst attain My presence, and
> wast privileged to serve Me in the daytime and in the night
> season, in such wise that never wast thou overtaken by
> torpor in My service, nor prevented by any obstacle from
serving Me, nor from standing before My Countenance.

Rejoice thou at the testimony of My Most Exalted
> Pen, and say: “Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I ask
> Thee by Thy Most Great Name. Glorified art Thou, O Lord
> my God! I ask Thee by Thy Name whereby Thou hast
> subdued the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and made
> manifest the secrets of the realm of glory, to assist me to
> remain steadfast in Thy love, in Thy commemoration, and in
> Thy Cause. Thou, verily, art the All-Bountiful, the Most
Merciful.”

The Glory of Our presence rest upon thee, O My
> maidservant and My leaf,65 thou who circlest around Me at
> eventide and at dawn; and upon every maidservant who
> attaineth unto this Wondrous Cause, and who reverenceth
> thy station for the sake of God, the Almighty, the All-
> Praised.

The present translator knows no historical evidence in support of any of these
claims.
65 The term leaf is often reserved for Bahá’u’lláh’s female relatives (such as, His

wives or female descendants).

After the Blessed Beauty’s Ascension, Jamáliyyih Khánum had
said, “O God, grant me an ailment that I would have no sleep at night or
during the day.” The same thing occurred, and in that condition, she
passed away.66

After her passing, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “Jamáliyyih showed fidelity
to the Blessed Beauty.” Her resting place is in the Bahá’í cemetery in
‘Akká.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Residence]
Before ‘Abdu’l-Bahá journeyed to foreign countries, His principle
residence was in ‘Akká. However, in view of <p.105> the fact that the
blessed House [of ‘Abbúd] could not accommodate such a multitude,
nor provide for the comings and goings that were constantly taking place
before His blessed presence – such as visiting pilgrims, resident
believers, friends, strangers, authorities of the Ottoman government, the
‘ulamá, religious leaders, many who associated with or were related to
Him, servants and others – a large residence that was known as the
House of ‘Abdu’lláh Pashá became His residence, and offered comfort
and ease to all.

This house had an expansive courtyard, and every Friday all the
poor and destitute of ‘Akká, who constituted a large population, would
gather, and with His own hand and with utmost kindness and
compassion ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would bestow upon each one a sum of money.
This was the method and consistent way of His blessed person.

Through the efforts and intense spirituality of Ismá‘íl Áqá, the
faithful gardener of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, a garden and orchard was grown in
the courtyard of the house [of ‘Abdu’lláh Pashá]. It was most
enchanting, and would fill visitors with great delight.

On the side of the outer yard of the house was a spacious shelter
where the carriage of His blessed Person, with its horses and other
supplies, was kept. In those days, cars could not be found. The best

66 Most of this sentence is lightly crossed in the manuscript available to the present
translator and other words are written over it, which for the most part are
unreadable, but seem to indicate that Jamáliyyih Khánum suffered a period of illness
and depression before passing.

means for travel to the surrounding areas, or attending to various chores,
was by carriage, and even that was rare. Because of this, whenever the
nobles, religious leaders, officials of the Ottoman government, or
friends, wanted to go somewhere in that vicinity, they would ask ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá to allow them to use the carriage and the carriage-driver, Isfandiyár,
for the duration of their need.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá would sustain every form of hardship for the
protection and exaltation of the Cause of God, and to extinguish the fire
of sedition, enmity, jealousy and vengeance of the enemies at that time,
which was the height of violation of the Covenant, and to administer the
affairs of the people, whether friends or strangers.

[Husayn Áqá Tabrízí]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá even appointed a special coffee-brewer among the friends
whose name was Husayn Áqá Tabrízí. Whenever the ‘ulamá, clerics or
officials would attain His presence, in accordance with His blessed
instructions, he [Husayn Áqá] would prepare coffee, tea and a water-pipe
for the guests. He was very hard working even though he was an old
man. However, due to the intensity of his faith and certitude, he stood in
devoted service with his entire heart and soul. At the end, he passed
away in Haifa, and was submerged in God’s exalted mercy.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Speech]
When Turkish government officials from Istanbul would arrive and
attain the blessed presence [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], from the ease and
sweetness that He spoke Turkish they would be astonished,
wonderstruck and enchanted of that divine visage [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá].

When men of letters, the learned and scholars, either Arab or
otherwise, would arrive in His sanctified presence and that omnipotent
Master would commence speaking, they would be attracted beyond any
description or depiction to His mesmerizing utterances, and His
eloquence and fluency. Upon entering His blessed presence, they would
consider themselves deeply learned, and when leaving [would have come
to recognize themselves as] profoundly ignorant. The greatest scholars

would bow before Him and kiss His blessed hands, and in such instances
that essence of sanctity would always say, “Astaghfuru’lláh,
Astaghfuru’lláh!”67

[Nightly Gatherings]
In those days, every night a gathering would assemble, and in accordance
with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s instruction, a Qur’an reciter by the name of Shaykh
Yúnis, who was blind, would chant verses of Qur’an with hijází
intonation, and he would become the recipient of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
kindness. When a sufficient amount was recited, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say,
“Well done,” implying by this phrase that everyone’s spirit was
sufficiently elated. Afterwards, by His command, prayers would be
chanted. A non-Bahá’í who heard those prayers and Tablets once
exclaimed, “By God! These are Words of God!”

[Pilgrims]
In those days, rank upon rank of pilgrims <p.110> would arrive from
Iran and other places. The pilgrims who came from Iran were mostly
attired in the same manner and clothing that was current at the time of
the Qajar dynasty.

How often those pilgrims, out of sheer attraction, and
overwhelmed by faith, certitude, and love for the countenance of that
intended Beauty [‘Abdu’l-Bahá], would walk the entire long journey.
Upon attaining the threshold of that unquestioning Limit, out of fervor
and excitement that had filled their being, they would uncontrollably
throw themselves at His blessed feet and cry profusely, ennobling and
perfuming their faces by the dust of His magnificent feet.

Even though, out of the mercy and bounty of that compassionate
Master, the days of their attainments would be extended, nevertheless at
the time of departure the voice of their wailing and crying would be
raised heavenwards. That beloved of the world would try to calm those
souls until their sadness and grief was reduced, and at times they would

67   Literally “I ask God’s forgiveness,” or “God forbid!”

be honored with a Tablet revealed by the pen of the Center of the
Covenant and Testament.

‘Akká’s pilgrim house was in Khán Avamíd. Most days, pilgrims’
lunch and dinner was ábgúsht.68 One day ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came by the
pilgrim house and inquired of my uncle, Áqá Muhammad-Hasan, who
was the custodian of the pilgrim house, “Áqá Muhammad-Hasan, what
do you have for lunch?” He responded, “Ábgúsht.” He [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
stated, “Ábgúsht is a healthy meal. Therefore, I will be your guest
today.” It must be evident what joy and elation overcame the pilgrims
from learning that that day they would have lunch in the presence of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. “This did not [take place] save by His Bounties, the
Generous.”

In those days, a cloth was spread on ground for serving meals.

Either salad or yogurt accompanied lunch and dinner. In addition, sugary
halvah made with ground sesame seeds was at hand as well.

At all events, an unbounded and indescribable spirituality
enveloped everything. Night and day, all were engaged in speaking the
Truth. For sleeping, no special or designated spot was available, pilgrims
would assign each other’s place of rest, and with utmost spirit, fraternity,
joy and enchantment would all sleep in the same area. Some would sleep
in bags, and close them from inside, so they would be immune from the
bites of mosquitoes and fleas. Everyone rose early in the morning.

There was a parrot in the pilgrim house that every morning when
the pilgrims would come out of the room would greet them by “Alláh-u-
Abhá!”

There was also a parrot in the blessed House, that is, the House of
‘Abdu’lláh Pashá. One morning, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was pacing in the
courtyard and the parrot said, “Áqá!” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] responded, “Yes?”
The parrot said, “Say, ‘Yá Bahá’!69” Later, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to the
Greatest Holy Leaf, “Khánum, we were about to give away this parrot,
but he bought himself.”

In those days, Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí was in the pilgrim house,
and when anyone had a question about the Cause, would ask him.

68  Ábgúsht is an Iranian dish consisting of clear broth with meat and other
ingredients such as potatoes, beans and dried lemon.
69 Lit, By Bahá!

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Dream]
Before ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s journey to foreign lands, one day Hájí Mírzá
Haydar-‘Alí was in the blessed presence. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to him, “Last
night, I had a dream,” and proceeded to describe the dream, in which
there were birds and fish. He then asked, “What is its meaning?” He
[Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí] stated, “Its interpretation resides with Your
blessed Self.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “Whoever dreams of bird or fish
will not die until he reaches sovereignty. Therefore, We will not die until
We reach sovereignty.” This was an allusion to the exaltation and
diffusion of the Cause of God.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Residence in ‘Akká]
In short, in the days nearing His blessed return <p.115> from foreign
countries, gradually, the house of ‘Abdu’lláh Pashá was emptied and all
movable furnishing was transferred to the blessed house in Haifa.

After His return, His residence then became the blessed house in
Haifa. Even though this house was available previously, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
primary residence was ‘Akká.

[Haifa’s Pilgrim House]
Previously a pilgrim house had been constructed near the Shrine of the
Báb. Áqá Mírzá Ja‘far [Hadioff] Shírází Rahmání70, who in those days
lived in ‘Ishqabad, had built this pilgrim house, but gradually, since he
did not have sufficient funds. When his money was depleted, he would
return to ‘Ishqabad and resume his trading business; when some savings
had been accumulated, he would return to Haifa [and continue
construction]. It went thus until the pilgrim house was completed.

70 Rahmání is written above the line and appears to be a later addition. Mírzá Ja‘far
Hadioff was originally from Shiraz, had migrated to ‘Ishqabad to take advantage of
freedom of movement and commence for Bahá’ís, and there was engaged in trading
tea. The surname Rahmání was bestowed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

In accordance with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s blessed instruction, an
inscription was installed above the pilgrim house that read, “This is a
spiritual pilgrim house and has been raised by Áqá Mírzá Ja‘far Shírází
Rahmání.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say words to this effect, “If Áqá Mírzá Ja‘far
had not built this pilgrim house, his capital would have been wasted in
‘Ishqabad. Now no matter how much this pilgrim house is expanded, it
will remain in his name.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá by the Shrine of the Báb

[Payment of Huqúqu’lláh]
There was a certain Mírzá Abú’l-Hasan in Egypt that became owner of a
parcel of land. Oil was found in that land, and for this reason, he became
exceedingly wealthy and affluent. He asked ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “Excuse me
from payment of Huqúqu’lláh, because if I was to pay the Huqúq, I

would need to appoint a special clerk.” It was not long before his entire
wealth disappeared, and then he died.

In his entire life, he had only contributed a candelabrum to the
Shrine of the Exalted One [the Báb], and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had stated, “This
is what has been left for him.”

[Visit to ‘Akká]
At all events, after that [post-1914], whenever ‘Abdu’l-Bahá visited
‘Akká, the days of His stay would be either at the blessed house [of
‘Abbúd] or in the pilgrim house next to the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. After
the intervention71 of the British government, that previous situation, as
described earlier, did not continue.

At the time of the arrival of that government’s army and military
to Haifa and ‘Akká, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “The ship of the Cause has
reached the shore of safety.” His purpose was that the plundering hand
of the enemies of the Cause and the hate-filled Covenant-breakers was
now arrested from committing any damage or harm, and no protection,
assistance or supporter remained for them.

In ‘Akká a Christian attained His blessed presence and said, “I met
you in America.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “All people have questions
for us, except inhabitants of ‘Akká. We have left ‘Akká to its
inhabitants.”72 This comment was made to this person in consideration
of the fact that he had seen both the excitement and exhilaration of the
people of that region [America, by meeting ‘Abdul-Bahá], and the
coldness and indifference of the people of ‘Akká [towards the Faith].

[Visiting the Mosque]
Like before [His trip to the west], ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would visit the mosque
on Fridays, and after offering His obligatory prayers, would give alms to
the poor.

71 The original word, ihtilál, meaning reduction, has been marked in the margin to be
replaced with mudákhilih, meaning intervention. The later editing appeared more
accurate and was adopted for the present translation.
72 The narrator provides this statement in both Arabic and its translation in Persian.

There was only one mosque in Haifa, named Jámi‘ al-Súq – that is,
the bazaar mosque. However, later another mosque was built near the
train station. Some residents used to say, “His Holiness ‘Abbás Effendi
had said that one <p.120> mosque is insufficient for Haifa, and He
contributed substantially towards construction of this other mosque.”

[The Future of Haifa and ‘Akká]
At all events, every movement and deed of His blessed person was solely
for the sake of the protection and safety of the Cause of God, and the
security and sheltering of [Bahá’í] sacred places from the harm of the
enemies and ill-wishers.

Haifa in 1910s

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say to this effect, “There is a water
wellspring in the land surrounding the Shrine of the Exalted One [the
Báb], but it is untimely to disclose it, and it must remain hidden until its
time.” From this blessed utterance, it was evident that once that

wellspring came to the surface, what immense beauty and splendor
would encircle the Shrine of the Exalted One.73

He used to state, “Mount Carmel will be all enveloped in light.”
He would add to this effect:

> At dawn, with wondrous and melodious voices, they will be
engaged in the mention of God.

Ships carrying the flag of “Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá!” will
> anchor at the port [of Haifa] and kings will disembark. On
> foot and bareheaded, and with humility and modesty, and in
> a state of supplication and entreaty, chanting divine verses
> and prayers, they will attain to a visit of the Shrine of the
> Exalted One [the Báb]. On the path to the Shrine of the
> Exalted One, there will be pools of water, gardens and
places for rest and respite.

Afterwards, with bouquets of flowers over their
> shoulders, and while reciting divine verses and prayers, they
will visit the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh.

At that time, after the bay is drained, a straight avenue
> will be constructed connecting the Shrine of the Exalted
One [the Báb] to the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh.

However, we will see all of this from the Malakút [the
Kingdom of God].

One day at the Shrine of the Exalted One, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke on
this theme, and also said, “I see these things now, but you do not see.
My presence is a hindrance. Later, the Cause will grow.” From this
73According to Fariborz Sahba (private communications, 5 March 2008), one of the
challenges faced by the project team building the Terraces around the Shrine of the
Báb was the irrigation of gardens, especially under the tight water regulations in
Haifa. It so happened that the above statement of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was brought to
Sahba’s attention and with the help of local water consultants and geologists, the
source of water was located in 2000. This underground water reservoir appears to
have been created because of an earthquake fault that crosses the terrain of Mount
Carmel. The project team then managed to negotiate and convince the authorities to
make an exception and allow that water to be used solely for the gardens around the
Shrine, thus fulfilling ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s prediction.

blessed utterance, it was evident that people are more inclined to the
unseen than the seen. It is because they consider the Temple of the
Cause as one like themselves.

[Tiberius]
At times, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would journey to Tiberius. [One time,] the Qádí
[judge] of Haifa sent a missive to His blessed presence inquiring of the
condition of Tiberius. In the course of responding to this supplication,
He stated, “If you ask about Tiberius, know that its stones are black, its
inhabitants are Jewish and their appearance is basic.”74 It is likely that he
[the Qádí] had wanted ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to invite him there, so he had been
honored with this response.

One day in Tiberius, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was pacing by the shores of the
Dead Sea.75 Khusraw was also in His blessed presence. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
stated, “It was here that Peter fished.” While He was speaking these
words, suddenly a large fish threw himself from the sea and landed
before His blessed feet. He said, “Come Khusraw, take it, as our daily
sustenance has arrived.”

[Confirmations]
In the days of the Blessed Perfection, exalted and magnified be His
mention, a native of ‘Akká had invited a group to lunch beneath the
spruce-fir trees situated across from the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, which was
a most pleasant spot. However, at lunchtime, additional people arrived
who had not been invited. The host was deeply perturbed how to feed
anyone with the [limited] food that he had prepared. Of necessity, he had
gone into the Mansion [of Bahjí] and attained the presence of the
Blessed Beauty, inquiring about a remedy for his problem. That Author
of bounties and blessings had said, “The Master should go and with His

74 The narrator gives this statement in both original Arabic and translation in
Persian. Translation of the final phrase is not precise.
75 Most likely, Bahr Miyat [Dead Sea] was a slip of pen and the Sea of Galilee was

meant.

own hand serve the food.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá …76 had served the food,
<p.125> and not only was it sufficient unto everyone, but an excess
amount was left.

The late Áqá Jamál was a cook in the blessed house, and was
known as Abú-Sabrí. For a while, he helped my paternal uncle, Áqá
Muhammad-Hasan Khádim, in the pilgrim house of the Shrine of the
exalted One and was of service in that place. He related:

> One day, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was in the pilgrim house [of Haifa].
> Food was prepared for several of pilgrims and guests.
> However, at lunchtime, an [unexpected] group of pilgrims
> arrived. Since the prepared food was insufficient, a lesser
> quantity was placed in each dish and plate. Suddenly,
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came into the kitchen and said, “Jamál, what
are you doing? Fill the plates.”

I did as bidden, filled the plates, and served them to
> everyone. I observed that the food was most sufficient for
all.

Later, He summoned me and said to the effect, “It
> had passed noon and everyone was hungry. When food is
> served in small portions, even if a second helping is offered,
> it will not satisfy. But when it is given in sufficient quantity,
> then the eye is satisfied.” His blessed intent was that first the
> eye must be satisfied for the stomach to feel the same way.

[On Caution]
One night there was a gathering at the blessed house of ‘Akká and in
midst of it, the gardener of the Bágh [Garden] Firdaws arrived. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá inquired, “Who is at the Bágh?” He said, “No one is there.”
‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “Incidents happen suddenly. Caution should
never be abandoned.”

[Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl]
76   Half a line at the bottom of page 124 was not copied in the present manuscript.

One day, along with my paternal uncle, Áqá Muhammad-Hasan, we
attained the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá outside the outer gate of the
blessed House in Haifa. In the course of his utterances, He stated, “If
five persons like Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl could be found, I would prostrate
Myself on the ground.”

When the Kitáb Fará’id was printed and brought before His blessed
presence, He kissed the book.

After he had been submerged in God’s mercy [i.e. passed away],
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “He was an amazing man. He was aware of all
things.”

During the height of revolt of the Covenant-breakers, Mírzá
Abú’l-Fadl would go the Mansion of Bahjí and meet with the pivot of
rebellion, perchance he could make him repent [his opposition]. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá inquired, “Why do you go visit Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí (the arch-
Covenant-breaker)?” He responded, “Your Excellency, was His Holiness
the Exalted One [the Báb] the true One or was He not?” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
said, “He was the true One.” Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl then said, “If You say
that He was not, I will accept.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá then remained silent.
Through this exchange, Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl established the depth of his
faith, certitude, constancy and firmness in the divine Covenant and
Testament.

One time, during the days and pilgrimage of Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl77,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to him to the effect, “If I were in your place, I would
go to Egypt and engage in teaching and educating students in the
Qur’an.” From this comment, Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl grew reflective. [Seeing
his silence and condition, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] stated, “It is not too late. You
can do so now.” It was because of this that in accordance with the
blessed instruction, he transferred his residence to Egypt and succeeded
in immensely mighty services.

In truth, he was a proof unto the Cause. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say,
“Even the very water that Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl drank was to give him the
strength to write [in support of the Faith]”.

One night an assemblage was meeting in the blessed house of
Haifa and the Guardian of the Cause of God said to the effect, “If Mírzá
Abú’l-Fadl were here, he would adduce from the [Sacred] books.” From
77   This phrase appears to be a later addition to the manuscript.

this blessed utterance it was understood that in much the same way as
the previous events [of the Cause] had been in accordance with firm
texts and prophecies of heavenly books [of the past], the present
occurrences related to the Guardianship were likewise mentioned and
ascribed in the celestial books, requiring interpretation by those endowed
with knowledge and the learned in Bahá, since nothing in the divine
unfoldment is by accident.

[Good Citizenship]
My father used to relate that the Blessed Beauty had said, “When you
assume residence in a house, do not worsen nor improve it.” From this
utterance of the Truth it was evident that destruction and change were
beneath the station of man, nor were they acceptable unto God or
mankind.

Indeed, Bahá’u’lláh had also advised, “When you leave a dwelling,
it must be cleaned before returning it to its owner. However, it must be
no worse and no better than the original. Otherwise, the owner will
become greedy and this will cause difficulties.”

It so happened that <p.130> this servant rented a dwelling that
consisted of one room. However, to improve its condition, after
receiving permission [from the owner] I installed some shelves. Even
though the owner was a Bahá’í, he increased the rent. At the end, I was
forced to return it to him in the original state. Even though it brought
him no benefit, this caused me difficulty and loss.

[Siyyid Mihdí Dahají]
There was a certain Siyyid Mihdí from Dahaj. At the beginning of the
Cause, he was among the renowned teachers of the Faith. However, due
to his unjustified expectations, in his latter days he joined hands with the
Covenant-breakers and used to write letters to various people in hope
that, like the foolish ones of this day,78 he would derail souls from the
straight path of God. The friends of God would send responses to his
letters first to blessed presence [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], and then these would
78   Most likely a reference to Jamshíd Ma‘ání, mentioned later in this narrative.

reach him. Beneath one of the responses to him, the following poem was
penned [by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]:

The bounty of God will tolerate for some time,

But when the limit is surpassed, it will defame.

At last, with great regret and remorse, he sank to the lowest abyss
of hell.79

This egotistical man had two dimwitted and unintelligent sons:
Husayn and Hasan. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to relate to this effect, “When
speaking with Me, Siyyid Mihdí would greatly extol and praise Hasan’s
astuteness, saying that the lad was most intelligent. There was a herd of
goats at Bahjí. [While playing,] each of the Bahá’í kids was holding the
udder of one of the goats, imbibing their milk. However, he [Hasan] was
holding a male goat, imbibing it, and saying, ‘This is salty.’” When telling
this story He would laugh heartily.80

Siyyid Mihdí had amassed a substantial sum. A Jewish man enticed
him and for this reason, he had given him his entire capital, which he
embezzled, and decided that escaping was the preferred route.

Sanctified is God! Whoever rose to oppose or harm the Center of
God’s Covenant and Testament was seized in the grasp of all manners of
divine chastisement.
79 Siyyid Mihdí was a learned man and a capable promoter of the Faith. Bahá’u’lláh
had conferred the title of Ismu’lláhu’l-Mihdí (the Name of God Mihdí) on him and
had revealed a number of Tablets in his honor. He was a native of Dahaj in the
province of Yazd, visited Bahá’u’lláh in Baghdad, Edirne, and ‘Akká, and had
received much attention. Siyyid Mihdí traveled widely throughout Iran and was
greatly loved by the Bahá’ís. From a description left by Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí, it
appears that Siyyid Mihdí considered himself above other believers, an image that he
tried to promote through various means.
80 According to Fádil Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 8, part 2, pp. 900-901,

the reason that Siyyid Mihdí Dahají was extolling his sons to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was that
he wanted Husayn to marry Munavvar Khánum, one of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s daughters. It
was when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refused this and married them to people whom Siyyid
Mihdí considered his inferiors that Siyyid Mihdí went over to Mírzá Muhammad-
‘Alí’s side in about 1909 and was declared a Covenant-Breaker. From this account,
one can see that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had good reason to refuse the marriage. (Based on
Moojan Momen’s posting on Tarikh discussion group, 4 March 2008).

‘Abdu’l-Bahá would also tell that he [Siyyid Mihdí] had written píáz
with a dhál.81 He would tell this story with a resonant accent and smile.

> His sons [Husayn and Hasan] died in misery and deprivation.

At one time, some of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s verses and blessed Tablets in
Arabic had reached one of the Covenant-breakers. Since he wanted to
imply that he had knowledge and learning, he had said, “Its
vowelizations are correct.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would tell this story and smile.

In truth, when a person turns away from God, even his mental
faculties and senses are impaired.82

[The Narrator’s Family]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, “A good wife is like paradise unto a man and a
bad one is like hell.”

It was two years after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ascension that this servant
married. From this union, we had eleven children: seven boys and four
girls. Their names, in order, were: Jamílih, Jamíl, Nadím, Labíb, Nabíhih,
Na‘ím, Ruhiyyih, Amín, Bashír, Samír, and Fá’izih. The names of these
children have been given in their chronological order. Out of her grace
and bounty, the Greatest Holy Leaf, the Liege Lady of the people of
Bahá, granted the names of these children through the fifth child, that is,
Nabíhih, <p.135> thereby bestowing this honor upon them.

However, Jamílih and Jamíl were names bestowed by the Blessed
Beauty on a sister and a brother of this servant. Since both had passed
away, the Liege Lady of the people of Bahá willed that these two names,
which had streamed from the lips of the Merciful [Bahá’u’lláh], be once
again returned to this family. Therefore, from two directions these
names are a source of honor unto them. That is, in addition to the
sovereign will of the Greatest Holy Leaf – may my life be a sacrifice unto
her kindness and her bounties – the tongue of the Beauty and of the

81Píáz means onion and is written with ze.
82Most of page 133 was left blank or was erased in the copy of the manuscript
available to the translator.

Grandeur [Bahá’u’lláh] also uttered these two names. God willing, may
they be jamílih and jamíl in every way.83

Similarly, may their brothers and sisters also be known by the
beauteous attributes given to them as names, and may they remain
successful and confirmed under the shadow of God’s Universal House
of Justice, which is the authority and refuge of the people of Bahá.
Today, this is indeed the path of righteousness, and eternal glory, and all
else is evident loss.

My wife’s name is Zaynab. She is the daughter of Sa‘íd Ghaffír;
and her mother’s name was also Zaynab. They were of the believers of
Damascus, Syria. In those days, she was studying at the College of
Beirut. Since her parents had passed away, her maternal uncle, Áqá
‘Abdu’r-Razzaq Rúmání, had raised her.

At that time, this servant journeyed from ‘Akká to Beirut [and met
Zaynab] and since it was the divine decree [for us to eventually marry],
the consent of the two of us and parents were conditioned upon the
approval and good-pleasure of the Liege Lady of the people of Bahá,
who at that time was residing in Haifa. After inquiring, an affirmative
response and complete consent was bestowed [by Bahiyyih Khánum].

Therefore, from Beirut we proceeded directly to Haifa and arrived
at the blessed House [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. Upon arrival, we learned that
[Bahiyyih] Khánum had gone to ‘Akká. As such, this servant, without
halting in Haifa, proceeded forthwith to ‘Akká.

That very day, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s daughter and my bride-to-be arrived
in the blessed House of [‘Abbúd in] ‘Akká, which, as mentioned
previously, had been our abode and place of residence in accordance
with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s blessed instructions. It must be evident that in the
presence of the Greatest Holy Leaf what exceeding gladness enveloped
us!

In short, three days after our arrival, in accordance with traditions,
law and wisdom, first Qur’anic [i.e. Islamic] marriage vows were taken
and after that, in accordance with the command of the Liege Lady of the
people of Bahá to my paternal uncle, Áqá Muhammad-Hasan, the
Bayánic marriage took place.
83Jamílih and jamíl are feminine and masculine versions of the same attribute,
meaning beautiful, handsome, reputable, or good.

The morning of that day, [Bahiyyih] Khánum and the daughters of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá decided to return to Haifa. At the time of leaving the
House, she remarked to this servant, “Groom, may God watch over
you!” This evanescent one had no words save bowing, humility and
submission. In truth, it was a most undeserved bequest upon this
servant.

At all events, these children, that is, Jamílih, Jamíl, Nadím and
Labíb, were born in the blessed House [of ‘Abbúd] – a bounty that
hereafter will not visit upon anyone else, especially since it occurred in
the blessed days of the Greatest Holy Leaf. That is, never again until the
end of time will the eye of creation witness such a remnant and vestige
[of the Holy Tree, like Bahiyyih Khánum].

[Revising Traditions]
At the request of their parents, the newly born children of the friends of
God were named by ‘Abdul-Bahá, the Center of the Divine Covenant
and Testament. After the ascension of His blessed Person, the friends
would ask the Greatest Holy Leaf [to name their newborn]. However,
after the ascension of the Liege Lady of the people of Bahá, the
Guardian of the Cause of God stated, “Henceforth, parents should name
their own children.” His purpose was that the friends of God should not
bring this request to his blessed presence, since, firstly, it was a waste of
his precious time and, secondly, the will of his blessed person had
decreed in this regard not to follow the example [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá].84

For instance, whenever He wanted to express <p.140> His special
bounty and benevolence, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would always say, “Marhabá!”
The Guardian of the Cause of God completely withheld himself from
uttering that phrase.

When the friends, either privately or in a gathering, attained the
presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, He would say at the end, “Fí amánu’lláh!”85

84 The present translator recalls with fondness that this tradition was followed
during the tenure of ‘Ali Nakhjavani on the Universal House of Justice, when he
would often suggest names for newborns, including a name for the translator’s
younger son, Tebyan.
85 Lit, Be under God’s protection.

However, the beloved Guardian of the Cause of God would stand up
and leave the room.

He [Shoghi Effendi] was most attentive in his observance of such
[separate] stations. Therefore, he did not approve of such practices [as
naming newborns] that had been practiced in the past, so that his
servitude unto the Threshold86 would be made manifest in every way.

The beloved friends of God who in the days of the Blessed
perfection – exalted be His mighty mention – had attained to the Visage
of God [Bahá’u’lláh], and also had attained to the presence of the Center
of Divine Covenant and Testament, would say that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, from
the perspective of might, grandeur, splendor, conduct and exposition,
was identical to the Blessed Beauty; except in the presence of that
Promised Beauty, He was the very manifestation of servitude.

In consideration of the fact that this servant witnessed and
attained the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the Guardian of the Cause
of God, I also beheld the same might, grandeur and dignity of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá in the sacred being of the Guardian.

It is evident that since they all are representative of the Truth, then
they are one reality, and no difference is seen in their essence except
whatever difference that might exist due to their station and rank.

[Simple Expositions]
One night a gathering was held in the blessed House of Haifa. For an
occasion, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “The Persian language is not so easy.”

Whenever plain souls like this lowly one were present, that essence
of kindness and compassion would speak with simple and common
words, so that all would understand His remarks. On the other hand, if a
translator was involved, He [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] would be considerate of him
so that he would be able to carry out his charge.

[Proving the Truth of Islam]

86The author evokes Shoghi Effendi’s well-known signature on his correspondence
with the East, which read, Bandih ástánash, Shoghi [the servant of His Threshold,
Shoghi].

One day during the time of the Ottoman government, several Muslim
‘ulamá were in a gathering in Jámi‘ Jazzár [the mosque of al-Jazzár] with
the mutisarrif, who was the governor of the region. At that assemblage, a
Christian priest also arrived. Soon discussions with that priest turned to
religion and the proof of the truth of the Messenger of God
[Muhammad]. However, the ‘ulamá discovered themselves unable and
powerless at presenting sufficient proofs and establishing the truth [of
Prophet Muhammad] in response to arguments and questions posed by
the priest.

When the mutisarrif witnessed the situation to be as such, he
became deeply perturbed. He summoned his attendant and whispered to
him, “Go to the presence of His Holiness ‘Abbás Effendi and say that
the mutisarrif is requesting Him to come forthwith.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá consented and arrived at the gathering, and saw the
situation. In order that no one would suspect that he had instigated
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s attendance, after the customary greetings and expressions
of humility, the mutisarrif stated, “What an auspicious hour have we
attained the presence of Your Holiness, since a religious discussion is
taking place here.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “Very well. We will listen too.”

However, the actual discussion was in Arabic and what is written
here [in Persian] is a summary of the events.

Gradually, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá assumed the thread of conversation from
them [the ‘ulamá] and began to directly speak with the priest. Soon, His
blessed utterances were surging forth, to the point that he [the priest]
confessed and acknowledged the truth of the Messenger of God
[Muhammad].

However, he stated, “We [the Christians] are like inhabitants of a
village, who are used to dwelling in the village and unaccustomed and
unwilling to live in the city.” He likened the Religion of Christ to a
village and the Dispensation of Muhammad to a city.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “If in the days of Christ a Jew had said
such a thing in His presence, would He have accepted?”

The priest said, “No.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, <p.145> “I do not accept it from you
either.”87

After this penetrating response and the silence of the priest, all
present in that assembly were exceedingly happy.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Guidance]
During the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, whenever a person had a
problem or a difficulty and presented it to Him in hope of guidance,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá would state whatever was most effective and conducive for
[resolving] his situation. Moreover, when that person acted according [to
the given guidance], then he would arrive at a complete resolution.

At times, certain thoughts would occur to the person seeking
guidance, and he would imagine that those avenues might support better
results; when he presented those [alternative] ideas, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would
say, “Very well.” Afterwards though, [from the implementation of the
person’s own idea], opposite results [from those which were desired]
would be gained. And when this reached the ears of His blessed Person,
He would say, “His welfare was in the first suggestion.” That is, if the
individual had acted according to the guidance that He had first offered,
then he would have been successful.

How happy is a person who, faced with divine advice, is in a state
of utter resignation, and has no thoughts or will of his own!

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Humor]
Some men with a mustache like to twist their mustache. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
used to say, “Whoever twists his mustache is sullen.”88

For the enjoyment of those in His presence, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at times
would employ a little humor, which delighted His listeners.

There was a certain Khajih Nasíf in ‘Akká, who was Christian and
the owner of the pilgrim house next to the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh.

87 The narrator gives the last exchange in both original Arabic and its translation in
Persian.
88 It is likely that this statement was a reference to Western missionaries, who were

often dry in their demeanor.

Previously, he would come and go in the blessed House [of ‘Abbúd], and
had learned a few Persian words. He had married a Christian woman,
thoroughly devoid of beauty. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “I asked him,
‘What do you do with her?’ And he responded, ‘I turn off the light.’”
‘Abdu’l-Bahá would then smile.

There was a certain Shaykh ‘Alí in ‘Akká, who had become a
believer in his native town of Kashan. He was half-cleric, but a very
simple man. He worked as a barber. He also had two donkeys, which he
used to rent out for extra income.

On this pretext [of renting the animals], someone took away the
donkeys, with no intention of returning them. He mentioned the
situation to His blessed Person and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded [in humor],
“O Shaykh, donkeys are gone, donkeys are gone, donkeys are gone!”

> He [Shaykh ‘Alí] had a wife, who was from Kashan.

In those days, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s residence was in the House of
‘Abdu’lláh Pashá. When the [nightly] gathering was held, the Shaykh said,
“Last night I dreamt that I was riding my [lost] donkey.” And he
described some details.

There was a certain Áqá Faraj from Isfahan, who was most witty.

He was at the gathering also. Even though he was in excess of ninety
years of age, if someone said to him that he was old or decrepit, he
would become very agitated.

One day, for the sake of humor, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked him, “Áqá
Faraj, are you older or I?” He said, “Master, the whole world testifies to
your greatness – both inwardly and outwardly!”

When the Shaykh [‘Alí] was waiting to hear an interpretation of his
dream, Áqá Faraj said to him, “Even in the mosquito net you were riding
your donkey?” When he spoke this banter, particularly in the presence of
His blessed Person, such laughter overcame those in attendance that in
order to give everyone space for enjoyment, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá immediately
left the room.

In short, this was the only interpretation of his dream that he
heard.

[Bahá’u’lláh’s Influence]

One night there was a gathering in the blessed House of ‘Akká, and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá shared the essence of the following:

> There was a Kurdish person who was deeply devoted to the
Blessed Beauty, and used to attain His sacred presence.

One day, [Bahá’u’lláh] inquired of his health and
> wellbeing. He said, “I have a problem, but I am ashamed to
mention it.” He responded, “Do not be embarrassed; say it.”

It became evident that he was in love with the
> daughter of a certain Pashá, but [given his humble
> circumstances] marriage with her was impossible.
> Nevertheless, the Blessed Beauty arranged a solution [and
the marriage took place].

After a while, <p.150> a missive arrived from him,
> saying, “My wife has given birth to a child and I request a
> name for him.”89

In sharing this story, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was smiling. His purpose was
to illustrate the sovereignty and influence of the Blessed Beauty under all
circumstances.90

[Old Traditions]
One day, several prominent men of Islam were in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
presence in ‘Akká.91 One of them asked for water, but drank only a
mouthful from the water in the cup. Another of them said to him, “Do
you not know that there is a hadith92 that states water must be drunk in
three mouthfuls?”

89 The words of the Kurdish man are given in what appears to be a Kurdish dialect.
90 A similar story is attributed to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in: “Told by Abdu’l Bahá: From
Diary of Mirza Ahmad Sohrab”, July 3, 1914, Star of the West, Vol. 9, p. 212-214.
However, in this story it is Jesus who grants a similar wish to a poor man.
91 The phrase in ‘Akká seems to be a later addition.
92 Often translated as traditions, it is a vast collection of sayings of the Prophet

Muhammad and the Imams, often being of highly questionable provenance.

His blessed Person shared this story in our assembly and smilingly
added, “And he responded, ‘This is the first mouthful.’”

Many of the traditions and practices which were not worthy of
direct discussion, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would elucidate them through humor or
stories, and thereby edify and educate.

[On Marriage]
Regarding marriage and its prerequisites, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to speak the
following exact words, “Man must be godly and be able to earn a
livelihood for his family and himself.”

This brief utterance, issued and spoken by the lips of His
sovereign will, is most precious before those endowed with knowledge
and is filled with wisdom, since it is a principle point and everything else
is secondary. Therefore, the happiness sought in marriage by the
daughters of the faithful is under the shadow of this principle and
nothing else.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “The least of the friends is better than the
fairest of the nonbelievers.”

Moreover, He used to say, “The worst of the friends is better than
the best of the nonbelievers.”

These blessed utterances were solely for guidance, happiness and
ease of the people of Bahá. Blessed is the one who followed [Him] and
adhered [to the Faith].

[A Dream]
There was a person in the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá who lived in
‘Akká and used to attain His blessed presence. One day, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
was speaking of the influence of dreams and visions. This man said, “I
do not believe in dreams.” He responded, “Very well. Let’s wait till you
come to believe.”

After a while, this man had to journey to Haifa. While there, he
dreamt that a messenger had come from ‘Akká bearing a letter in his
name. When he opened the enveloped, he noticed that it was written,
“Your daughter has died, but she has not had her funeral procession.

Come quickly.” [In this dream,] he returned forthwith to ‘Akká and
when he arrived, he saw a coffin in the house’s courtyard containing his
daughter. A large multitude had gathered for the funeral, waiting for his
arrival. Afterwards, the funeral took place.

He woke up from this dream. That very morning, the same details
that he had dreamt – no more and no less – occurred. Afterwards, he
came into the blessed presence [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], and had said, “I have
come to believe in dreams; however, I did not expect that it would be in
such a way.” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] responded, “Such was the divine decree.”

[Payment of Debt]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá would speak considerably regarding payment of debts. For
instance, He would state in effect, “There was a person in debt who
owed money, but his income was insignificant. Nevertheless, he had set
aside a portion of his income for the payment of this debt and gradually
was reimbursing what he owed. After a while, he observed that his entire
debt was paid and his obligations were fulfilled.” This utterance of His
blessed Person was both praise and a lesson.

[Messengerhood]
One day this servant was in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Haifa.
Suddenly and without a previous reference, He said, “Messengerhood
means to convey a message.”

It appeared that the meaning of this word <p.155> was unclear to
some and His blessed will had decreed that it be made clear and evident.

[Ladies Attire]
One day a Turkish woman from Istanbul arrived at the blessed House of
Haifa. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá greatly praised her attire and the manner of her
clothing. This was because at that time, the Muslim women who dwelled
in the cities would go outside the house wearing a chador and a face
covering. However, that woman from Istanbul had only covered her hair
under a scarf, and her dress covered her up to the neck, and had long

sleeves and was ankle-length. Therefore, with great joy, [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
said, “This is the meaning of ‘modesty.’93”

[On Marriage]
One time, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá observed that a husband and wife among the
pilgrims had utmost affection for one another during their entire stay,
and consulted with each other on every subject. In seeing this, He stated,
“This is an example of being a husband and wife.”

There was a certain Hájí ‘Alí from Yazd who was among the early
believers in the Cause. He was ninety years old. He would relate that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá had said about marriage, “This connection was decreed
prior to creation.” From this utterance, it was understood that marriage
and union is dependent on God’s will and divine dictate.94

[Children’s Spiritual Education]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to rise early morning before sunrise and wake up the
household. Sometimes He would go to the rooftop and engage in prayer
and meditation. Afterwards, He would proceed to the room of His
illustrious sister, the Greatest Holy Leaf, which was the gathering place
[of the family] and the morning tea. Then the family of God and His
household would all come together, and the children, at ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
bidding, would recite prayers. Tea would be served. He used to say, “Do
not give tea to children, and if you do, make it light.”

He asked one of His grandchildren, “Where is your heart?”95 The
latter placed his hand on his stomach and said, “Here.” He stated, “That

93 The word hijáb is typically rendered as veil, but in this context, it is understood by
the translator to mean modesty.
94 On a number of occasions, Abú’l-Qásim Afnán related to the present translator

that the Hand of the Cause of God Tarázu’lláh Samandarí had shared with him that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá had said to him directly that three things are out of man’s control and
were decreed before time by God, as they have to do with the world above:
marriage, pilgrimage and death.
95 While the original dil is always translated as heart, in Persian parlance it means

stomach.

is your abdomen.” His purpose was merely to correct this common
mistake made by some souls.

In a gathering that was held in a small room with many in
attendance, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “The youngsters should give their seats
to adults.”

In short, all His blessed utterances, whether personal or
communal, were based on wisdom, intended to guide, edify and educate,
bringing about righteousness in each soul.

[Spiritual Assemblies]
One day a group of the friends of God were gathered in the pilgrim
house of the Shrine of the Exalted One for the purpose of visiting [the
Shrine of the Báb], and they were in the presence of the Guardian of the
Cause of God. He was speaking about obedience to the instructions of
the Spiritual Assemblies, and his point was that the community members
should obey the Assembly members. He stated, “The Spiritual Assembly
will make mistake and their retribution is with God. However, the House
of Justice will not err.” It is evident that the intent of his blessed person
was the Universal House of Justice, which is immune from making any
error.

[Christians]
It was submitted to the blessed presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “What reason
has caused there to be more Christians than Muslims, even though His
Holiness the Messenger of God [Muhammad] declared Himself after His
Holiness Jesus?” He responded, “The reason is that their hand was not
stained by the blood of Prophets.”

[Mírzá Abú’l-Hasan Afnán]
An eminent personage of the Afnán of the Divine Lote-Tree [the family
of the Báb], whose name was Mírzá Abú’l-Hasan, was a resident of
Haifa. He was deeply pious, humble and unassuming, and the object of
attention and bounties of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He had a wife who was also an

Afnán. One day when she was attending to her duties in the kitchen,
suddenly the flames <p.160> engulfed her and caused her death. The
honored Mírzá Abú’l-Hasan was profoundly heartbroken and depressed
over this horrendous incident. Therefore, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had whispered to
him, “I, too, will leave soon.”

After hearing this utterance, he was bereft of patience. Next
morning, after attending to necessary tasks and the purchase of daily
provisions for his household – which had been one of his duties – he set
out at an early hour for the seashore. After discarding his clothing and
placing his green turban, which was his ancestral emblem, over them, he
threw himself into the surging sea.

When this news reached His blessed Person [‘Abdu’l-Bahá], He
instructed that certain sea-experienced souls immediately retrieve his
remains from the grasp of the strong waves. [When he was later
examined, it was discovered that] the fish had only eaten away one of his
eyes.

Thereupon, the funeral of his earthly remains was conducted with
utmost tribute and dignity in the blessed presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

After this incident, three days later, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s blessed
ascension occurred.96

At the time of the funeral procession for the sanctified Temple of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, that Beloved of all creation and that essence of
unquestioned holiness, some of the friends were shouting, “Happy art
thou, O Afnán!”

The aforementioned Áqá Jamál, who was the cook in the blessed
House, used to tell a story that one day the honored [Mírzá Abú’l-Hasan]
Afnán came to the House carrying a quantity of sugar-cube97, remarking,
“Today, the Master said, ‘I asked Áqá Habíb about his business affairs,
and even though I know he has money, he said he did not have anything,
and that saddened me. I asked Áqá Jamál the same, and even though I
know he does not have anything, he expressed his gratitude and
satisfaction. That made Me happy and pleased.’ Now in consideration
that you caused His blessed heart to be filled with joy, I wanted to

cone-shaped bulk of sugar.

sweeten your mouth.” With that, he gave me the sugar-cube as a gift.
May God’s mercy and paradise rest upon him!

[Hájí Muhammad Shúshtarí]
There was a certain Hájí Muhammad, who was a native of Shushtar. He
was known as Hájí Muhammad Shúshtarí. Previously he had lived in
Baghdad and many times had walked from that town to the Holy Land
to attain the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and visit the Holy Places. He had
also spent some time in Egypt and Beirut. At the end, in accordance with
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s instruction, he became a resident of the Holy Land, and
for a while was engaged in Haifa as a cobbler – by this means he used to
earn his livelihood.

One day a priest took his shoes to Hájí Muhammad for repair. He
started a conversation with the priest and gradually reached the desired
topic [of teaching him the Bahá’í Faith]. Eventually, he said to him, “You
must worship the donkey, not the cross. This is because Jesus suffered
bitterly on the cross, but His donkey brought Him much ease and
comfort.”

On hearing this, the priest became deeply perturbed and
distressed, and quickly sought the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, complaining
about what had been said to him.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to tell this incident and laugh. He stated, “I said
to the Hájí not to say these things again.”

One time ‘Abdu’l-Bahá related that Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí (the
arch-Covenant-breaker) was passing down a road and Hájí Muhammad
had come face to face with him, but turned his head and changed his
direction. His point was [to illustrate] his constancy and firmness in the
divine Covenant and Testament.

From near or far, whenever his gaze fell upon the blessed Temple
[of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], he would begin to whisper the prayer, “Praise be unto
Thee and thanks be rendered unto Thee.” [He conducted himself] in the
same manner when he attained the presence of the Guardian of the
Cause of God.

He had a most humble dwelling near the blessed House of Haifa.

One day at noon, a number of the friends were partaking of lunch at the

blessed House, and from the window, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá saw <p.165> him
going home. He said, “Hájí Muhammad is an old man. Be considerate of
him.” That is, he should receive a portion from this food and
sustenance.

Outwardly, Hájí Muhammad was frail, fallen and poor. However,
he possessed an extraordinarily pure heart, filled with spirit and joy.

One day in the pilgrim house of the Shrine of the Exalted One
[the Báb] – on the day devoted to visitation of the Shrine, with the
beloved friends of God in the presence of the Guardian of the Cause of
God – one of the friends had put one leg over the other. Hájí
Muhammad considered such an act outside of the bounds of
appropriateness. He rose from his seat and undid his crossed legs. After
so doing, he was rebuked and threatened by the honored Mírzá Hádí
Afnán.98 However, his thoughts were solely centered on the Guardian of
the Cause of God, and none other. May his spirit be gladdened.

He was very close to this servant. One day I said to him, “It would
be good if we made a pact and covenant with each other, and that would
be: If I leave this world before you, then I will come to your dream and
tell you of the condition of that world. And if you leave earlier, then you
do likewise in accordance with this pact and covenant.” He said, “Very
well. I accept.”

He passed away in the blessed House in Haifa during the blessed
days of the Guardian of the Cause of God. The Guardian of the Cause
of God was in attendance at the time of the funeral. The late Áqá ‘Alí-
Asghar,99 that faithful and sacrificial servant of the beloved Guardian of
the Cause of God, related, “Hájí Muhammad would say, ‘I want to go
and see where the Master went.’”

With his own blessed hand, he [Shoghi Effendi] placed a ring-
stone with the death verse inscribed upon it under his tongue,100 and

98 Shoghi Effendi’s father.
99 He is remembered as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s courier. He lived at the home of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá in Haifa, in the apartment on the right hand-side as one enters the main
entrance and passes by the side gardens. On hearing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s passing, he
was so overcome with emotion that he attempted suicide by cutting his own throat.
100 Regarding the deceased, Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-i Aqdas, p. 228, states, “and on

his finger should be placed a ring bearing the inscription ‘I came forth from God,

stated, “Lift Hájí Muhammad with the utmost respect. Hájí Muhammad
is most deserving of our esteem.”

After a few days, he appeared in my dream. I knew in that vision
that he had passed away and, therefore, said to him, “Hájí Muhammad, it
is time to fulfill your pledge.” He replied, “That is true, but I am not
permitted.” That is, he was not allowed to divulge the condition of that
world.

[Hájí Farhán]
There was a believer in Haifa by the name of Hájí Farhán, known as Hájí
Za‘allán and the Hindí. He spoke fluent Hindi with Indians. For a while,
he was united with the Covenant-breakers. According to what he related:

> One day the Covenant-breakers inquired, “Who would
> volunteer to go to India at his own expense in order to
> promote [our cause] there?” That is, promotion of the path
of darkness and misguidance.

They kept repeating this inquiry and I realized that
> they intended for me [to go to India], as there was no one
> else available to undertake this matter. Therefore, I
> volunteered and left ‘Akká, meaning the Mansion of Bahjí,
> which was the seat of the Covenant-breakers, for Haifa, so I
could board a ship leaving for India in three days.

Suddenly, I became gravely ill and pale in Haifa to the
> point that my plans and destination changed into being
admitted to a hospital.

Day after day, my condition grew worse, and all my
> organs were most afflicted. The physician had also
abandoned hope for my recovery.

After forty days of being bedridden and at the door of
> death, I became repentant and remorseful [over my
> opposition to the Covenant]. I began to cry. I felt sleep in
> that condition. I dreamt that the Master had come,

and return unto Him, detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the
Merciful, the Compassionate’ …”

> consoling me. He said, “We have bestowed health upon
you.”

When I woke, I sensed that all parts of my body had
> returned to their normal state, and that I was in perfect
health. I began to sob bitterly.

<p.170> The doctor came in and asked, “What has
> happened?” I said, “‘Abbás Effendi has bestowed health on
> me.” When he examined me, he discovered in the utmost
amazement that I was in perfect condition.

The Covenant-breakers came to visit me. I said to
> them, “From now on, I have nothing to do with you. All my
> illnesses and misfortunes were as result of your evil activities
and my own idol-worshiping.”

After receiving permission from His blessed presence
> [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], I left Haifa for ‘Akká and arrived to the
> sanctified presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. God only knows how
> that hour [of being with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] passed. The Master
> caressed and comforted me. At that moment, I felt as if I
> had entered paradise by way of hell.

He [Hájí Farhán] would also relate:

> Along with a group of [Muslim] pilgrims passing through
> the region, we attained the presence of the Blessed Beauty
> and were received on the ground floor of the Mansion of
> Bahjí. Bahá’u’lláh gave each of us a handful of nuql.101
> However, some of them, due to torpid and false ideas they
> entertained, threw out the nuql. I gathered all the nuql
> though.

In short, after he [Hájí Farhán] had established his home and
dwelling in Haifa, gradually over time he began to purchase the land on
the east side of the train-station, which at that time was outside the city
limits and away from the residences. He built a modest coffee shop on
the land he had acquired, as well as a home for his own use.
101   Nuql is a sweet, small Iranian candy.

Haifa’s City Hall, 1910

At the same time, he had begun to dig a well [in the courtyard]. He
was nearly at the end of the excavation, when, one day, he had filled the
basket with dirt to be pulled up by the laborer that was standing at the
top of the well, when by chance ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who at times, either on
foot or by carriage, would visit him, arrived on one such visit. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá came by the spot where he [Hájí Farhán] was working at the
bottom of the well, and stood by the well. Thinking that his laborer was
standing at the top of the well, the Hájí shouted with a loud voice,
“Pull.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá pulled on the rope and brought up the basket filled
with earth.

He related [the rest of the story] thus:

> From the bottom of the well, I saw the white skirt of an
> ‘abá, similar to ones His blessed Person would wear. With
> great anxiety, I came up. When my eyes fell upon His
blessed Temple, I was profoundly embarrassed.

It was winter at that time and the days of war, with tea
> and sugar being scarce. He inquired, “Do you have tea?” I
> said that I did not have any. He asked, “How about
> cinnamon?” I replied that I did not have cinnamon either
> and that I only had some ginger. He stated, “Brew that.”

Quickly, I put some [ginger] in a pot, boiled it, and
> took it before His blessed Self. He drank it with utmost
> pleasure.

After he had completed [the construction], he named it ‘Abbás
Land, and devoted all his belongings to the Cause. He was a benevolent
man and His blessed Person was well pleased with him. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
used to say, “Hájí Farhán is a good person.”

During the blessed days of the Guardian of the Cause of God, at
the time that the believers of the Holy Land were sent to other localities
and countries, he too was sent to Sur, which is a town in Syria. It was
there that he joined the Divine Bounty [i.e. passed away].

[A Story from Baghdad]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to relate, “In Baghdad, the friends had gathered and
had a delightful time. A certain Hájí was sitting in a corner, silent and
pensive. Áqá Ibráhím said to him [in verse]: ‘God has bestowed unto us
a mighty mansion, O thou suspicious Hájí, what thoughts dost thou
entertain?’” He would utter this poem with a smile.

In truth, if this suspicion did not exist among the believers in the
Cause of God, what bountiful happiness would surround us! We should
pray unto God to release everyone one from the grasp of this inclination.

[Muhammad-Javád Qazvíní]
One of the pillars of the Covenant-breakers was named Muhammad-
Javád <p.175> Qazvíní. When he strolled, he held his neck exceedingly
straight, particularly if he came upon the friends or His blessed Temple
[‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. ‘Abdul-Bahá would say, “He is like someone with a back
injury, and forced to hold his neck straight to ease the pain.”102

[Various Advices]

102   An approximate translation.

Regarding protection of one’s head, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “The head
must be covered. It will once again return to a turban.”103 His blessed
purpose was that the head should not be left uncovered, so it would be
immune from cold and heat. The interpretation of this is with physicians.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “A husband and wife who greatly love
each other, will be together in the next world also.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “There is no comfort in the world,
except in death.” He then added, “Sanctified is God! Even though
comfort is in death, they flee it.” That is, people do not wish to die.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “No matter how bad a government, it is
better than not having a government.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “If a brawl is taking place, do not tarry
there.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say to the effect, “After a head cold, when
you come out from the bath, eat watermelon to your fill.” The purpose
of His blessed Person was for emission and removal of heat.

He used also to say to this effect, “Diarrhea is beneficial for three
days as it eliminates vapors and heaviness of head. But if it was to last
longer, it would cause harm.” He would moreover state, “Diarrhea has
no medicine. [The cure is] only to skip a meal.”

He spoke of the benefits and influences of quinine.104 His blessed
purpose was that even though medicine will be replaced with nutrition
[for medicinal purposes], quinine would continue to remain.

[Visiting the Needy]
In the mornings, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would go visit the poor and the ill who
were unable to leave [their home] or move. The destitute who were
upholding their public image were aided in secret and stealthy. If a poor

103 The original term is ‘amámih, which typically refers to the type of turbans worn by
Iranian clergies.
104 Quinine is a natural white crystalline alkaloid having antipyretic (fever reducing),

anti-smallpox, analgesic (painkilling), and anti-inflammatory properties. Its main use
in ‘Akká of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s time was as an anti-malarial; for other reported
comments by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá regarding quinine see, Mu’ayyad, Eight Years near ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá: The Diary of Dr. Habíb Mu’ayyad, (Trans. Ahang Rabbani).

person had no family, had fallen ill and was bedridden so that no one
was there to care for him, then He [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] would appoint a nurse
for him until he regained his health.

This servant was twelve years old when for a few days I was
confined to bed due to an illness. At that time, we lived in the Khán
‘Avamíd, and the blessed residence [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] was in the House
of ‘Abdu’lláh Pashá. Suddenly, one early morning, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came
for a visit. With that melodious and enchanting voice, He said, “What is
wrong with Khalílu’lláh?” Immediately, I rose from bed and stood with
my hands folded over my chest. He took my pulse and pronounced,
“No, no, there is nothing wrong.” Then He paused and halted a little
and said, “Marhabá,” and departed.

These doings and the conduct of His blessed Person were all
considerably more effective and superior to mere words. All were
intended for the edification and education of the peoples of the world,
and an example for all humankind. Happy are the ones who succeed in
tracing and following in His footstep. Otherwise, that Master of both
worlds was sanctified and beyond such considerations.

[Persepolis]
One night there was a gathering in the blessed House of ‘Akká. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá spoke about Takht Jamshíd, which is also written as sacred Text.
His blessed purpose was that the Bahá’ís should return [Persepolis] to its
original condition, and develop and beautify it. He stated, “I cherish this
hope.”105

[Reading]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, “Books are for reading, not for storage in a
container.” <p.180> His purpose was that from reading and studying
benefits would be realized; otherwise, it is the same as its absence.

105 This appears to be a summary of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s exposition on Persepolis, which
is given in a talk on 18 July 1915. For ease of reference, that talk is provided in
Appendix 6 in translation.

[Witchcraft]
[A question about] the nature of magic and witchcraft was asked of the
blessed presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He responded, “It has influence, but
its impact later returns to the original person.” His intent was that a
person would be seized by his own evil machinations.

[The Lukewarm]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say about those lukewarm in the Cause of God, “If
I was to administer the least admonishment to any of them, they would
take the path of the Mansion.”106 However, regarding those constant in
the Cause of God, He would say, “If I force them to leave through the
door, they would come in by the window.” The purpose of His blessed
Person was that, if He did not conduct Himself with wisdom and
compassion, then the weak in constitution who had encircled His
blessed Person would join the Covenant-breakers. Since in those days
the pivot of rebellion and his cohorts were residing in the Mansion of
Bahjí, He stated, “They would take the path of the Mansion.”

Praise be unto God that today, out of the power and sovereignty
of the beloved and appointed Guardian of the Cause of God, the
Mansion has become the point of adoration of all who are under the
shade of Bahá.

However, regarding those who are firm and constant in the divine
Covenant and Testament, no matter how angrily or heatedly He spoke
with them, they would bow more to His sanctified Threshold, would
grow more in humility and meekness, and burn brighter by the fire of
the love of God’s Proof, and more eagerly seek His good-pleasure. It is
why He would say, “If I force them to leave through the door, they
would come in by the window.” Blessed are those who arrive at this state
and sustain this manner.

[Serving Others]
106At that time, Mansion of Bahjí was the seat of the family of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá who
had rebelled against Him.

In some festivals and commemorations, after the meal ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
would pour water for each guest and visitor from a jug among the
pitchers which were common in those days – as there was no better
facility for washing hands and faces. In such a way, each believer and
attendee would wash his hands and face. He would provide this service
in the highest point of perfection for every person, whether lowly or
noble, without any exception.

This demands our reflection and pondering! When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
that Master of both worlds, stood to service to such a degree, then surely
the duty of us, who are naught but servants of that Threshold, is clear
and well evident.

[Some Answered Questions]
In consideration of His many responsibilities, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá revealed the
sacred Kitáb Mufávidát [Some Answered Questions] only at lunchtime. It
was in this manner: after all others commenced lunch, His blessed
Person would pace on one side of the table, back and forth, rather
deliberately, and answer questions raised by Miss Barney.

Laura and Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney in 1906

One day, on the upper apartment of the House of ‘Abdu’lláh
Pashá, a number of pilgrims and resident believers were the guests of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. After ensuring that food was served to each guest and that
everyone was partaking of the meal, He commenced to reveal answers to
questions [of Miss Barney], which were put to Him one after another.
The power of utterance and deduction, which exclusively belongs to the
Manifestations of the Truth, was most evident and apparent.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Eating Habits]
After He sat at table, although different forms of dishes were at hand, he
took three or four mouthfuls of bread and cheese, and then He left.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá ate little. He used to say to this effect, “When I eat, I
become heavy and cannot work. However, if I do not eat, then My vigor
is diminished. There is no choice; something must be consumed.”

[Correspondence]
At the time of responding to the missives sent from diverse corners of
the world to the blessed presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, they were opened in
order, an answer was composed immediately and the secretary would
take the dictation. <p.185> When it was completed, He would tear up
the missive into pieces and would open another envelope. It would go in
thus manner until the end – even though there was no end.

The Pen of the Center of the Covenant wrote some of the
responses.

One day in Haifa, at the time of such compositions, I was in
attendance. It was a particular condition. After I had greatly enjoyed the
experience, He said, “Fí amánu’lláh!”

At the time of the revelation of divine verses, Tablets and prayers,
the majesty of His blessed Person became a hundredfold.

One day in Haifa, a group of the ‘urafá [mystics] were in the
blessed presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. As His blessed Temple spoke with
them, He was engaged in writing. The situation unfolded in such a way
that He read that text [He had just written] to them, which was extensive

and detailed, and composed in utmost eloquence and fluency in Arabic.
They were most bewildered as to how it was possible for Him to be
engaged in conversation, giving answers to their questions and inquiries,
and at the same time compose such remarkable text and prose. Indeed
God was with Him, but they were bereft of recognizing that His power
was beyond any human abilities.107

[Bahá’u’lláh Revealing Tablets]
The paternal uncle of this servant, Áqá Muhammad-Hasan, who was the
custodian of the pilgrim house, used to relate:

> One day, the Ancient Beauty – His exalted Name is supreme
> – was pacing and revealing divine verses. Even though
> Mírzá Áqá Ján, who was His amanuensis and skilled in
> writing rapidly, was leaving many words without their
> required dots, nevertheless he [could not keep up], stopped
> and started crying. Meanwhile, divine verses were pouring
forth like capacious rain.

Suddenly, that Promised Beauty became aware of his
> condition and inquired, “How far were you able to write?”
> When he stated [how far], Bahá’u’lláh responded, “From the
> beginning, it was the most great renewal,108 since this
> unbounded and unrestrained power was solely appointed to
> this mighty Manifestation.”

Moreover, he [Áqá Muhammad-Hasan] also used to relate, “One
day it was inquired of the presence of the Blessed Beauty, ‘From which
direction should the pilgrims return home?’ He responded, ‘The station
of the Godhead is the revelation of divine verses.’”109

107 A more detailed version of this occurrence is told by Afnán, Memories of the Báb,
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, (trans. Ahang Rabbani).
108 The original qiyámat kubrá can also be rendered as the most great resurrection or

revolution.
109 The implication being that certain questions were not worthy of the time and

attention of Bahá’u’lláh. Related to this, the Báb had specifically admonished His

[The Next Manifestation]
At all events, the proof of Manifestationhood up to this mighty and
perfect Dispensation, which in no wise can be compared to the previous
Appearances, has been the revelation of divine verses.110 Moreover, this
proof was concluded with this supreme Manifestation of God, since the
Ancient Beauty states, “Ere this Manifestation, Verses alone had been
the proof unto all.” Then He states, “For in this Manifestation, God –
glorified be His mention – hath willed that most of the believers and the
sincere ones should give utterance to Verses; whence in the next
Dispensation We shall ordain a different matter as proof, lest all who
speak in this fashion should show pride towards God, the All-Powerful,
the All-Compelling, the Almighty;”111 until the end of His sweet
statement.

By clear and explicit divine verses, it is evident and plain that when
the Proof of the next Manifestation appears, it will not be by divine
verses.112 Moreover, that Appearance will be after the completion of a
full thousand years.

According to the statement of the Interpreter of God’s verses –
that is, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Center of divine Covenant and Testament –
the guidance for the present thousand-year manifestation is provided by
followers not to ask questions from Him Whom God shall make manifest – Whom
for the Bahá’ís is fulfilled in Bahá’u’lláh – so that He would be free to address more
exalted themes, such as, His own station.
110 Bahá’u’lláh states (Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 104), “Say: The first

and foremost testimony establishing His truth is His own Self. Next to this
testimony is His Revelation. For whoso faileth to recognize either the one or the
other He hath established the words He hath revealed as proof of His reality and
truth. This is, verily, an evidence of His tender mercy unto men. He hath endowed
every soul with the capacity to recognize the signs of God.”
111 For ease of reference, this Tablet is provided in Appendix 2 in provisional

translation. Appendix 3 provides Nabíl Zarandí’s recollections of Bahá’u’lláh’s
utterances.
112 This statement may need to be reconciled with other texts from Bahá’u’lláh,

where it is implied that revelation of divine verses will always be one of the proofs;
see       for      instance,      La’alí      Hikmat,        vol.       2,     pp.      39;

the Blessed Beauty. For an exposition and explanation of these
statements, refer to Kitáb Rahíq Makhtúm, volume one.113

[Warning Against Claims]
The point is that whenever individuals like the shameless Yahyá [Azal] or
the pivot of rebellion the greater firewood [Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí], or
others advance such claims, or assert Prophethood, then according to
the firm text and the decree of the heaven of the divine will, it is absolute
falsehood, complete fabrication and thorough polytheism, and stems
from misguidance and shamelessness. Likewise, [this is true of] anyone
who makes a claim to the Guardianship, like the perished and base
Remey.114 This is because in accordance with the firm and irrefutable
divine text <p.190> revealed in [‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s] Will and Testament, the
next Guardian must be a descendant of the Guardian of the Cause of
God. That is, he must be an offspring of the blessed temple [of Shoghi
Effendi]. Otherwise, he is not someone whom we would consider as the
Guardian of the Cause, nor is he specific, explicit, appointed or known
as such, and “be as sweet as he is.”

The Guardian of the Cause of God must appoint and designate
the next Guardian, officially and personally. For example, in the Will and
Testament, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in an explicit text appointed Shoghi Effendi
Rabbani, the chosen branch, as the Guardian of the Cause of God and
the authority over the people of Bahá.

Now, if a person advances such a claim that, for instance, he is an
offspring of the Guardian of the Cause of God, and in truth even
entitled to the Guardianship, since the Guardian of the Cause of God
has not appointed him in an explicit text without hints or allusions, then
he would not be acceptable to the people of Bahá. How much truer this
is in case of the crazed Remey and men like him, who are miles and

113 Ishráq-Khávarí, Rahíq Makhtúm, v. 1, Iran, 130 BE, in 762 pages. This book is a
commentary on Shoghi Effendi’s Centennial Letter (known as Lawh Qarn) to the
Bahá’ís of the East.
114 This narrative was composed shortly after the expulsion of Charles Mason

Remey from the Bahá’í community because of his unfounded claim to be Shoghi
Effendi’s successor and the next Guardian.

scores [of miles] away from the principal Tree. Delusion can be
attributed to such individuals.

In the sacred Kitáb-i Aqdas, which is the authority over all the
people of Bahá, the establishment and formation of the Universal House
of Justice is neither conditioned nor related to the presence of the
Guardian of the Cause, so that this can be made into a source of
complaint or protest. Rather, this [i.e. membership of the Guardian on
the Universal House of Justice] is an exposition enshrined in the Will and
Testament. However, the absence of its fulfillment is not a reason for
denying or disallowing the establishment and formation of the Universal
House of Justice, or – and I take refuge with God – a reason for its
invalidity.

The most that can be said is that mighty mysteries are enshrined
and concealed in this, in which at present one of those wisdoms can be
observed. That is: certain ambitious, foolish and lukewarm [individuals]
in the Cause of God, and outside of the straight divine path, are thereby
subjected to test and trial, and unaware and lost, they traverse the field of
darkness.

One day ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “It is not necessary to wait for the
Universal House of Justice to be formed at a time when all have
embraced the Faith. It must take place when a portion of the people
have come under the shadow of the Cause of God.” He did not specify
any other condition.

He would say, “The plan of God is mysterious.” He would also
add, “Odd or even, we will win.”115

[Tests]
One day in the birúní [outer section] of the blessed House of Haifa, He
[‘Abdu’l-Bahá] stated, “I have forgotten my handkerchief.” One of the
friends who was known as Ustád Muhammad-‘Alí Banná, remarked to
this effect, “How is it possible for the manifestation of Truth to forget

115Odd or even is an expression used in rolling the dice in the game of backgammon.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement implies that regardless of crisis and misfortunes visiting
the humanity, God’s plan will ultimately triumph.

anything?” Immediately, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá slapped him and stated, “Over
forgetting a handkerchief that man puts a hundred souls to test.”

Recently, this same person was excommunicated during the
blessed days of the Guardian of the Cause of God and, dejected and
remorseful, left this world.

The point is that such people are bereft of God and unaware of
His plans. “And for them is naught save hell and its fire.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá was speaking in the blessed House of Haifa about
the evil deeds of a person and stated, “I will not mention his name.”
This blessed utterance demonstrated that such individuals are not worthy
of mention or introduction, since the decree of evanescence and
nothingness governs over them.

[The Hands of the Cause]
The Hands of the Cause of God – upon them rest the Glory of God, the
Most Glorious – have each been appointed and designated through the
sovereign will and the encompassing decree of the beloved and the
chosen Guardian of the Cause of God, <p.195> whose will is the same
as God’s will and decree. Therefore, they are representative of his
blessed person and stand to fulfill his wishes. They are considered and
ascribed as the foremost learned in Bahá. Therefore, there is no doubt or
reservation left to anyone with discernment that their love-motivated
decision to establish and form the Universal House of Justice, and
achieve such a bountiful success, the likes of which has never occurred
before and will ever happen again, is by the inspiration and confirmation
of Almighty God, and in accordance with the firm text. Their very
success is manifest and clear evidence, since God has eternally been
protector, supporter and sustainer of His Cause and will ever remain so.
Therefore, no one can deny the services and mighty undertakings of
these sanctified souls, who night and day stood devoted to the Cause,
diffused the divine fragrances, and guided the inhabitants of earth and all
who dwell in various corners and continents.

Remey is also a Hand of the Cause, or was a Hand, and committed
that which is the essence of inequity and most unconscionable. His
deeds demonstrated that a dead branch is worthy of fire, much the same

as the Greater Branch [Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí] became the greater
firewood116 and was sent to the eternal infernal fire. In addition, many
like him have found their way to the lowest abyss. Therefore, we should
know with absolute certainty that such individuals who raise claims are
outside the Cause of God and the straight path of the Lord, and suffer
from mental disturbance. Consequently, in utmost misery and
wretchedness, like the ill-wishing Covenant-breakers, they spend their
time, and at the end will join them. “And this is the reward of their
deeds,” unless they remove their hands from their evil doings and,
penitent and remorseful, return [to the fold].

[An Incident at the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh]
One year during the blessed days of Guardian of the Cause of God, a
large number of pilgrims and resident believers were at hand for the
commemoration of the Ascension of the Blessed Perfection. Everyone
was gathered and present in the garden of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, and
with great sorrow and hearts set on fire, was engaged in reciting divine
verses and prayers in accordance with his blessed instruction.

At that time, a number of women Covenant-breakers who were in
the Mansion entered the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, but their visitation was
prolonged. It appeared that intentionally they did not wish to exit, so
that there would not be an opportunity for the friends of God to enter
the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. Since the time and hour of visitation was
passing and all were waiting for their departure, the Guardian of the
Cause of God stated [to the Shrine’s custodian], “Tell them to come
out.” However, they did not pay any attention and manifested enmity.

Thereupon, by his own sacred self, the Guardian of the Cause of
God rose and entered the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, instructing them to
leave. The greatness and grandeur of his person forcefully precipitated
the exit of that seditious band. At the time of departure, one of the
woman Covenant-breakers had said, “May my life be a sacrifice for the
Most Mighty Branch [‘Abdu’l-Bahá].” Her intent by uttering this remark

116Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí was styled by Bahá’u’lláh as the Greater Branch. After his
break with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, some referred to him as the greater firewood, a play on
words.

was to express her meekness, meaning, “Wrong was perpetrated against
us.”

The Guardian of the Cause of God said to the friends who had
been standing outside waiting for the opportunity to enter [the Shrine],
“Walk around a little until these persons leave.”

Next year, when like the year before, they wanted to enter the
Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, the Guardian instructed, “Do not allow them in.”
At that time, one of the friends of God who was among the resident
believers of that region, whose name was Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rahmán Ardikání,
and who presently resides in Amman [Jordan], stood outside the Shrine
as a guard.117 With a resonant voice, the Guardian of the Cause of God
announced, “‘Abdu’r-Rahmán, do not allow them to enter.” He
informed them [the Covenant-breakers], “Instructions have been receive
to prevent <p.200> your entrance. It is not possible.”

In such manner, they received the punishment for their conduct of
the previous year.

During the course of these events, ‘Alí-Ridá, who was one of the
pillars of the Covenant-breakers, from afar, that is, outside of the
assembly of the friends, had murmured about the possession and seizing
[of the Shrine] and had immediately disappeared from the scene. Later,
this incident was printed in the newspaper, stating in essence, “They
deprived us from visiting our Father.” However, no one heeded their
writings or empty words.

Later, they were completely prevented from entering the Shrine of
Bahá’u’lláh. And this was naught but through the power and might of
the “perspicuous serpent.”118 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had taken an oath that He
would appear with the perspicuous serpent. Therefore, this divine
serpent so thoroughly uprooted the Covenant-breakers, and eliminated
and destroyed them, that forever they will be unable to rise or be
reestablished.

117 ‘Abdu’r-Rahmán and his two younger brothers, Subhí and Khalíl, lived for some
time in Haifa, where Khalíl was in service to the Faith. The two former brothers
lived for some years in Jaffa, before Shoghi Effendi sent them to Jordan. Khalíl’s
daughter, Rúhíyyih, lives presently in Haifa in the same house as her father’s.
(Hossein Achtchi, private communications, 10 March 2008.)
118 See discussion of the “perspicuous serpent” earlier in this narrative.

[Sádhijih]
Mírzá Badí‘u’lláh had given his daughter, Sádhij, in marriage to the
owner of the Karmel Newspaper, who was an old man, a Christian, and
whose name was Nassar.119 Even though they presented themselves as
Muslims, this deed [i.e. marriage to a Christian] was against Islamic
jurisprudence.

Najib Nassar

‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to the effect, “They asked Mírzá Muhammad-
‘Alí (the arch-Covenant-breaker) of the station and rank of Bahá’u’lláh.
He said, ‘My Father was a Dervish.’”

119 Born to a Greek Orthodox family in Tiberius, Najib al-Khuri Nassar (1865-1948)
converted to Protestantism while working for 15 years in a hospital run by
missionaries. He then worked briefly as a land sales agent for the Jewish
Colonization Association before founding the daily newspaper al-Karmil in 1908 in
Haifa. Nassar used his knowledge of land sales to Jews to write articles against the
Jewish settlers and the first history of the Zionist movement in Arabic, Zionism: Its
History, Object and Importance. Before World War I, he founded several activist
organizations to limit Jewish immigration and land sales. Al-Karmil was closed
permanently by court order in 1944. Nassar died in Nazareth. See, Mandel, Neville
J. The Arabs and Zionism before World War I. Berkeley: University of California Press,
1976\.

At any rate, their purpose from so doing [marriage of Sádhij with
Nassar] was that whenever they wanted, they could publish their
falsehoods, lies and fabrications against ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Center of
divine Covenant and Testament, and that Karmel Newspaper would be
at their disposal. “O regret for such deeds!”

At the end, they were seized by the greatest misery and were
thoroughly obliterated.120

[Mírzá Asadu’lláh Isfahání]
There was a certain Mírzá Asadu’lláh, a native of Isfahan. He was related
to the members of the blessed household.121 From a distance, some new

arrivals would mistake his appearance for the blessed temple of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. This was because in clothing, attire, style of beard and turban –
and I take refuge unto God! – he appeared to look like ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
For this reason, some would mistake this imitator [for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
from a distance and would bow down, which would please him.
However, when the visitors learned of their error, they would be sad and
disturbed. Sanctified is God! What wickedness is this and what false
imaginings!

At last he was dismissed and left for America. It was there that his
life ended.

[Refinement]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to tie a white cloth around His inner cap and His
blessed head. Even though He did so with utmost speed, it was
extremely refined and methodical, such that others, no matter how much
time they spent, were never able to replicate His manner.

One time the Guardian of the Cause of God was instructing how
the sheets designed to spread over the mandars [“benches”] in the blessed
House of Haifa were to be cut. The Greatest Holy Leaf, the Liege Lady
of the people of Bahá, stated, “How have you learned such things?” He
replied, “By deductive reasoning.”

It is certain that it is so, since the manifestations of God are
themselves the essence of logic.

[Simplicity]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “If not for the grandeur of the Cause, I would
not even wear this attire;” even though His blessed appearance was most
simple. That is, it consisted of a long garment and a thin overcoat. In
winters, He would add a cotton ‘abá. Even then, when He came upon a
destitute person in His path, He would bestow the ‘abá on him.

121Mírzá Asadu’lláh had married the sister of Munírih Khánum, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
wife. He rendered notable services to the Faith, including the transfer of the Báb’s
remains from Iran to the Holy Land. However, later he followed his son, Dr.
Fareed, in rebellion against ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and was excommunicated.

Therefore, from His blessed utterance it can be discerned that
clothing is only for the purpose of covering the body, and one must not
be attracted to lavishness.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “If one’s clothing has a patch, there is
no harm. But it must be clean.”

One of the servants of the blessed House was Bashír. He passed
away in Haifa <p.205> in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s residence.122 He was
exceedingly devoted and interested in the cleanliness of his headgear and
its presentation. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to him, “Do not be so excessively
concerned with spotlessness of your hat.” That is, every undertaking, no
matter how desirable, has limits.

At one time in Iran, the government forbade the wearing of the
‘abá. The Guardian of the Cause of God stated, “The ‘abá is a good
thing.”

[Sweetmeat]
During the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, one day a number of Iranian
pilgrims were invited for lunch to the blessed House in Haifa. At
lunchtime, this servant also attained unto this bounty. Among the food
items and various dishes on the table, there were plates filled with
bámiyih.123 This particular sweetmeat was not common at that time in
Iran, and indeed did not exist. Therefore, the pilgrims were hesitant in
partaking of them. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “This is bámiyih. It is a natural
laxative and reduces the bile.124” After this remark, they were favored
with great appetite and much enjoyment, with coincided with
considerable cheers and delight.
122 On the manner of unfortunate incident leading to Bashír’s death see, Mu’ayyad,
Eight Years near ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: The Diary of Dr. Habíb Mu’ayyad, (trans. Ahang
Rabbani).
123 A confection resembling the shape of okra.
124 The original term safrá is yellow bile (sometimes called ichor), which together

with black bile were two of the four vital fluids or humors of ancient and medieval
Islamic and European medicine (the other two were phlegm and blood). The Latin
name for yellow bile gave rise to the word choler. Excessive yellow bile was supposed
to produce an aggressive temperament, known as choleric. The word bilious refers
especially to a temperament produced by an excess of black bile.

[Bahiyyih Khánum]
During the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, suddenly the Greatest Holy
Leaf, the Liege Lady of the people of Bahá – may my soul be a sacrifice
unto her meekness – became ill and bedridden. Smilingly, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
said to His illustrious sister, “Do what you wish, but I have work for
you.” That is, “If you wish to depart this world, for now suspend that
idea, as there is much work that remains which you must shoulder.”

In truth, the veracity of His blessed utterance became evident after
His ascension when it was observed what significant and critical matters
were entrusted to her.125 In this regard, the beloved Guardian of the
Cause of God has written extensively.

125During the first decade of Shoghi Effendi’s ministry, Bahíyyih Khánum often
served as the Head of the Faith during the Guardian’s absence from Haifa.

Whether during the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, or during the
blessed period of the Guardian of the Cause of God, the Greatest Holy
Leaf was their principal representative.126 Night and day, she was
engaged in service within and outside the Cause, administration of daily
affairs of the household, serving as host to friends and strangers by her
own sacred self, and many other matters and affairs that remain
unnumbered and unaccounted. All of this while she was brokenhearted
over the infidelity, deeds and activities of the Covenant-breakers both in
[the Holy Land] and outside. These things brought much harm to her
tender and delicate person. Nevertheless, she endured it all with the
utmost dignity, calm, patience, fortitude, serenity and composure. She
was a singular friend and companion to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the Guardian
of the Cause of God. Except each [of these luminous figures] had their
own sphere of responsibility, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s was so extensive that
He would say, “I must even think of the hay and fodder for the horses.”

> The Greatest Holy Leaf was the treasure house of mysteries.127

When Arab ladies were invited to the blessed House of Haifa, and
a gathering held in the evening, coinciding with this servant having the
bounty of attaining as well, then word would be sent [by Bahiyyih
Khánum] that I should chant Arabic prayers. It was mentioned to her
sanctified presence, “That person [i.e. Khalíl Shahídí] chants well.” She
had responded, “He chants eloquently.” This was yet another bounty
upon this hapless and unworthy servant.

At the time of her ascension, she was looking heavenwards saying,
“Very well. Wait, I am coming.” It was evident that from the world
above that the spirits of the Concourse on High, impatiently and with
great fervor, were anticipating the arrival of the pure and sanctified soul
of that remnant of God and trust of Bahá, which propelled her to speak
such words of assurance to them.

126 The original na‘amu’l-vakíl implies more than being the principal representative or
prime confidant and suggests a standing as the deputy or principal substitute.
127 Another reading of makhzan asrár is vault of secrets. While it is true that Bahiyyih

Khánum was entrusted with the most confidential matters of the Faith, such as
being charged with secretly housing the remains of the Báb in her room for over a
decade, it appears that the intent of the narrator by asrár refers more to spiritual
mysteries.

The Greatest Holy Leaf was extremely sympathetic, <p.210> kind
and compassionate. With great care, she would inquire of the minute
details of all affairs and would administer every enterprise. She would
bring about the healing of every ill and unwell person, would give timely
advice and counsel, and guide every wayward one. Whenever someone
would speak of God, she would immediately utter words of affirmation.

In truth, she was the solver of every difficulty and the tender
friend of the people of Bahá.

[Mount Carmel]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to praise and admire the vivifying effect of the air of
Mount Carmel. For instance, He would say to this effect, “Whatever
problem that a person may have, if he was to stroll a little in that air and
think about his problem, a solution would be presented. Whoever wants
to live a long life should live there.”

He would also say to this effect, “From the perspective of its
natural beauty and pleasantness, it is preferable to all other locations.”

The Guardian of the Cause of God used also to greatly extol
[Mount Carmel], particularly the spot where the Shrine of the Exalted
One is located.

[Ottoman Military]
Prior to the intervention of the British government, the Ottoman
authorities had decided to draft the Iranian youth residing in that region
into their military and began that process. However, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
influence prevented this.

At that time in ‘Akká, He instructed this servant to go to the
pilgrim house of the Shrine of the Exalted One [the Báb] so that I would
be away from the eyes of the authorities. Therefore until such time as the
eminent British government arrived [in the Holy Land], I was staying
and serving at the pilgrim house of the Shrine of the Exalted One.

[Mullá Abú-Tálib Badkubih’í]

There was a certain Mullá Abú-Tálib, who was a native of Badkubih,
whose age was in excess of one hundred and ten years.128 In accordance
with the blessed instruction [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], he resided in one of the
rooms on the lower floor of the pilgrim house. He was deeply faithful,
had great certitude, and was the recipient of attention and bounties of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He was happy, thankful and appreciative for the sweet
humor of His blessed Person.

One day ‘Abdu’l-Bahá visited his room. After He had inquired of
his health, he [Mullá Abú-Tálib] had said, “Since I do not have any
companions, I am lonely.” At that point, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá summoned me
and stated, “Each day, you must sit and for two hours converse with
Mullá Abú-Tálib.”

After a few days, he said to the blessed presence [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá],
“I am most pleased with him [Khalíl Shahídí].” He responded, “‘Abdu’l-
Bahá is also pleased with him.”

One day he had submitted [to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], “If You grant
permission, I would like to go for a few days to the Ridván Garden.” He
responded, “What for? Stay here.” However, since he wished to go, He
replied further, “Very well.”

> Two or three days later, he passed away in the Ridván Garden.

Thereupon, in accordance with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s blessed instruction,
a number of the friends from Haifa proceeded to the Ridván Garden for
his funeral procession. This servant was in their company as well.

His resting-place was in the Bahá’í cemetery of ‘Akká. However, it
was among the graves that were not yet built. Since there were no
numbers [on the graves], its location is unknown.

128He accepted the Faith through Nabíl’s efforts and became the first Bahá’í in the
Caucasus; Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p. 176. “Two doors, one facing north
towards ‘Akká and the other on the eastern side of the Shrine, are named for Ustád
Áqá ‘Alí-Ashraf and Ustád Áqá Bálá, sons of Mullá Abu-Tálib. These two brothers
were master masons who went on pilgrimage from their native town of Baku,
Russia [now Azerbaijan], and with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s permission remained for some
time in the Holy Land. During this period, they devoted their efforts to the
construction of the Shrine and offered financial contributions towards the project”;
Ugo Giachery, Shoghi Effendi - Recollections, p. 214.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “If Mullá Abú-Tálib had not gone [to
the Ridván Garden], he would have lived a while longer.” His blessed
point was to praise the refreshing air of Mount Carmel.

[Tobacco]
According to what this servant has heard from those that beheld the
Countenance of the Lord [i.e. Bahá’u’lláh], one day during the time of
the Blessed Perfection – may His mention be supreme – a group of the
believers in God gathered in the Ridván Garden.

Suddenly, they learned of the arrival of the Blessed Beauty. At that
time, one of them was smoking a waterpipe. Immediately, he concealed
it in the tall and thick bushes. Upon arrival, the Temple of the Truth –
that all-knower of hidden and visible – had proceeded directly to the
spot where the waterpipe was hidden, <p.215> and stated, “This is why
God has forbidden its use.”

During the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, when different visitors
would arrived in His sanctified presence, some would present Him with
cigarettes. In order to please them, the blessed Temple would accept
them. One day, He remarked to the Greatest Holy Leaf, “Khánum, they
insist on giving cigarettes to us. My chest has developed aches. I am in
pain.”

One night, there was a gathering in the blessed House of ‘Akká
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá uttered words to this effect, “It is strange. Even
though everyone knows the harm of cigarettes, yet people consume
them. Civilization will advance to a point one day that they will say, ‘Why
did previous generations use cigarettes which are so harmful?’ This will
greatly puzzle them.”

When Lawh Dukhán was revealed by the pen of the Center of the
divine Covenant and Testament,129 even though Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl was an
old man and deeply addicted to the use of tobacco, to the point that he
would light his cigarette with the previous one, nevertheless he

129 Lawh Dukhán was composed in honor of Muhammad-Husayn Vakíl. It is known
in the West as the Tablet of Purity and is published in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections from
the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, pp. 145-50. Smoking is not forbidden in the Bahá’í Faith,
but ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has discouraged it for the sake of health and cleanliness.

immediately threw his cigarette case and accessories through the window
and announced, “From now on, separation between me and you
[tobacco]!”

Similarly, many other elders of the Faith, both men and women,
[suspended the use of tobacco], even though the intent was for the
younger members to come to their senses, since the Blessed Perfection
has exempted the older ones from this injunction. In truth, this
ordinance was aimed at the youth so they would purify and cleanse
themselves.130 Nevertheless, it was the elders who pioneered in their
obedience.

Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí also abandoned the use of tobacco.

However, since he was frail and unwell, he became severely ill. No
matter how much the physician insisted, he refused to resume his
smoking. It went thus until that compassionate and kind Master gave
him permission [to smoke] and exempted him from this [prohibition].
After that permission, he would halve his cigarettes and of that half,
would smoke only a half – and even that was out of obedience to the
wishes of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

…131

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Health]
130 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states the following in Lawh Dukhán (Selections from the Writings of
‘Abdu’l-Baha, p. 147):

> The Báb, at the outset of His mission, explicitly prohibited tobacco,
> and the friends one and all abandoned its use. But since those were
> times when dissimulation was permitted, and every individual who
> abstained from smoking was exposed to harassment, abuse and even
> death – the friends, in order not to advertise their beliefs, would
> smoke. Later on, the Book of Aqdas was revealed, and since smoking
> tobacco was not specifically forbidden there, the believers did not
> give it up. The Blessed Beauty, however, always expressed repugnance
> for it, and although, in the early days, there were reasons why He
> would smoke a little tobacco, in time He completely renounced it,
> and those sanctified souls who followed Him in all things also
> abandoned its use.

131 A small paragraph pertaining to the private life of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is left

untranslated.

If we were to overlook certain illnesses and infirmities that would
sometimes visit His blessed Temple – most of which were caused and
brought about by the Covenant-breakers – His blessed Person was in
excellent health.

The arch-Covenant-breaker [Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí] was
remorseful over this matter. One day ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, out of wisdom and
by design, said to him, “After Me, it will be you.” He responded, “It is
not certain.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said no more to him. In truth, he lived after
the blessed ascension [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], but his life was like death.132

If ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s will and decree had not ordained His ascension,
He would have stayed longer in this world, since His sanctified being
was bereft of any illness or decease. However, God’s inscrutable wisdom
decreed as it occurred.

[Card Playing]
The blessed presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was asked about playing cards
with no intention of gambling. He replied, “It is a waste of time.”

This blessed utterance demonstrated that from such proclivities,
not only would a person squander his time, but he may gradually be
drawn to gambling as well, <p.220> and be distanced from sincerity and
spirituality.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá Watering the Gardens]
During the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, at the time of the World War
[I], the garden at the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh was watered by a hand pump
installed in the garden. Whenever it was possible, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would go
and pump water with His blessed hands while whispering prayers.133

For a long time before installation of this pump, indeed for many
years, the garden of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh was watered using large jars
known as jarrah, or with large tin cans, from an aqueduct that passed by

Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí passed away in 1937, some 16 years after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

\[132\] 
For more details see, Mu’ayyad, Eight Years near ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: The Diary of Dr.

\[133\] 
Habíb Mu’ayyad, (trans. Ahang Rabbani).

the spruce-fir trees across from the Shrine – this waterway was known as
Áb-i Kábarí. It was through this method that the garden was irrigated.

On the days devoted to general visitation [of the Shrine], using
jarrahs built by my father, Ustád Abú’l-Qásim, which some of the friends
of God had donated to the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, the believers would
collectively participate in carrying water from the aqueduct to irrigate the
garden in accordance with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s instructions.

My father was responsible for filling each of the jarrahs with water
from the aqueduct. After filling ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s jarrah, my father would
dry the jar with a towel and then softly place it over ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
shoulder, in accordance with His wish.

This process would continue a number of times, and they would
go back and forth, until the garden was fully irrigated.134

At all events, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá – the Master of the people of Bahá –
would manifest and demonstrate such a degree of submissiveness and
servitude to the Threshold of the Blessed Perfection, so that His deeds
would be an example for all who profess belief in Bahá.

[Financial]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, “Having no money is arduous. But too much of
it also causes difficulties.” The truth of this utterance is clear and evident
unto every man of discernment. His purpose was moderation in earning
a livelihood.

[An Attempt to Defraud ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
During the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, several authorities of the
Ottoman government who worked in an office in ‘Akká decided,
through deceit and trickery, to force ‘Abdu’l-Bahá into paying a large and
significant sum that they had in mind. However, that essence of
generosity and favor [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] would never give a single coin to
anyone as a bribe or in fear.

134Four lines at the top of page 222 are crossed out beyond readability. They appear
to recount an insulting comment by one of the Covenant-breakers.

They selected one of their own to go before His blessed Person to
implement their evil and wrong-headed plan. When he arrived [before
‘Abdu’l-Bahá], he spoke facts that were manufactured and resided
outside the truth, all intended to [cause] harm and loss to the Cause. This
representative spoke to this effect, “The government has decided to do
this or that [action against the Faith], but it is possible through a
payment of such an amount to prevent the government from taking this
action.” His entire presentation to the end was such unsound and untrue
statements.

Thereupon, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sought water to perform His ablution.

With the utmost deliberation, He completed His ablution and then
commenced to perform the long obligatory prayer of the Muslims.
During His prayer, the man kept interrupting, “This matter must
<p.225> be concluded quickly, as there is little time!” Meaning that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá should end His obligatory prayer and attend to this urgent
matter.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá finished His prayer, with the utmost dignity and
authority He came close to him and slapped him several times, saying, “I
sent it for you.”

With great stress and anxiety, never having imagined such an
outcome, he held his face and head, and shouting, screaming and
roaring, he returned to the government office and informed his
comrades of what had transpired.

That very night telegraphs in Turkish were received from the
Sublime Port [Istanbul] for each one of them, signed by one of the
eminent and distinguished personages in the [Central] government.
These telegraphs dismissed each one of them from office and further
instructed them to kiss the hand of ‘Abbás Effendi.

This incident heightened the wonder and astonishment of every
high and low citizen, marveling how and when ‘Abbás Effendi had
informed Istanbul so that at such an hour of the night dismissal orders
were dispatched. Of course, in view of their lack of faith, they were right
to wonder in this regard.

Those around these men became deeply frightened and perturbed,
and for this reason hastened to the presence of His blessed Person and
through this act expressed their humility, beseeching His good-pleasure.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, “I am sitting in this room, but I spin the
world around My little finger.” His purpose by this comment was that
the sovereign will and abiding decree of His sanctified being was the
same as the will and decree of God.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Generosity]
One day ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was at Jámi‘ Jazzár [al-Jazzár mosque] and a group
of eminent citizens were in His presence. One of the inhabitants of
‘Akká arrived and whispered [to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], “My wife has just given
birth and I have no money.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gave him a five lira gold coin.
With that, he prepared all the necessary provisions. When the people
that were aware of his meager situation inquired, he responded, “This
alleviated situation is out of the favors and bounties of His Holiness
‘Abbás Effendi.”

The generosity, munificence, mercy and benevolence of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá surrounded every deserving person.

[The Seed of the Next Manifestation]
One time ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “The next Manifestation will also appear
through Me.” From this utterance, it was understood that the next
Manifestation would be of the blessed descendants of the Center of the
divine Covenant and Testament, and none other.

Praise be unto God that in this mighty Dispensation nothing has
been left undisclosed. We must pray unto God to give sight to every
sightless one.

[Bahá’í Marriage Recognition in Iran]
For a while during the blessed days of the Guardian of the Cause of
God, the exalted government of Iran was most hostile towards the
Bayáníc135 marriages and considered them unofficial. This opposition

135Since the Bahá’í law of marriage in the Aqdas is derived from the Bayán, often the
early literature of the Faith referred to it as the Bayáníc marriage.

was such that after the marriage ceremony, the [Bahá’í] couple would be
imprisoned and punished.

During these upheavals, the beloved Guardian of the Cause of
God stated to this effect, “In Iran, marriage will become civil based. The
friends must persevere and establish firm foundations so they do not
participate in this instance.”

[Snake]
In Tiberius, one night near the morning, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá noticed that a
snake had crawled under His cushion. He instructed to this effect, “Put
him in a bag, take him to the field and release him. But do not slay him.”

This kindness of His blessed Self was <p.230> consistent with the
explicit text of His in which it is stated, “Unless ye must, bruise not the
serpent in the dust, how much less wound a man.”136

[Visiting the Shrine]
During the blessed period of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, on the days when the friends
of God attained and achieved visitation of the Shrines of Bahá’u’lláh or
the Exalted One [the Báb], for the sake of wafting pleasant fragrances,
His blessed Person would sprinkle each person with the essence of red
rose or pure perfume. And if for some reason He was not there and the
visitors [to the Shrine] were deprived of beholding the Countenance of
that beloved Beauty, then the custodian of that Threshold would carry
out this task and perfume everyone.

This practice and tradition was continued and maintained in the
same exact form during the blessed days of the Guardian of the Cause of
God.137

At the time of the arrival of the British government in Palestine
and the Holy Land, many of their soldiers were Indian, and a large
contingent of them set camp in the vicinity of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh.

136 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 256; the official
translation is not precise.
137 The present translator recalls the same practice continuing into mid 1970s by the

custodians of the Shrines.

Since they considered the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh a sacrosanct spot and a
site of visitation, they would go and enter the Shrine at the time of the
obligatory prayer, and to the extent they had time engaged in offering
their supplications and prayers.

Whenever ‘Abdu’l-Bahá went to visit [the Shrine], they would
attain His blessed presence and partake of that bounty.

Since the aforementioned Áqá Siyyid Abú’l-Qásim Khurásání was
somewhat familiar with the Hindi language, he would serve as a
translator for the blessed utterances [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. However, he
would excessively use Kertahi and Murtazi dialects. Therefore, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá said to him, “This is all Kertahi and Murtazi!” His own Person
recounted this story with much laughter and delight.

Bahjí 1918

At all events, one day He remarked to those soldiers, “Whatever is
your wish, ask it of this Sanctified Edifice and it will be granted.” After
hearing this utterance, immediately they performed their ablutions,
entered the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh and commenced their entreaties and
obligatory prayers.

After this event, only within two or three days, a telegraph with
the instruction for their discharge and return home was received. At that
time they would say with the utmost happiness and excitement, “Our
appeal to this Sanctified Edifice was this [returning home]. Praise be
unto God that He accepted our plea.”

[Dreams]
Once the aforementioned Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl had a dream in which he
had seen himself in Iran. He had inquired [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] about that
vision. He replied, “Do not forget this dream.”

At the time that the Guardian of the Cause of God sent him and
his kinfolks to Tehran, that exact vision came to pass.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “Whoever has a vision of the Prophets
and the chosen ones in a dream, that dream is true.”

[Benefits of Grapes]
One afternoon Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl Mansúr took some excellent grapes
from ‘Akká to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s blessed presence in Bahjí. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
replied, “Today My meal was heavy and I wanted some grapes.”
Therefore, He immediately partook of some.

> His blessed purpose was that grapes enhance digestion.

Regarding radishes, which in Arabic are called fujl, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
would say, “A fujl enhances digestion. However, a radish itself is hard to
digest.”

[Divine Laws]
One day the Guardian of the Cause of God was in the pilgrim house of
the Shrine of the Exalted One. That day was a day for general visitation,
and as such, a group of <p.235> the friends of God, both pilgrims and
resident believers, were in his presence. Among his blessed utterances to
that assemblage, words to this effect were included, “I have received a
letter from one of the friends in the West in which he has suggested that
I remove the law of fasting from the Book.” With a baffled look and

smiling, he added, “I wrote him that these are divine laws and
ordinances.”

His blessed purpose was that teachings and exhortations that have
been sent down from the heaven of the divine decree will remain and are
established until the end of eternity, and under no circumstances may a
word or a jot of it be changed or altered.

[A Contemporary Violator of the Covenant]
It may be that the questioner had asked about this matter [fasting] out of
simplicity, or perhaps he was a new Bahá’í, but in these days in which
God’s Universal House of Justice has been formed and established, and
the sovereignty and grandeur of the Cause of God has penetrated all
corners of the globe, and rank upon rank are entering with humility and
meekness beneath the Word of God, a foolish and unthinking person,
with evil and base intentions, has shamelessly attempted such a thing.138
That is, through his vain imaginings, false ideas, and evil, petrified and
empty thoughts, which all stem from passion and desires, he has
abrogated many of the laws and teachings of the Kitáb-i Aqdas –
revelations which are the spirit of this age, sufficient for the happiness of
humankind, and the savior of all that dwell on earth from every harm
and difficulty. In addition, his cohorts, whose pride and egotism are
combined with mindlessness and stem from irreligiosity and absence of
faith, have arisen to assist and aid that senseless polytheist.

This wayward and misguided person has opposed the explicit
divine texts, and under all conditions has raised complaints, criticism and
opposition based on his own desires and passions, much like the pivot of
rebellion [Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí] and the abased Covenant-breakers.
More or less, he is engaged in interpretation and elucidation, and day and
138This section appears to be a reference to Jamshíd Ma’ání, an Iranian Bahá’í, who
in the 1960s claimed to be a new Manifestation of God (despite Bahá’u’lláh’s
specific prohibition in the Kitáb-i Aqdas against such a claim before less than 1000
years passed). He gained some following, mainly in Iran, and later was expelled by
the Universal House of Justice. He formed an organization called, “The House of
Mankind” (which is also known as the “Faith of God”) and the “Universal Palace of
Order,” which now appear to be defunct, as announced by the Encyclopedia of
Religions: http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html

night, with great insistence and much audacity, employs every means to
divert simpletons from the straight path, and to bring them to imbibe
the poison of faithlessness.

It is evident that association with the ignorant and unwise, and
those unaware of the truth of the Cause and God’s inscrutable teachings,
with such evil and satanic individuals, will result in being sealed with the
mark of the violation of the Covenant, and becoming dispersed,
confused, dejected, humbled, ashamed before the community and also
by their family and loved ones, and in being cast afar and distanced.
Moreover, they will achieve the loss of both worlds and God’s
chastisement.

Moreover, with the utmost impudence, deceit and trickery, these
polytheists have written letters to various places so that others would be
diverted from the straight path of God, and join them in their shameful
and superfluous beliefs.

Even though they stand condemned at God’s door, and immersed
in misery and deprivation, they have not repented or atoned. They
consider the Cause of God to be a plaything of the foolish, and have
preferred fire to eternal life.

At the end, such people will become an example for all people to
avoid. Praise and glorification be unto God, for having completed, in
every manner, His proof unto the people of Bahá, and for having
established the exalted institution of the Hands of the Cause of God,
and through explicit, clear, evident text having enjoined upon all to turn
to the sublime threshold of God’s Universal House of Justice, may its
pillars be strengthened. <p.240>

[Pages 240-241 are missing in the copy of the manuscript available to the present
translator. It appears that in this section, the marriage of Shoghi Effendi and
Ruhiyyih Khánum is recounted. Translator.]

[The Marriage of Shoghi Effendi and Rúhiyyih Khánum]
… upon both be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, proceeded in an
automobile from the blessed House of Haifa to the Shrine of

Bahá’u’lláh. After their visitation and return, their marriage vows were
taken that very night in the chamber of the Greatest Holy Leaf – the
remnant of God and the trust of Bahá – who longed to witness such an
hour. The marriage readings were recited softly by his own blessed
temple [Shoghi Effendi] in the presence of those maidens of celestial
heaven and the parents of both sides.

After the conclusion [of the ceremony], he turned to that essence
of sanctity [Bahiyyih Khánum] and said words to this effect, “Khánum,
the marriage ceremony took place in your chamber.”

> In short, with utmost reverence and dignity it was concluded.

In the morning, when the friends of God learned and became
aware of this most mighty tidings and this joyous news, out of their
delight and exhilaration, they decided to hold a [marriage] celebration in
the blessed House. However, when this was mentioned to his blessed
presence, he stated, “The friends may do what they wish, but in their
own homes.”

In truth, a joy and elation enveloped everyone on that day that is
beyond any description, mention or exposition.

In beauty, splendor, perfection and dignity, Ruhiyyih Khánum was
like the Virgin Mary, and in truth, was a product of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
influence. This is because her illustrious parents – upon both rest the
mercy and paradise of God – made an appeal. His blessed will and
decree bestowed upon them this mighty bounty and precious trust [i.e.
Rúhiyyih Khánum]. How sweet it is that out of the kindness and
compassion of His Holiness, every aspect of this marriage took place.

[Gift from America]
After Rúhiyyih Khánum’s marriage, as a gift and a good omen, the
Bahá’ís of America presented and submitted a chest of luxurious and
expensive clothes, which typically were worn by the westerners. <p.245>
However, this was not acceptable unto her and she stated in effect,
“Such attire is not the clothing for this place” and in accordance with her
instructions, they were returned.139

From the original, it is not clear if it was Rúhiyyih Khánum or Shoghi Effendi

\[139\] 
who did not accept the gift of clothing and instructed that it be returned.

[A Gift for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
In the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, a container full of the finest prized
tableware was presented to Him. However, upon seeing it and before
they were removed from the container, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “These will
not be of benefit to us.” Therefore, in the same manner and condition as
they had been in the container, He bestowed them upon someone else.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá enjoyed a simple and uncomplicated life, even in
food and clothing.

My mother used to relate that the Blessed Beauty would say,
“Prepare only one dish, but make it in perfection.”

[Mírzá Mahmúd Zarqání]
The honored Mírzá Mahmúd Zarqání was a teacher of the Faith during
the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and readily stood to the service and
promotion of the Cause of God, and the diffusion of divine fragrance.
After the ascension [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], through the bounties and
benevolence of the Guardian of the Cause of God and in accordance
with the command [of Shoghi Effendi], he was engaged day and night in
writing and speaking [for the Faith] and, as before, continued to remain
in the utmost constancy and firmness.

One night, there was a gathering in the blessed House of Haifa.

Because of his many obligations, he [Zarqání] arrived a little late. The
Guardian of the Cause of God – may my spirit be a sacrifice unto his
kindness – said to him, “I give you too much work. I am embarrassed.”

In truth, this very remark, which was solely out of his benevolence
and munificence, would suffice Mírzá Mahmúd in both worlds.

After ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ascension, he composed a poem, which
included this repeated refrain:

O ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, glance over us,

Glance from that world above.

This poem greatly attracted the blessed attention of the Guardian
of the Cause of God and he would instruct, “Recite it.” Therefore,
collectively and in a heartrending tone, this poem would be recited [by
the friends].

After some time, when the Guardian of the Cause of God was
away [from Haifa], he journeyed from the Holy Land to Iran. However,
during his return, suddenly he became ill, passed away in Rasht, and
joined the Exalted Paradise.140

After the passing of that devoted servant of God, the beloved
Guardian of the Cause of God would speak about him, including the
remark, “The preciousness of Mírzá Mahmúd Zarqání’s services will
become evident in the future.”

[Mírzá Mahmúd Furúghí]
The honored Mírzá Mahmúd Furúghí was one of the teachers and
eminent believers of the Cause. He had [previously] been a cleric. He
was a native of Dughabad of Khurasan.141

One day in ‘Akká while offering his obligatory prayer, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá suddenly entered the room. He immediately turned his face
towards the brilliant visage of the Master. However, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to
him, “Mind your business!” That is, in the course of obligatory prayer,
one’s attention must remain solely, and without any deviation, on the
Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh which is point of adoration of the people of Bahá.

One day in the pilgrim house of the Shrine of the Exalted One,
while he was listening to the recitation of God’s verses, after hearing
some passages, from the attraction and enkindlement of the fire of
God’s love that burnt brightly in his soul, suddenly he removed his
turban and fiercely threw it to the ground.

140 Zarqání’s passing took place on 11 October 1927 and he is buried in Mudíriyyih
Cemetery.
141 For intriguing stories about him see, Afnán, In the Land of Refuge: The Genesis of the

Bahá’í Faith in Shiraz; (trans. Ahang Rabbani), and for a more complete biography
see, Bushrú’í, The Voice of the Heroes: The Genesis of the Bahá’í Faith in Khurasan, (trans.
Ahang Rabbani).

This intense condition, which stemmed from his indescribable
love and enthrallment, would occur from time to time, and would draw
and fascinate the attention of the listeners. However, later, in view of the
fact the beloved Guardian of the Cause of God had said to him,
“Remain in a calm state,” he changed his behavior and would maintain
his peace and composure.

[Condition of Confirmation]
<p.250> The Guardian of the Cause of God – may my spirit be a
sacrifice unto him – had dismissed one of the friends [who was resident
in the Holy Land] in favor of Egypt with the promise of success. After a
while, one of the believers of that region attained his blessed presence,
and that night a gathering was held in the blessed House of Haifa. In
that assembly, he reported in effect the following on the condition of
that person [sent to Egypt], “He stated, ‘The Guardian of the Cause of
God promised me confirmations, but I am not successful yet.’ I said to
him, ‘Success is conditioned upon and results from efforts and exertions
on the requirements.’”

The Guardian praised and approved this comment, and remarked,
“It is as you state.”

His purpose was that success comes from action in undertakings,
and comes from endeavoring and instigating.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, “Confirmations and success are
suspended betwixt earth and heaven. That is, only action is required for
it to be realized.”

[Provocation of the Opponents]
During the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in ‘Akká, the spiteful Covenant-
breakers, solely for the purpose of turmoil, division and harm upon the
temple of the Cause of God and achieving their own purpose, had given
some of the divine verses and Tablets of the Blessed Perfection to the
mutisarrif of that era. After studying [these documents], the mutisarrif
summoned ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the government-house so he could ascertain
His objective.

In the blessed House of ‘Akká, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá described this
incident and stated in effect, “The mutisarrif brought out those divine
verses and Tablets, and inquired of the truth of the matter. I realized that
it was no longer time for wisdom, so I sat him down and commenced
teaching him the Faith. The mutisarrif accepted and attained unto
certitude.”

Towards the end of his life, Siyyid Mihdí Dahají had also given
some of the verses of the Blessed Beauty to ‘Akká’s muftí.

In short, all the harms of their evil machinations returned to
themselves. They were all obliterated and expunged, and their existence
became nonexistent.

[Neutralizing the Enemies]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá – may the spirit of all sincere friends be a sacrifice unto His
footsteps – used to say to this effect, “When someone harms my Person,
I forgive him. However, when their harm impacts the Cause of God,
then I will not pardon.”

During the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, a person in Egypt was
the leader of a band of men, and would provoke these men against the
Bahá’ís of Egypt, and for this reason had brought about difficulties. One
day that same person arrived in Haifa from Egypt. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
summoned him. After the man entered into ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence, He
said to him, “You are causing injury to my community.” Then he was the
recipient of warnings, admonishments and several slaps.

After he left [the room], immediately he was summoned once
more. He thought to himself that perchance the page had turned [and
this time ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would be friendly to him], but it was not so since
upon his entrance, one more time, the same thing occurred and ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá picked up where He had left off.

When this man returned to Egypt, he gave unequivocal, emphatic
and decisive command to that band and emphasized, “You should not
show any malice towards this community [i.e. Bahá’ís], as no one can
defeat their Chief [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]; He is most powerful and able.”

It was then that the Bahá’ís of Egypt were freed from his mischief.

One time, He [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] stated, “With some people, a
thousand counsels and admonishments would not have the same effect
as a slap.”

At all events, in different forms and taking <p.255> different
shapes, many such occurrences would take place – so many that they
remain unnumbered and uncountable. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, while extremely
meek, was the zenith of power and grandeur.

[Chanting]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “If voice-recording had been available during
the days of the Blessed Beauty, I would have recorded His voice.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá was not pleased with the chanting of some Iranians
who, while reciting prayers, excessively extended [the final syllable]. This
was especially true of the chant of the divine verses and prayers since it
diminished the condition of spirituality and the effect of the prayer. He
would also say to this effect, “Some are consumed in their own singing
and this causes the effect [of God’s words] to be reduced.”

His point was that divine verses must be recited with the finest
voice.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá praised the chanting of the Qur’an in the Egyptian
dialect. Moreover, He would say, “If someone reads Arabic well, then I
allow him to recite verses of the Blessed Beauty in the gatherings of non-
Bahá’ís.” Sometimes this would occur and the listeners would be
thoroughly enchanted and enkindled.

[Colophon]
Presently, I conclude my memoirs at this point. With Bahá’í greetings,
this servant’s recollections and reminiscences were written in Tehran,
and concluded on the first day of ‘Ilm of the year one-hundred and
twenty-two Badí [corresponding to 16 October 1965].

Author’s Supplement

[The following supplemental materials appear after a page of comments by the Iranian
Bahá’í Publishing Committee (cited in the Translator’s Foreword). It appears that
after the Publishing Committee had expressed interest in publishing Shahídí’s
narrative and prepared the text for this purpose by editing it, it had decided to ask the
narrator to offer supplemental recollections and placed these additional materials at the
end.142 Translator.]

[Divine Confirmations]
During the time that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá resided and was established in ‘Akká,
one year it did not rain in that region. The inhabitants of that area
became deeply perturbed and distressed. For this reason, they
commenced prayers and supplications in mosques and other places of
worship. However, these entreaties remained unanswered [by God].

One day, a contingent of prominent non-Bahá’ís came into the
presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and expressed their considerable anxieties.
Among them was a man whose only daughter had recently died, and he
was passing his days with a heart filled with sorrow and grief. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá stated to that group words to this effect, “If this person was to
arise and offer obligatory prayers, in view of the fact that he is
brokenhearted, then God would accept his plea.”

After hearing this, he immediately rose, performed his ablutions
and in the presence of the entire congregation carried out the obligatory
prayer and supplications. At that moment, the weather changed, with
clouds filling the sky, and immediately rain began to pour.

This incident – like so many other similar occurrences that remain
unnumbered and untold – increased the wonder and astonishment of

142Further evidence that this section was a later addition include: (1) the page
numbers are different from the main document and only each sheet has been given
a sequential page number; and (2) there is no evidence that the Publishing
Committee edited this supplemental section.

those in attendance. It is because of this that it is revealed in the hadith
[Islamic traditions], “What we do comes from the will of God.”143

After the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá – may my spirit be a sacrifice
unto His remains – the child of one of the ladies, who was a follower of
His Holiness the Spirit [Jesus] and lived in Haifa, became severely ill to
the point that everyone had lost hope of his recovery and life.

One day, wailing, sobbing and crying, she came by the Shrine of
the Exalted One and with her fists began to repeatedly and loudly pound
on the door, shouting, begging and pleading, “O ‘Abbás Effendi, I
implore my son from Thee!” At the same time, she continued to cry
intensely, kissing and caressing that Edifice.

At last, in the same condition, she returned home. Upon arrival,
she saw her child was sitting in the bed and through God’s bounties and
benevolence had regained his health. In that instant, she raised her hands
heavenwards and thanked God that, sanctified be the Lord, her prayers
and supplications had found such ready and immediate acceptance at His
door of holiness.

[Avoidance of Tobacco]
One night ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was in the blessed House of ‘Akká and the
friends were in His blessed presence. In that gathering, a small quantity
of snuff reached His blessed nostrils, but with the utmost delicacy.144

143 The quoted hadith seems to be a corrupted form of a tradition cited by
Bahá’u’lláh (Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 112), “As to the Bayán, it consisteth in thy
recognition of God – glorified be He – as the One Who hath no equal, and in thy
adoration of Him, and in thy refusal to join partners with Him. As to the Ma‘ání,
We are its meaning, and its side, and its hand, and its tongue, and its cause, and its
command, and its knowledge, and its right. If We wish for something, it is God
Who wisheth it, and He desireth that which We desire.” Moreover, another hadith
of the same type is quoted in Muhammad-Báqi Majlisí, Biharu’l-Anwar, vol. 26, p. 14:
‫ ﻓﻨﺤﻦ ﻧﻔﻌﻞ‬، ‫ اﺧﺘﺮﻋﻨﺎ ﻣﻦ ﻧﻮر ذاﺗﻪ وﻓﻮض إﻟﻴﻨﺎ أﻣﻮر ﻋﺒﺎدﻩ‬، ‫وأﻣﺎ اﻟﻤﻌﺎﻧﻲ ﻓﻨﺤﻦ ﻣﻌﺎﻧﻴﻪ وﻣﻈﺎهﺮﻩ ﻓﻴﻜﻢ‬
‫ وإذا أردﻧﺎ أراد اﷲ‬، ‫ وﻧﺤﻦ إذا ﺷﺌﻨﺎ ﺷﺎء اﷲ‬، ‫( ﺑﺎذﻧﻪ ﻣﺎ ﻧﺸﺎء‬Omid Ghaemmaghami, Private
Communication, 1 January 2008.)
144 Snuff is a type of smokeless tobacco. There are several types used in different

ways. Traditionally Dry (or European) nasal snuff is inhaled, or snuffed, through the
nose and is a form of insufflation.

That is, like someone inhaling the fragrance of a flower – even more
delicate. He stated, “A small amount is beneficial. But too much will
cause dryness of the nose.”

However, this servant did not witness another occasion of such
use [by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá].

The point was that the snuff removes the vapor and heaviness of
the head, but it is conditioned on the use of a small amount. That is, it
should not be used in such a way as would cause addiction in a person.

Nevertheless, the principle intent of His blessed Person in so
doing was to emphasize the ill and loss due to this usage, so that the
friends of God would remain sanctified and pure from every direction.

[Morality versus Expediency]
During the blessed days of the Guardian of the Cause of God, one of
the Bahá’ís of Iran, whose job was in a governmental office and who was
thoroughly an expert in discharging his duties, wrote a missive [to Shoghi
Effendi] and therein described his situation and that of those wishing ill
upon the Cause of God.

The entire letter explained that the authorities in his department
were insisting that he should forego his religion and convictions, or at
least conceal and hide them, since they needed his person [for the
department to function]. However, they were seeing no results from
their insistence except disappointment. For this reason, they had read the
poem of Sa‘dí to him:

> “A well-intended lie is admitted to be preferable to a
> seditious truth.”145

145Sa‘dí (1213-1292) is nom de plume of Musharrifu’d-Dín ibn Muslihu’d-Dín. Born in
Shiraz, he is one of the greatest figures in classical Persian literature. The cited poem
comes from one of his best-known works, Gulistán (1258; The Rose Garden), which is
mainly in beautifully crafted prose and contains stories and personal anecdotes. The
text is interspersed with a variety of short, eloquent poems, containing aphorisms,
advice, and humorous reflections. The morals preached in the Gulistán border on
expediency.

That is, they implied, “Ascribe to whatever religion you wish, but
speak this lie out of expediency.”

In short, after the arrival of this missive, one day the beloved
Guardian of the Cause of God was at the pilgrim house of the Shrine of
the Exalted One [the Báb]. That day was a day of general visitation. That
supplication was in his blessed pocket. It was read in accordance with his
instructions and the friends of God heard its contents. After a short
pause, the Guardian stated, “They are resorting and clinging to the
corroded sayings of Sa‘dí.” He immediately rose and proceeded to the
Shrine of the Exalted One for visitation.146

From His statement it could be discerned that the very standard
and balance for humanity will be the heavenly utterances and divine
teachings, and nothing else, and will remain so forever, particularly as it
relates to matters pertaining to God and morality.

[Souls]
One night a gathering of the friends of God was assembled in the
blessed House of ‘Akká in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence. This bounty was
also bestowed on this servant. He was speaking regarding the soul of the
deceased, including words to this effect, “In consideration of the
attraction and connection that the soul has had with the body, for forty
days the soul visits that location and spot [of burial].”147

[Penmanship]
<p.260> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “Handwriting must be legible.”

His blessed purpose was that the prime importance is legibility of
writings. However, it is certain that if something is written with exquisite
penmanship, then it is the very perfection.

146 In 1985, ‘Alí Nakhjavání shared a description of the same incident with the
present translator. However, he recalled, “Shoghi Effendi stated, ‘With one verse,
Sa‘dí destroyed the moral foundation of the Iranian people.’”
147 A similar sentiment is expressed in the Persian Bayán, 5:12.

[Daily Livelihood]
One time, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke about daily livelihood. Included in His
utterances was the essence of the following: “If a person conducts
himself in accordance with God’s teachings, then he should never worry
about his daily bread, as somehow it will be made available to him.”

His purpose was that a person’s success in all matters – including
his daily bread, which is made available to every living thing – is
conditioned and dependent upon his obedience to the divine laws and
ordinances, and nothing else.

[Commemoration Periods]
It was inquired of the presence of the Guardian of the Cause, “By the
difference of how many days should the observances, commemorations
and festivals that occur before or after the memorial and solemn Days148
of the Cause be held?” He replied, “By a difference of ten days before
and after.”

His blessed purpose was that out of respect, at least ten days [of
separation] is required. In truth, it is a bounty for the people of Bahá that
he did not decree and fix more days than this.149

148 It appears that the Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh and the martyrdom of the Báb are
intended here; and it may include the commemoration of the passing of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá.
149 Shoghi Effendi’s comments regarding the date of Bahá’í Holy Days are further

explored in Appendix 5.

Bahá’u’lláh’s Lawh Istiqámat

[The narrator cited Bahá’u’lláh’s Lawh Istiqámat [Tablet of Constancy] in the text
and Mark Costine has graciously prepared a provisional translation. The original
text is found in La’álí Hikmat, vol. 1, pp. 113-14,
http://reference.bahai.org/fa/t/b/LH1/lh1-112.html ]

He is the Holy, the Most Glorious.

O ye servants of the Merciful One! We admonish you to observe
trustworthiness, truthfulness and faithfulness, and to manifest the fear of
God, the Mighty, the Wise. Verily, he who holdeth fast to the fear of
God is accounted among those who occupy this sublime station. Your
eyes have been solaced, O people of Bahá, by gazing upon My Realm of
glory, and blessed are your ears for they have been honored by
hearkening unto the Verses of God, the Lord of the worlds. Appreciate
ye the value of this exalted station. By My life! The treasuries of the
heavens and of the earth can never hope to match it.

Verily the glances of God’s loving-kindness are cast upon you. He
heareth what ye speak in your love for Him and seeth what ye encounter
in the path of the all-compelling Cause of the All-Wise. He truly
remembereth you from His habitation in the Most Great Prison,
inasmuch as your names are written and preserved in the Guarded
Tablet. Say: By God! Each and every thing is a messenger of joy unto
you at all times, did ye but know.

Ye must be constant, exceedingly constant, so that your feet shall
not slip in the Straight Path. Say: This is My mightiest commandment
and My greatest charge upon you and amidst you. Heed ye it, then set it
before your eyes, and God is a witness unto what I say. In My Tablet,
My Scroll, My Scriptures, My Treatises and My Books, I verily have
admonished My loved ones, who soar in My atmosphere and who drink
the wine of Mine utterance, to observe the most perfect constancy. To

this testify My pen, Mine ink, My finger, My hand, Mine arm, Mine ear,
Mine eye, My hairs, My limbs and My truth-telling tongue.

Time and again We have mentioned this weightiest of themes, so
much so that My most exalted Pen hath addressed Me while moving
between My fingers, saying “O Thou Who art wronged and imprisoned
and the Guardian of the hidden and the known! I see that the ocean of
Thine intent is turning towards this word which Thou hast made the
foundation of Thy most exalted words in the station of remembrance in
the realm of creation. The glory of Thy might beareth me witness! I am
perplexed by this, O King of eternity, and truly Thou art the All-
Knowing, the All-Informed. I beseech Thee to remove the veil from the
face of mine understanding and to enable me to recognize Thy purpose,
O Thou the Desire of the World. {Can it be possible that after the
dawning of the day-star of Thy Testament above the horizon of Thy
Most Great Tablet, the feet of any-one shall slip in Thy Straight Path?”

Unto this We answered: “O My most exalted Pen! It behooveth
Thee to occupy Thyself with that whereunto Thou hast been bidden by
God, the Exalted, the Great. Ask not of that which will consume Thy
heart and the hearts of the denizens of Paradise, who have circled round
My wondrous Cause. It behooveth Thee not to be acquainted with that
which We have veiled from Thee. Thy Lord is, verily, the Concealer, the
All-Knowing!}150 Turn thou thy most radiant face toward the Most
Sublime Vision and say, ‘O my God, the Most Merciful! Adorn the
heaven of utterance with the stars of constancy, trustworthiness,
truthfulness and faithfulness. Verily, potent art Thou to do what Thou
willest. There is no God but Thee, the Ruler, the Beneficent.’”

Bahá’u’lláh on the Next Manifestation

[Portion of a Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh in which He refers to the next Manifestation was
cited by the narrator. This Tablet can be found in ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Ishráq-Khávarí,
Má’idih Ásimání, vol. 4, pp. 92-94. The full Text is provided below for ease of
reference as a provisional translation. Translator.]

This very moment was I summoned before the Throne.151 He
[Bahá’u’lláh] inquired, “With what wast thou occupied?” I submitted, “I
was writing answers to the objections raised by the infernal temple.”152
Thus spoke the Tongue of God:

Write:

> “Hast thou not heard that My proof is My essence, My
> evidence, My person, and My argument is My
> Manifestation? While that which hath proceeded from My
> pen is a pathway leading unto My recognition, whereunto
> none shall attain save those who have detached themselves

151 Mírzá Áqá Ján was Bahá’u’lláh’s amanuensis. It is in his voice that the present
passage is revealed.
152 Haykal jahím, rendered as infernal temple, is most likely a reference to Mírzá Yahyá

Azal. It appears that Mírzá Áqá Ján was engaged in responding to objections raised
by Mírzá Yahyá in a letter sent to the Holy Land by one of the believers. From the
Tablet it may be inferred that the chief objection raised was that Mírzá Yahyá had
advanced his claim to leadership by revealing verses. It is with this specific claim
that Bahá’u’lláh is concerned here and sets out to refute.

> pathway leading unto My recognition, as a bounty from Our

> of Will, and allotted them as the proof unto all who are in
heaven and on earth.

Ere this Manifestation, Verses alone had been the

might. We do as We will, and ordain as We please.

For in this Manifestation, God – glorified be His

> protected him under the wing of His wondrous and
surpassing grace.153

So have We decreed on this night, and We decree as
We wish through a command on Our part. Powerful I am to

This sentence appears to be a reference to Mírzá Yahyá Azal, who was raised by

Bahá’u’lláh and then treated Him treacherously.

creation.

O My creatures! Show not pride towards Him before
> Whose Countenance the countenances of the company of
> the Supreme Concourse are arrayed, nor be of them that
> wax disdainful.’

Here end the words of God, the Peerless, the Wondrous, the
Unique.

Appendix 3

Bahá’u’lláh’s Utterance

[Under the section “The Next Manifestation,” Khalíl Shahídí cited a passage from a
Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh, which read in part: “For in this Manifestation, God –
glorified be His mention – hath willed that most of the believers and the sincere ones
should give utterance to Verses.” Perhaps as an exposition on this theme, the
following extract from Fádil Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 5, pp. 25-
26, is provided. Translator.]

Nabíl Zarandí has narrated some of the oral utterances of the Blessed
Beauty [Bahá’u’lláh], spoken in those days [in Edirne].

“While I was in the presence [of Bahá’u’lláh] with a number of others in
the house of ‘Izzat Áqá, I heard the Blessed Tongue speak these words:

> Since We were well-known among all the ministers of Iran,
> they would all exhibit friendship towards Us. However, they
> were afraid lest the government would issue a grave order
> against Us. Since the governor of Tehran had heard of the
> incident of Badasht that a group [of the Bábís] had been
> with Us, he took an oath, “Many times I have heard various
> accounts about Him [Bahá’u’lláh], but I have overlooked
> them. However, next time, of a certainty I will slay Him.”
> He ordered the khans [local chieftains] in Mazandaran to
> arrest and punish Us. However, his majesty the king
intervened.

Later on, the Amír-Nizám said in the assemblage of
> the nobles, “He [Bahá’u’lláh] has brought much harm upon
> the government. But, nevertheless, He resides in Tehran in
the utmost splendor.”

It was a perilous time. Many of the nobles were urging
Me to journey [away from Tehran] in a different direction.

> However, I considered all of these talks to be drivel, since
> God desired to manifest His Cause and it was not possible
> for any harm to come to Me until the Cause had been made
> manifest, or for the Almighty not to protect Me in midst of
calamities.

However, from another direction, in consideration of
> divine wisdom, We empowered the tongue of a few others
> to speak Wondrous Words so that people’s attention would
> be diverted elsewhere and before its appointed time, none
> would become aware of the Source. One of those people
> was the honored [Mírzá] Munír [Káshání], whose words
> were preferred over the words of Yahyá [Azal]. However, in
> publicizing the name Yahyá, and speaking about him in his
> absence, Our intention was for the people of the Bayán to
> focus their attention on the house wherein God’s Purpose
> was concealed. And the intention of His Holiness the
> Exalted One [the Báb] by proclaiming the naming of Azal
> was the same, but He styled him as one of the mirrors and
> He exalted the Letters of the Living – of whom Mullá Hasan
Bajistání was one – over the mirrors.

Moreover, He [the Báb] instructed the most
> renowned of the believers [Bahá’u’lláh] to educate Yahyá.
> For years, We busied Yahyá with writing the Words of God
> and the Verses of the Lord. He wrote them in Our presence
> and We encouraged him, and corrected whatever he wrote.
> He commenced writing from the age of twenty, but never
> were his writings without errors, both in the material and
spiritual meanings.

However, the honored Munír wrote Wondrous Words
> without having had the benefit of tuition from Us and
> without needing any corrections. If Yahyá had a jot of
> equity, he would consider the presence of Munír as a
> complete proof [of Our influence], since he saw that in both
> Baghdad and Edirne, Munír’s words were the essence of
> power, and composed without any pauses.

In view of the Will of His Holiness the Exalted One,
> it was binding upon Yahyá that should someone like him
> [Munir] appear in his days, then he should hand the Cause
> to him.

The Suicide of Abú’l-Hasan Afnán

[In the section “Mírzá Abu’l-Hasan Afnán”, the narrator recounted the story of the
Afnán who committed suicide on hearing ‘Abdu’l-Bahá foretell of His own passing in
a few days. The following materials expand on this poignant story. Transliteration of
names has been adjusted in conformity with the rest of this monograph. Translator.]

Document 1: Star of the West, vol. 12, Mulk 1, 77 (February 7, 1922) No.

letter from Ahmad Tabrízí to Dr. Zia Baghdadi.

> Haifa, Palestine, November 29, 1921
My dear brother:

I am grieved to announce to you in brief that the
> Master, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, has ascended to the Kingdom by his
> own will. In some of his writings and Tablets, which are not
yet made public, he clearly stated in regard to his departure.

Also in his talks to the friends, in the meetings and
> even to the strangers and visitors he made similar remarks.
Soon I will write you and send you the details.

His latest advices and admonitions to the friends are
to the effect that they must be in perfect unity and harmony.

He said: “There shall not be any separation among the
> believers because Bahá’u’lláh has appointed the House of
> Justice to be the authority. In the future, many false
> traditions and untrue statements will appear, but the men of
> the House of Justice will with great power stop the mouths

House of Justice.”

> the family of the Báb, for many years living near ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá) realizing the approach of the most great calamity the

> Master’s ascension could not wait to see it, and therefore he
drowned himself here, in the sea.

The Master, in advising us and all the friends, said:
“You must not injure yourselves or commit suicide.

“It is not permissible to do to yourselves what Mírzá
> Hasan Afnán did to himself. Should anyone at any time

quiet.

“In all my calamity and difficulties I used to say to

martyrdom in this path.

“Arise ye in service to the Cause of God as the
Apostles arose after the departure of Christ.”

The Master has left a will, which is His Covenant,
> written with his own blessed hand. As soon as it is read, I
> shall write to you what it contains. It is the hour of firmness

faithful to the Cause and loyal to the Covenant.

> Damascus, Syria,
My dear uncle:

Oh! what a calamity has befallen us by the departure
of our beloved Master.

Several times in meetings during the year, up to the
> time I left Haifa, he said: “I have completed my work and
> duties in this world and what is left will be done by the
> friends. I want to rest. The actions of the náqizín [the
> Covenant-breakers] and others so injure me that if my heart
> be pierced with a spear it will be much easier to bear than
> these actions. Suppressed sorrows will kill a man. If one
> should relate his sorrows to a friend the sorrow will be
> removed from his heart and he will be at ease; but if one
> shall keep it and does not speak it to others it will work in
> him, make him sick and kill him. You do not know what is
happening. I do not say anything.”

> Such words were uttered by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá many times.

A certain person was such a great stumbling block in
> the path of the Beloved that he said to Bahádur: “My soul
> has reached my lips because of his deeds” He continued: “I
> want to rest for six months. The doctor does not allow me
to work, read and write.”

To begin with, he dismissed Mírzá Azízu’lláh Bahádur
> and Ibn-Asdaq, the latter to stay in Shiraz under the care of
> Mírzá Báqir Khán; next he dismissed Shaykh Muhammad-
> ‘Alí, his son and Siyyid Mustafa of Rangoon. A little later, he
> dismissed Jinab Fadil [Mázandarání] and Subhí, the latter
> was told that when his services would be needed he would
> be called meantime to go and teach in Persia. Not a pilgrim
was left in Haifa.

On Friday night, November 18th, the Beloved had a
> cold. That morning Mírzá Abu’l-Hasan Afnán dismissed his
> servant and said he was going away. He wrote a supplication
> to the Beloved. Then the Afnán went to the seashore, about
> two hours walk, and threw himself into the sea. Some
> fisherman nearby took him out and notified the authorities.

> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent his automobile. I went with the Afnáns
> and Dr. Lutfu’lláh [Hakím] and helped to bring his body
> home. The next day when we carried the body from his
> house, the Beloved approached and assisted in carrying the
> casket to the carriage. I am sure the Master told him about
> His departure from this world and that because of it he
> threw himself into the sea. Another incident: Ten days
> before this a Bahá’í Turk named Dr. Suleiman Rifaat Bey,
> whose home is in Beirut, came to visit ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The
> day after his arrival a telegram came stating his brother had
> died. The shock overcame him. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá opened the
> windows, washed the face and head, rubbed the chest of the
> doctor, gave him some water mixed with spices, patted him
> on the back, embraced him, and consoled him. During this
> talk the Beloved said: “Don’t be sorry. My departure from
> this world is very near.” (Dr. Bey did not mention this until
> after the departure of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, not quite a fortnight
> later. The next morning the Master sent him to Beirut with
Ahmed Bey Yazdí and Monever Khanum.

On the morning of November 26th, I left for
> Damascus. I arrived that night and communicated the news
> of the good health of the Master to the friends and my
> father. On Sunday, at a meeting, we spoke of it. Monday
> noon a telegram came saying the Beloved had departed from
this world.

I heard that on Sunday, the 27th, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sat in
> the garden under the apricot tree. He called Ismá‘íl Áqá and
> asked for some fruit tangerines, sweet lemons and oranges.
> He ate some and distributed the others among the friends

> he awoke, called the Greatest Holy Leaf, said good bye to all
> and at 1:30 a. m. ascended to the Kingdom of Abhá.
> Immediately, everybody was notified and the weeping and

A few days after the ascension, a Muslim said to one

surely gloated over the ascension of our Beloved.

Muhammad-‘Alí came to the house of mourning.

Bahá’í Holy Days

In the section “Commemoration Periods”, the Guardian’s comments
about the observance of Bahá’í Holy Days were recorded by the
narrator. While the details of the Bahá’í calendar system will be legislated
by the Universal House of Justice in due time, the following research
note is offered as an exploration of this subject.

The Bahá’í Holy Days consist of 9 days (given below in no
particular order):

> 1.   Birth of Bahá’u’lláh
> 2.   Birth of the Báb
> 3.   First day of Ridván
> 4.   Ninth day of Ridván
> 5.   Twelfth day of Ridván
> 6.   Declaration of the Báb
> 7.   Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh
> 8.   Martyrdom of the Báb
> 9.   Naw-Rúz

In determining the date of observance of these Holy Days, we are
aided by the following Tablet by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá addressed to Áqá Shaykh
Muhsin in Hamadan:155

> Regarding observances [of Holy Days] in this mighty
> Dispensation, some are by the solar and others by the lunar
calendar.

The Ridván festivity, the Naw-Rúz celebration and the
> night of Ascension [of Bahá’u’lláh] are observed according
> to the solar calendar.

155   Ishráq-Khávarí, Ganjínih Hudúd va Ahkám, p. 426.

However, in accordance with an explicit text, the twin
> blessed Birthdays [of Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb] are observed
> consecutively, and this cannot be except by their observance
in accordance to lunar reckoning.156

During the blessed days [of Bahá’u’lláh], the
> declaration of His Holiness the Exalted One – may My spirit
> be a sacrifice unto Him – and the martyrdom of His
> Holiness the Primal Point were observed in accordance with
> lunar calculations. However, this has not been explicitly
> stated in the Kitáb-i Aqdas.

Therefore, according to this explicit exposition by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
the date of 7 (out of 9) Holy Days are fixed. That is, it can be concluded
that Ridván (3 Holy Days), Naw-Rúz and the Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh
are by solar calendar, while the twin Births are to be observed based on
lunar calculations.

Of the remaining two Holy Days, namely, the Declaration and the
Martyrdom of the Báb, the observance of one of them has been clarified
by the following statement of Bahá’u’lláh:

> 36. QUESTION: If the anniversary either of the Twin
> Birthdays or of the Declaration of the Báb occurreth during
> the Fast, what is to be done?
> ANSWER: Should the feasts celebrating the Twin Birthdays
> or the Declaration of the Báb fall within the month of
> fasting, the command to fast shall not apply on that day.157

156 The explicit text referred to by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá appears to be the following
statement in Questions and Answers (Bahá’u’lláh, The Kitáb-i Aqdas, p. 105):

> 2. QUESTION: Concerning the Festival of the Twin Birthdays.
> ANSWER: The Birth of the Abhá Beauty was at the hour of dawn on
> the second day of the month of Muharram, the first day of which
> marketh the Birth of His Herald. These two days are accounted as
> one in the sight of God.

157 Bahá’u’lláh, The Kitáb-i Aqdas, p. 118.

From the above statement, it is clear that the only reason why the
Declaration of the Báb would coincide with the fast season would be for
it to be observed on a lunar basis.

That leaves only the Martyrdom of the Báb. There are reasons to
believe that this Holy Day is to be observed according to solar
reckoning. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in a Tablet to Mírzá Qábil Ábádih’í states the
following:158

> You had written about the Day of Declaration of His
> Holiness the Exalted One – may My soul be a sacrifice unto
> Him, which is mentioned in Questions and Answers. This
> occurred on the day of kamál of the month of ‘Azamat,159
> and the day of Martyrdom took place on the day of sultan of
> the month of Rahmat.160 This is an explicit text and nothing
> may conflict with explicit texts. Later it will be followed as
such.

However, during the blessed days [of Bahá’u’lláh],
> these two sacred days were observed on the fifth of
> Jamádu’l-Avval and the twenty-eighth of Sha‘bán, and the
> friends used to gather in the Hallowed Presence [of
> Bahá’u’lláh]. On the Day of Declaration, He would express
> His joy, and on the Day of Martyrdom would express
> sadness, to the point that a profound effect was evident on
> His sanctified Countenance. Therefore, we also observe
those two occasions on the same dates.

However, what has been written explicitly will take
place in the future …161

Regarding the twin Birthdates, the explicit text states
that they occur on the first and the second of Muharram.

158 Ishráq-Khávarí, Ganjínih Hudúd va Ahkám, pp. 426-427.
159 ‘Azamat [Grandeur] is the fourth Bahá’í month and starts on 17 May. Kamál is
the eighth day of the month. Therefore, the reference here is to 24 May.
160 Rahmat [Mercy] is the sixth Bahá’í month and starts on 24 June. Sultán is the

seventeenth day of the month. Therefore, the reference here is to 10 July.

If the above analysis is correct, then the following summary could
be concluded:

> Birth of Bahá’u’lláh                             Lunar
> Birth of the Báb                                 Lunar
> First day of Ridván                              Solar
> Ninth day of Ridván                              Solar
> Twelfth day of Ridván                            Solar
> Declaration of the Báb                           Solar162
> Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh                         Solar
> Martyrdom of the Báb                             Solar
> Naw-Rúz                                          Solar

Inasmuch as this analysis concludes that both the Martyrdom of
the Báb and the Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh will be observed by the solar
reckoning (and these are the only two solemn Holy Days), and three
joyous occasions, namely the Births of the Twin Manifestations and the
Declaration of the Báb, are observed on lunar basis and move
throughout the year, then it appears that the question put to Shoghi
Effendi (as reported in the section “Commemoration Periods”) requires
further legislations by the House of Justice. That is, it appears that
Shoghi Effendi did not wish for the solemn Holy Days to come within
10 days of joyous Days, but how this is to be reconciled and reflected in
actual Bahá’í calendar remains a matter for the House of Justice’s
consideration.

162 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement that the Declaration of the Báb will be observed in the
future on solar basis appears to contradict Bahá’u’lláh’s injunction in Questions and
Answers. However, the system of Bahá’í interpretative law requires that all
differences between Bahá’u’lláh’s and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statements be settled in favor
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, as the authorized interpreter of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá on Persepolis

[A summary of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s remarks about Persepolis (in Persian commonly
referred to as Takht Jamshíd), was given by the narrator in the text. This appears to
be a summation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s talk given on Sunday, 18 July 1915. Two
versions of this talk are known to the present translator: (1) Mírzá Badí‘ Bushrú’í,
Nuzdah Sál Shádmání, manuscript in private hands, pp. 92-94,163 and (2)
‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Ishráq-Khávarí, Rahiq Makhtúm, vol. 2, pp. 499-502. Without
citing its source, Rahiq Makhtúm appears to be quoting the eyewitness account of
Bushrú’í, which is used as the source text for the present rendering.

Persepolis was an ancient ceremonial capital of the Persian Empire. It was
built during the reign of Cyrus the Great around 560 BC. This vast and majestic
complex is situated some 70 km northeast of Shiraz. To ancient Iranians, the city
was known as Parsa, meaning The City of Persians, Persepolis being the Greek
interpretation of the name Pars.

Bushrú’í explains that in the morning, one of the German residents of Haifa,
Dr. Finkelstein, attained the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Afterwards, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
went to the pilgrim house and someone remarked, “Most of the homes in the upper
section have their doors shut.” The text below is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s response.
Translator.]
163 The present translator is grateful to Adel Shafipour for pointing out this
reference.

If someone goes to Takht Jamshíd [Persepolis], he will see how homes
are shut. There is no building that has not been destroyed. As expansive
as it was, Takht Jamshíd was destroyed and made into ruins. In
comparison, these present buildings are nothing.

When they say that Jamshíd raised this edifice [Persepolis], it is
frivolous talk. Takht Jamshíd was built by Gushtásb,164 Isfandiyár,165 and
Dará. This edifice was raised by them. However, its details are very
involved; few structures are found with such grandeur.

This edifice was located on the skirts of a mountain and had
several levels. A barrier was built in front of it ten meters high.

164   King Vishtaspa was the first Zoroastrian monarch of Iran.
165   Spendodata succeeded his father, King Vishtaspa.

Two sets of stairs flung out on each side: one on the right, and one
on the left. Each of these stairways were sixty feet [long]. However, they
were most amazing. Each step was a chárak wide and a girih high.166
When one reached the top of the stairs, one turned to the right, which is
sixty feet long, and then left, which is another fifty feet, for a total of one
hundred and ten feet. Similarly with the stairs on the left: sixty feet to the
left and fifty feet to the right. These stairs were built in such a way that a
person’s feet would not bend. With utmost ease, horses could go up and
down these steps.

When one reached the top [of these stairs], a platform appeared
that was 470 meters long and 290 meters wide. It is an expansive
platform. At the end of this platform, Gushtasb built an entrance that
had four pillars. On these pillars were [the statues of] four beasts: their
body was the body of a bull, and their head like the head of a man. They
had wings. Behind these statues, the platform sloped high for nine
meters. This corridor led to the royal hall that had forty pillars. This
building was initiated by Gushtasb and completed by Isfandiyar. In a
similar manner, the steps are short in height.

When you reached the top, there was the forty-pillar building. The
pillars were wide and tall. However, they were not made of a single
stone; rather, they were in three parts. Nevertheless, they were so well
fused that they appeared seamless.
166 A chárak is equivalent to one-fourth of a dar‘, which in turn is about one meter. A
girih is one-fourth of a chárak, or about one-sixteenth of a meter.

After this forty-pillar building, one reached the building raised by
Dará. It had many halls. For instance, its entrance gate was made of
three stones and two main pillars. The walls were made of such stones
that even today they shine like a mirror. They were so refined that one
could see oneself in them.

But, alas, it was destroyed. Most of the pillars have fallen. Of the
forty pillars, only thirteen remain standing. Besides this forty-pillar hall,
there was another building with one hundred pillars – most expansive.

When a person passed this [building] and ascended the short
mountain, at the top there was a dakhmih,167 which in its outer structure
was made with pillars. After this portico, there was a dakhmih where the
dead were placed. On the walls of this building, they have carved faces.
They have made statues [from the stones] of the mountain itself.

167Dakhmih was a circular building where the Zoroastrians laid the bodies of their
dead.

In the Gushtasb building, many pictures have been engraved on
either side of the stairs. The stones in the Gushtasb structure were each
two meters wide and of the same length. Many faces have been carved
on the walls: the faces of kings and soldiers, with some holding shields
and others spears. Also faces of farmers, artisans and shopkeepers.

On the walls, they have written in cuneiform, which was read by a
German. He traveled in Iran for many years and worked hard until
eventually he was able to decipher them. At first, he was unable to read
them, but found a piece of paper in Greece, which gave a translation of
cuneiform into the Pahlavi language beneath each word. By comparing
the letters, he was able to read the cuneiform inscriptions, since
cuneiform, the Pahlavi and Zand [languages] stem from the same Aryan
root. That is, they are from the same branch [of languages] and were
close to one another. Therefore, aided by this [decoding] paper, the
German was able to decipher the cuneiform in Takht Jamshíd.

In short, in cuneiform they have written who constructed this
building. People say that it was Jamshíd who built this structure, but this
is not true. Jamshíd lived five thousand years ago.

One of these pillars was brought to Paris and displayed in a
museum. At the top of the pillar were two bull heads, upon which the
building was built.

In truth, what amazing monuments Iran had! What a civilization it
possessed!

The Persian nations have written on these stones, “I am Darius,
the king of kings. By the favor of Ahura Mazda,168 I have raised this

168Ahura Mazda is the Avestan language name for a divinity exalted by Zoroaster as
the one uncreated Creator, hence God.

building. I have conquered the nations of Iran, Egypt, Greece, and
India” – and other nations that he named.169

Now Iranians in this age have brought down their nation from the
height of such grandeur to this misery and ruin, and are still conspiring
in the destruction of their nation. In truth, what ignorance can do!

I cherish the hope that Iran will become even mightier than her
past and that they would build a magnificent Mashriqu’l-Adhkar in Takht
Jamshíd. May Takht Jamshíd be developed even better than before and
be built in its original design and a Mashriqu’l-Adhkar be raised there
too. However, this must be done on the same foundation, and built in

169   Part of the inscription shown on this page reads:

> I am Darius the great king, the king of kings, the king of many
> countries, the son of Hystaspes, an Achaemenid.
> By the favor of Ahuramazda these are the countries which I got into
> my possession along with this Persian people, which felt fear of me
> and bore me tribute : Elam, Media, Babylonia, Arabia, Assyria, Egypt,
> Armenia, Cappadocia, Lydia, the Greeks who are of the mainland and
> those who are by the sea, and countries which are across the sea,
> Sagartia, Parthia, Drangiana, Aria, Bactria, Sogdia, Chorasmia,
> Sattagydia, Arachosia, Hinduš, Gandara, Sacae, Maka.

the exact form it had in the ancient days. This must be completed. In
addition, a Mashriqu’l-Adhkar must be instituted. …170

170The remainder of this talk is unrelated to Persepolis and as such has been left
untranslated in the present monograph.

> Zaynab and Khalíl Shahídí
> 2 A Lifetime With ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

Translator’s Foreword

One of the distinguishing features of the Bábí and Bahá’í religions is the
existence of a large number of eyewitness accounts and primary source
materials that closely document the founding and development of the
movements in their formative period, 1844-1921. Of this era, the largest
number of historical documents pertains to the ministry of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s. Indeed, beyond thousands of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s own
communications that present enormous details about the people and
early history of the Faith, thousands of pages of other eyewitness
documents closely chronicle vast portions of His activities and words,
and of those around Him – leaving a precious reservoir of information
for generations of historians to study, analyze and correlate, and for the
faithful to emulate.

The present narrative is one such document. In exceptionally
simple but direct and sincere language, the narrator recalls many
episodes of his interactions, spanning over four decades, with ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, Shoghi Effendi or Bahá’í residents of the environs of ‘Akká-Haifa.
Khalíl Shahídí makes it clear that he did not set out to write a detailed
history of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s august Personage or His ministry for a
worldwide audience.

His objective was much more personal and immediate. At the
insistence of family members, Shahídí was moved to share stories and
recollections of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi that had been
inscribed on his heart, and through them to encourage, inspire and even
edify his kinsmen or anyone else that would come upon his narrative.

The stories are simple. Their common denominators are the
wisdom of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, firmness in the Cause and obedience to the
Head of the Faith – for in these, Shahídí believed, lies one’s salvation.

If one had to identify an overarching theme in this narrative, surely
it would be constancy in Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant, since it is this subject,
perhaps mentioned more frequently and with greater emotional
investment than any other, which the narrator returns to time and again.
This theme appears to be his life biography, for Shahídí was born in
‘Akká in 1894 and his formative years corresponded with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
Khalíl Shahídí 3

ministry when opposition to His leadership was unabated. Shahídí
observed – indeed experienced firsthand – the relentless attack of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s faithless brothers, other family members and their
cohorts, and the turbulent period of the first four decades of the
Twentieth Century in the Holy Land. As a trusted resident believer of
‘Akká and a longtime custodian of the House of ‘Abbúd, he was at a
unique vantage point to observe ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as He dealt, neutralized
and triumphed over all opposition and adversaries.

The stories told are unadorned and unencumbered with historical
details, such as, dates, locations, participants and such. Shahídí explains:

> It should be clear to the esteemed readers that these
> recollections are composed without any preliminaries or
> conclusions, or citing specific dates. This is because the
> passage of time and days has robbed this servant of that
> ability. However, the events recorded, or those that are
> recounted, are mentioned without any addition or loss. Due
> to the passage of time, I may have forgotten some small
> details of certain incidents and, therefore, have not recorded
> those events [in this narrative], nor will they appear in the
> subsequent pages.

A careful reader will observe that these stories fill many details
about various aspects of occurrences in the early years of the Faith.
However, more importantly, they provide us with a window into the life
and days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá which is personal, direct and unfiltered.
History, in its authentic form, is based on such raw materials.

A Short Biography
Shahídí’s family background can be traced to the early days of the Bábí
Faith in Qum. It was there that his grandfather, Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl, had
embraced the Báb’s movement and led his brother, Áqá Husayn, to the
reform movement in their native town. Not long after that, misfortune
fell upon them and they were seized by the forces of orthodoxy. They
were taken to Tehran and imprisoned. Their hardships in the dungeon
4 A Lifetime With ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

were so severe that after two years, Áqá Husayn passed away. However,
Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl endured his great sufferings for seven years of
incarceration. At last when he was released, he went to Baghdad around
1862, where he attained the presence of Bahá’u’lláh and was won over.

He remained in Baghdad and served Bahá’u’lláh’s House – one of
the two sites of the Bahá’í hajj [obligatory pilgrimage] – as a waterman,
by carrying water in sheepskin from the nearby river to the House.1 For
five years, he performed this duty and many others with exemplary
faithfulness and dedication.

About 1867, Mírzá Buzurg Khán, the Iranian Consul in Istanbul,
assisted by Shaykh ‘Abdu’l-Husayn ‘Iráqí, a Muslim cleric and an
inveterate enemy of Bahá’u’lláh since His days in Baghdad, stirred up
mischief and brought about a wave of persecutions against the Bahá’ís of
that town.

One morning, as Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl was by the riverside carrying a
sheepskin of water to the House of Bahá’u’lláh, two men approached, set
upon him and with daggers tore open his bowels. He staggered on,
clinging with one hand to his load of water, holding back with the other
his entrails, until he reached the house. Then he collapsed and expired.2

Later a crowd of people gathered at the Muslim cemetery to
prevent his burial there. Eventually the authorities intervened, and he
was buried by their order.

1 Since there was no running water in the homes, there were men whose occupation
it was to carry skins full of water for household use and sometimes gardening.
2 This incident is referred to by Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p. 178. It should be

noted that no person from a Shi‘i background could read this story without being
reminded of the events of Karbala. The party of the Imam Husayn was deliberately
cut off from the river and was dying of thirst. The half-brother of the Imam
Husayn, ‘Abbás, volunteered to try to get to the water and bring some back. He was
attacked by the Umayyad forces and literally hacked to pieces with their swords as
he desperately made his way back to the encampment carrying water. He died trying
to get the water to them. All this is commemorated yearly in the Muharram rituals
and forms an important part of the sequence of events that are the Karbala mythos.
Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasul was also getting water from the river and was carrying it back
when he was attacked and cut with a sword and he died in his attempt to bring
water. And this occurred only about 50 miles from the site of the Karbala events.
(Moojan Momen, posting 24 February 2008 on Tarikh discussion group.)
Khalíl Shahídí 5

Áqá Husayn Áshchí gives a graphic and moving account of the
day when the letter conveying the news of the martyrdom of Áqá
‘Abdu’r-Rasúl reached Bahá’u’lláh. Those who were present and heard
Bahá’u’lláh read the account wept unrestrainedly.3 Bahá’u’lláh assured
them that they were lamenting the cruel death of Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl, but
he had attained what he had always desired - the station of martyrdom.

In some of His Tablets, Bahá’u’lláh has mentioned ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl,
recounted his sufferings and remembered him with much tenderness and
affection as shahíd [witnessed or martyred].

Bahá’u’lláh also revealed a Tablet of Visitation for Áqá ‘Abdu’r-
Rasúl Shahíd and showered His bounties upon his soul:

> O Rasúl! He Who is the King of Existence and the Lord of
> Hosts doth make mention of thee from this all-glorious
> Abode. We, verily, shall inform thee of that Rasúl who
> soared in Mine atmosphere; spoke forth My praise amongst
> My servants; and was so transported by the living waters of
> Mine utterance that he laid down his life in My path. Thus
admonisheth thee He with Whom is the Guarded Book.

O My most exalted Pen! Make mention of My servant

Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl had two sons:

1. Áqá Muhammad-Hasan Mansúr, who accompanied Bahá’u’lláh as

> a youth to ‘Akká. A deeply learned man and an exceptionally
> devoted Bahá’í, he never married and served most of his adult life

2. Abú’l-Qásim was a coppersmith, and married Dhikriyyih, who is

a. Jamílih was born during Bahá’u’lláh’s time, and her name

was bestowed by Him. She passed away at an early age.
b. Jamíl was born in Bahá’u’lláh’s days also, and named by

Him. He, too, appears to have passed away at a young age.

Shahídí’s Reminiscences
In 1965, Badí‘ Mansúr, a nephew of the narrator, was asked to devote
some time taking dictations as Shahídí spoke his recollections.6 It
appears that this was not only requested by the family, but also eagerly
encouraged by Iran’s Bahá’í Publishing Committee, which then took
steps to prepare the manuscript for publication. The Committee
appointed an editor (typically a learned member of its body) to edit and

5 ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl had a brother, ‘Abdu’s-Samad, who was a carpenter and lived in
Jaffa. When the family of Bahá’u’lláh left the Mansion in disrepair, Shoghi Effendi
asked ‘Abdu’s-Samad to undertake the necessary remodeling. ‘Abdu’s-Samad had a
son, Mansúr, who is remembered as having lived in a house east of the Pilgrim
House by the Shrine of the Báb. (Hossein Achtchi, posting on Tarikh discussion
group, December 2007.)

8 A Lifetime With ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

extract those passages suitable for immediate publication. The Persian
original text seems to have been lightly edited and sections identified
towards this objective. The editor notes (appended as page 257 of
narrative):

> The lines that have been drawn through these memoirs for
> division and correction were done so by Lajnih Mujaljalih
> Nashr Nafahat [The Committee for Diffusion of Divine
> Fragrances] and for this reason, this servant thought best
that it remain intact, and a clean copy was not reproduced.

> This was written for [the reader’s] information.

[Signature unreadable]

It appears that the intense publication schedule of the Committee
in the late 1960s and early ‘70s, and then the Islamic Revolution in Iran,
interrupted plans for publication of this document. Surprisingly, though,
it appears that this singularly important document remained unavailable
to the three scholars who published in early 1970s extensive studies on
the life and times of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, namely, the Hand of the Cause of
God Hasan Balyuzi, Muhammad-‘Alí Fayzí and Houshang Mahmudi,
nor to the translator’s knowledge was it used by any other author .

A close read of the Persian text makes it clear that the narrative is
simple spoken words. That is, no attempt was made to systematize the
presentation or use elevated language typically used in the Persian
literature of the Faith. Further, it is clear that the author, while
comfortable with spoken Persian, was not schooled in that language.
Given that Shahídí was born and raised in ‘Akká, it is perfectly
understandable that his “mother tongue” would have been Arabic. This
point is mentioned because the original Persian is not particularly
eloquent, though remarkably sincere. One finds many examples of this
throughout the narrative.

Since the account is a primary source document, every effort was
made to translate it precisely in the style and manner of the original, in
hope that by so doing it would convey a flavor of the original text. This
produced a certain inelegance in the translation, that for the sake of
authenticity and faithfulness to the original were overlooked. For

Khalíl Shahídí 9

instance, the narrator always refers to Shoghi Effendi as “The Guardian
of the Cause of God,” without any variation on this title, or Bahíyyih
Khánum is often referred to as “the Liege Lady of the people of Bahá.”
These titles have been kept. Also, kept were such titles for Bahá’u’lláh as,
“the Blessed Beauty”, “Supreme Pen”, and the like; or “the Exalted
One” for the Báb.

However, since this document is principally about ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
for the sake of clarity most of titles used for Him were replaced with
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Among the titles used by the narrator one often finds
Mawla al-Wará’, which means the Lord of Mankind.7 This too was
replaced with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

The page numbers of the original manuscript are indicated in
pointed brackets, such as <p.10>, every five pages.

Footnotes have been added to augment information, clarify
obscure points, and provide a more detailed perspective. Occasionally,
comments by the translator have been added to improve the clarity or
continuity of the material. These comments are enclosed in square
brackets, thus […]. All comments within parentheses are by the author,
Khalíl Shahídí.

The system of transliteration used in this monograph is consistent
with the method used in other academic publications and varies from the
system used in most Bahá’í publications by: (1) avoiding subdots and
underlines (e.g., Fádil), and (2) dropping the izafih connecting the first
name to the surname (e.g., Khalíl Shahídí, instead of Khalíl-i-Shahídí).

Since any single Islamic year (denoted AH) typically overlaps with
two Christian years, where only the Islamic year of the event is known,
the equivalent Gregorian date is given as the first of the two years
partially covered by that Islamic year.
7This title appears in many early Persian publications on the life of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
but with far less frequency at the present. The title is not Qur’anic, but it is found in
many Shi‘i hadith, where one finds it used as a title of both Imam ‘Alí and the
Twelfth Imam. In the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, beginning perhaps with the Kitáb-i
Aqdas, the designation finds life again, but with a new meaning as an appellation of
God (i.e. His Manifestation). At some later point, perhaps starting with Shoghi
Effendi, it appears that it was adopted as a title of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and for a while
other Persian writers seem to have followed suit. (Omid Ghaemmaghami, posting
on Tarikh discussion list, December 2007.)

Typically, the original text refers to the Central Figures by such
honorific titles as “His Holiness” or “His blessed Person,” and these
honorifics have been omitted in some instances. Nor does the
translation reproduce such expressions commonly used in the Iranian
literature of the Bahá’í Faith as, “May my life be a sacrifice unto His
Sacred Threshold.”

By the time Shahídí give expression to his memoirs, many
principal personalities featured in this history had died, and the original
text therefore often refers to them as “the late” or “the deceased.” These
terms, too, have largely been omitted.

It should be emphasized that the spoken words attributed to the
Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in these pages cannot be assigned
scriptural authority or equated with their authorized Writings. No one
took notes at the time those words were uttered, although it cannot be
ruled out that some may indeed be the very words spoken.

All renderings of the Sacred Writings from Persian and Arabic,
unless otherwise specified, are by the present translator. If an authorized
source (such as Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh) is not cited, then the renderings
should be considered as falling in the class of provisional translations
intended to convey the essence (mazmún) of communications by the
Founders of the Bábí and Bahá’í Faiths. Such summary renderings are
not to be confused with full authorized translations of the Bahá’í Holy
Texts, which will be disseminated in due time by the Bahá’í World
Centre.

Narrator’s Preamble

My kinsmen and friends have urged this servant to commit for posterity
as a memento such recollections as have remained with me from the
blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá – the Most Mighty Branch of God and the
Mystery of the Lord, the Compassionate – and the beloved and chosen
Guardian of the Cause of God, may my spirit be a sacrifice unto their
station. However, it was observed that all important occurrences that
transpired during these two sacred ministries have been recorded most
befittingly and completely, with eloquence and clarity, in the history of
the Cause. Therefore, it was decided not to write about such episodes,
particularly since innumerable scrolls and Tablets revealed from the
heaven of the will and decree of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Center of divine
Covenant and Testament, and the Guardian of the Cause of God, the
sacred essence of divinity, nothing has been left undisclosed. Indeed,
even the most minute details and occurrences have been revealed and
stand clear and manifest to everyone.

Consequently, I will write of such events that outwardly are very
simple, but in their own allotted sphere contain important insights, as
they have not been recorded elsewhere, although a portion of these
memoirs pertains to this servant and his relatives.
I beseech the prayers of the esteemed readers.

Reminiscences of

[Birth and Family Heritage]
The birth of this servant took place two years after the ascension of the
Blessed Perfection and Beauty – exalted and supreme is His
remembrance – and occurred in the city of ‘Akká.8 The beloved
Guardian of the Cause of God, with no resemblance [to me], was six
months younger than this servant and my mother was a milk-nurse for
him.9 It was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Who named this servant Khalíl, and after a
while Khalílu’lláh streamed from His blessed tongue.

On my father’s side, this servant is a grandson of Áqá ‘Abdu’r-
Rasúl Shahíd [martyr], who was martyred in Baghdad. His martyrdom is
described in the history books of the Cause. For this reason, our family
name became Shahídí.

My paternal uncle was Áqá Muhammad-Hasan, who was the
custodian of [‘Akká’s] pilgrim house.

My father was Áqá Abú’l-Qásim, who was a coppersmith and
most accomplished in this craft. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá often called him Ustád
Abú’l-Qásim, and consequently he was known and recognized by all by
this name. This servant also mastered that same craft.

The mother of this lowly one was of the believers of Baghdad. Her
name was Dhikriyyih, a daughter of Ahmad Vallí. Her mother was
Khamiyyih, who attained the presence of the Blessed Beauty in the Holy
Land. She used to extemporize verses in Arabic in praise and admiration
of the Blessed Perfection, the Holy Family and other kindred, and would
bring joy to His blessed Person. <p.5> She passed away in Haifa during
that time.

8The ascension of Bahá’u’lláh took place on 29 May 1892.
9 According to Rúhiyyih Rabbání, The Priceless Pearl, p. 4, “On the 27th day of
Ramadan, 1314 of the Muslim calendar, Shoghi Effendi was born. This was Sunday,
1 March 1897 of the Gregorian calendar. These dates have been found in one of
Shoghi Effendi’s notebooks which he kept during his boyhood, written in his own
hand.”

It was during the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that my father,
Ustád Abú’l-Qásim Shahídzádih, passed from this nether world to the
everlasting abode. When His blessed Person [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] was
outwardly informed of this incident, He was so saddened that tears
poured from His blessed eyes. He attended the funeral in ‘Akká’s Bahá’í
cemetery in His carriage. He [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] used to say, “Ustád Abú’l-
Qásim was constant and firm like a mountain. Nothing would make him
waver, and in fact events would make him more steadfast and faithful.”

[The Covenant-breakers]
At a time of revolt and intensity in the Covenant-breaking, in one day
‘Abdu’l-Bahá repeatedly summoned him [my father] three times and
each time restated these utterances and blessed instructions along with
His exhortations and directions, “Ustád Abú’l-Qásim, I ask you, implore
you, that if with your own ears you heard the Covenant-breakers insult
Me, disregard it.” He greatly emphasized this point. His blessed intention
was for the friends of God to remain silent in face of the scorn and
uproar of the ill-wishing Covenant-breakers so that incidents that would
precipitate complications and difficulties resulting in harm to God’s
Cause were prevented.

[Ustád Abú’l-Qásim]
One night, a gathering was assembled in the blessed House in ‘Akká and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “May God’s mercy surround Ustád Abú’l-
Qásim. It was too soon.” Meaning he left this world too early.

One day, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had invited the friends of God to lunch in
the pilgrim house of Bahjí, situated next to the blessed Shrine [of
Bahá’u’lláh]. When He was welcoming the friends to sit for the meal and
serving each one, suddenly He said, “Ustád Abú’l-Qásim, Bismi’lláh.10
Welcome.” He then paused for a short while. It was certain that
everything stood evident before His Holiness and He was beholding the
spirits that were present and observant.

10   Lit. In the Name of God, it is an expression of welcome.

One day, He [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] was passing by my shop and saw that
I was engaged in work. He remarked, “Marhabá, marhabá!11 Give light to
your father’s shop!”12

[Muhammad-Hasan Khádim]
It was during the blessed days of the Guardian of the Cause of God –
may my spirit be a sacrifice unto him – that my paternal uncle, Áqá
Muhammad-Hasan, passed away in the blessed House [of ‘Abbúd] in
‘Akká, where, in accordance with the instructions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, these
ephemeral servants were in residence and in service. When the Guardian
of the Cause of God heard this news in Haifa, he dispatched one of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s turbans and instructed, “Adorn Áqá Muhammad-Hasan’s
head with this.” He also sent a bottle of perfume and by his instruction,
a number of friends from Haifa arrived and with utmost dignity, his
earthly remains were interred in the Bahá’í cemetery of ‘Akká. However,
his tombstone has not been raised until the present.

[Áqá Muhammad-Hasan] was the recipient of numerous Tablets
from the Blessed Perfection and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and was the object of
their utmost bounties and grace. This was because in accordance with
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s wish, he had devoted his life in service of the pilgrims in
the pilgrim houses of ‘Akká and Haifa and before that in Baghdad. For
this reason he had remained single and had never married.

In the course of his life, which was eighty-one years long, he had
prepared seven exquisite collections of Traces and Writings of the
Blessed Perfection and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. In truth, whoever saw them was
astonished and would express gratitude for his labor, since he had
arranged and prepared [these collections] with great beauty and
attractiveness. In consideration that these were among the most
important collections of Writings, these ephemeral servants jointly
presented those precious albums to <p.10> the blessed presence of the
Guardian of the Cause of God – may my spirit be a sacrifice unto him –
which brought immense joy to his blessed heart, and he spoke many
expressions of kindness. After a while, he informed us, “I have sent
11   Lit. Welcome, or well done.
12   Give light is a Persian expression, meaning give splendor, or glorify his work.

those collections to America for them to remain protected in their
archives as a remembrance [of Áqá Muhammad-Hasan].”

[‘Akká’s Bahá’í Cemetery]
Until the present, the Bahá’í cemetery of ‘Akká has not received due
attention and proper beautification. At one time, it was decided to raise a
wall around it. After some of this work was completed, one night, the
enemies of the Cause destroyed what had been built and it remains in the
same condition to this day.

[My Family]
My mother and brother, Adíb, passed away in the honored village of
‘Adasiyih.13 This was because after the upheavals that occurred in
Palestine and the Holy Land, the Guardian of the Cause of God – may
my life be a sacrifice unto him – willed that they should reside in that
region in order to be freed from certain complications.

Likewise, these ephemeral servants were instructed to migrate to
Tehran. At present, my brother, Dávud, and his wife and children
remain in that region [‘Adasiyih], situated in the eastern Jordan.

For thirty years, my mother served in the blessed House [of
‘Abbúd] in ‘Akká and was the recipient of immense favors and
considerations of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Greatest Holy Leaf – the Liege Lady
of the people of Bahá – and the beloved Guardian of the Cause, may my
spirit be a sacrifice unto the wrongs they suffered. She was extremely
faithful, devoted and pious.

In accordance with the all-encompassing wishes and the sovereign
will of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, my sister, Rafí‘ih Khánum, married Áqá ‘Abdu’r-
Rasúl Mansur [Kashání] in ‘Akká and from this union four children were
born, two boys and two girls: Áqá Ibráhím, Áqá Badí‘, Bihját Khánum,

13 At ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s urging, ‘Adasiyyih was settled by a number of Bahá’ís from
Yazd and its vicinity. For the most part, these believers were of Zoroastrian
background, but because they were experienced farmers, their presence in the
region dominated by Sunnis created almost no tension. This village is on the west
bank of the Jordan River, in the present day Jordan.

and Vidád Khánum.14 By the blessed instructions of the Guardian of
God’s Cause – may my life be a sacrifice unto his dominion – this family
also migrated from the Holy Land to Tehran. It was some time after
their arrival that Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl passed away, leaving this transient
world for the everlasting abode. Afterwards, my sister and her daughters
pioneered to America, and consequently were able to be pioneers twice.
Blessed are those who attain unto this!

One of the children of this servant was Nabíhih, who contracted
heart illness and passed away in Tehran. I implore the Almighty to
immerse her in the ocean of His forgiveness.

[Rely Upon God]
During the time of my father, one day in ‘Akká, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was
passing through the Súq Abyad where our shop was situated.15 I had
engraved an exquisite calligraphy that read, “Tawakkaltu ‘ala’lláh”16 and
was hanging on the door. When His blessed gaze fell upon it, He greatly
praised it and remarked, “Tayakulta ‘ala’lláh.” His blessed purpose was
that a person must place his reliance in God under all conditions.

[Calligraphy]
When I was a child and had not reached [the age of] maturity, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá gave a gold lira coin to my uncle, Áqá Muhammad-Hasan, stating,
“Give this [as tuition] to the calligraphy teacher.” He had added, “If he
[Khalíl Shahídí] would practice, his calligraphy would be like Mishkín-
Qalam’s. He must practice constantly.” That essence of sanctity was well

Arabic word, and meant, “Trust in God.”

aware that in the future this servant would be immersed in work and
industry and would not have time to exercise my calligraphy.

[Confirmations]
One year, on the morning of the Ridván Festival, the Most Mighty
Branch of God, the Mystery of God, the Interpreter of the divine verses
and the Center of divine Covenant and Testament, was in the blessed
House of ‘Akká <p.15> and all the friends of God were in His presence
as well. This servant had attained unto this bounty also.

He spoke in relation to the significance of that day, and all were
immersed in the sweetness of the ocean of His utterance. At that time,
with utmost earnestness, in my heart I implored that sanctified essence
to bestow confirmation upon me. He then [concluded the gathering and]
said, “Fí amáni’lláh.”17

All the believers rose and began to put on their shoes, as none
would come into His blessed presence while wearing shoes. In addition,
none would depart until they were given their leave, nor would they
enter [into the room] until summoned, since otherwise was outside the
bound of propriety and good manners. Besides, the dignity of His
Person prevented [anyone from doing otherwise].

As we were leaving His blessed room, suddenly He rose and came
outside the room as well. He placed His blessed right hand on the chest
of this unworthy servant and three times resonantly stated, “You are
successful; you are confirmed!” His repetition was as emphasis; that is to
say, “Be assured that you are successful and confirmed.”

Evidences of this utterance have ever since been thoroughly
visible, evident and clear to this servant, and undoubtedly will surround
me for the rest of my days as well. I implore His sacred Threshold to
sustain and confirm me in the Realm Above, and to deal with this
evanescent and lowly servant with His bounties and never-ending favors,
and to immerse me in the ocean of His absolution. In this regard, I am in
need of prayers.

17   Lit., Be under God’s protection; a form of Middle Eastern farewell.

[A Visit to Haifa]
When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was residing in Haifa, I attained His presence less
frequently. One day I went from ‘Akká for the sole purpose of attaining
His presence and when I arrived, out of compassion, grace and bounty,
He inquired, “Did you have something to discuss?” I said simply, “I
longed to see You.” He replied, “Any time you are in that state, you
should come.” He then added, “Stay here tonight.” I responded, “But it
might be an imposition.” He did not say anything; however, from His
blessed countenance it was evident that He was pleased with this
servant’s consideration.

[Memorization of the Writings]
Sometimes the beloved Master would instruct this servant to chant
prayers or recite Tablets.

One day, He was in the blessed House of ‘Akká and this
ephemeral being was going towards the House in order to attain His
presence, when from the upper window His vision fell upon this servant
and motioned me by hand to go into His blessed presence. After I
gained audience, He stated, “From now on, whatever you chant must be
from memory.” I bowed.

[Lawh Istiqámat]
The first Tablet that I began to memorize was a Tablet by the Blessed
Beauty about firmness, constancy and fortitude in the divine Covenant
and Testament, and it begins with these words, “He is the Holy, the Most
Glorious. O ye servants of the Merciful One! We admonish you to observe
trustworthiness, truthfulness and faithfulness, and to manifest the fear of God, the
Mighty, the Wise. Verily, he who holdeth fast to the fear of God is accounted among
those who occupy this sublime station.”18

The next time He [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] came from Haifa to ‘Akká and I
attained His presence, He instructed me to chant, and I recited this
Tablet.
18The cited lines are the opening passage of Bahá’u’lláh’s Lawh Istiqámat [Tablet of
Constancy]; see appendix 1.

Siyyid ‘Alí Afnán, who in those days was constantly vacillating in
his convictions, that is, for a while he associated with the thábitín
[faithful friends] and at other times with the náqizín [violators of the
Covenant], and whose story of infidelity is thoroughly told in the history
texts of the Cause, was in His presence on this occasion as well.19 As I
was chanting this Tablet, the following verse was reached: <p.20> “Can
it be possible that after the dawning of the day-star of Thy Testament above the
horizon of Thy Most Great Tablet, the feet of any one shall slip in Thy Straight
Path?”20 This sentence was a reference to the Center of the divine
Covenant and Testament.21

In short, when I reached this verse, [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] stated, “Áqá
Siyyid ‘Alí, do you hear what is revealed?” He then instructed, “Recite
this part again.” I chanted again. ‘Abdu’l-Baha restated, “Áqá Siyyid ‘Alí,
this is a verse of the Blessed Beauty! It is not my saying! Recite again.” I
recited the sentence a third time and He emphasized, “These are the
Words of the Blessed Beauty and not mine.” I then proceeded to chant
the rest of the Tablet. Afterwards, He said, “Marhabá!”

The news of this Tablet spread so famously that the Guardian of
the Cause of God memorized it at that time, and chanted it in a
gathering of the friends.

One day in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, this servant recited this
Tablet in the pilgrim house of the Shrine of the Báb [in Haifa], and He
remarked, “Give this Tablet to Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí to translate.”22

The Hájí did as bidden, but it was a literal rendering and when he
began to read it in His blessed presence, it did not meet with His
approval, since His purpose by translation was that the principal intent
be disclosed and divulged.

19 Siyyid ‘Alí Afnán was a son-in-law of Bahá’u’lláh and caused enormous difficulties
for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and others. For details, see, Afnán, Memories of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, (Trans. Ahang Rabbani), chapter 6; and Afnán, In the Land of Refuge:
The Genesis of the Bahá’í Faith in Shiraz, (trans. Ahang Rabbani), appendix 6.
20 Translation by Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p. 250.
21 At this point, the author gives a translation of this verse in Persian. Due to its

redundancy, this sentence has been omitted in the present translation.
22 Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet is in Arabic and presumably was not understood by most

Iranian Bahá’ís, who do not read Arabic.

From then on, with utmost enthusiasm, I would devote my leisure
hours to memorizing Tablets, divine verses and prayers.

[Visiting the Shrines]
One of the days of the week was devoted to visiting the blessed Shrine
[of Bahá’u’lláh], and that day was Sundays. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would be at
Bahjí, in the pilgrim house of the blessed Shrine. The friends of God in
‘Akká would visit the blessed Shrine [of Bahá’u’lláh] in the afternoon of
that day and the friends in Haifa would visit the Shrine of the Exalted
One [the Báb].

On that day, the friends of ‘Akká had won the bounty of visiting
the Shrine in His august presence [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], and He would
always remark, “Know the preciousness of these days!” From this
blessed expression, it was clear and evident that the eye of the world
would never again witness days such as these.

That night, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stayed in Bahjí and He instructed this
servant to remain in His presence. Until we retired for the night and our
rest, in accordance with His wish, the hours of the night were devoted to
chanting sacred verses and prayers. Afterwards, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to the
late Áqá Siyyid Abú’l-Qásim Khurásání, who in those days was the
custodian of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, and later, during the blessed
ministry of the Guardian of God’s Cause, succeeded in attaining to the
service of the custodianship of the Shrine of the Exalted One [the Báb],
to appoint a place for this servant to sleep. He emphasized, “Make sure
he is comfortable and does not catch cold.”

In the morning, after having breakfast, I was given my leave.

[Siyyid Abú’l-Qásim Khurásání]
The aforementioned Áqá Siyyid Abú’l-Qásim [Khurásání] was a most
faithful, devoted and sincere person. He passed away unexpectedly by
the Shrine of the Exalted One. The Guardian of the Cause of God –
may my spirit be a sacrifice unto his fidelity – was so saddened that for
three days he refused food. He would say, “My sight was not on his
service, but on his faith, certitude, sincerity and detachment.” The

Greatest Holy Leaf, may my spirit be a sacrifice for her meekness, would
say, <p.25> “You cannot imagine what an exalted station Áqá Siyyid
Abú’l-Qásim has attained in the world above!”

In accordance with instructions given to him, Áqá Siyyid Abú’l-
Qásim would spend the nights for protection [of the Shrines] at the
Mansion of Bahjí, and later at the Shrine of the Exalted One, but out of
respect would not consider it permissible to sleep freely, and would sit in
a corner until the morning. This was just an example of the immensity of
his goodly character.

One day in ‘Akká, he related for this servant:

> One of the eminent Jewish leaders [rabbis] had attained the
> sanctified presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Bahjí, and His blessed
> utterances were soaring in regard to the truth of Jesus and
the Messenger of God [Muhammad].

Out of his intense prejudice, that religious leader
recited a poem that he had in memory:

This with a bell peals out the chimes,

that lifts his voice from a towered height.
Each one proclaims his faith is true:

I wish I knew which one was right!23

By “This with a bell peals out the chimes,” and “that
> lifts his voice from a towered height,” he meant the religions
> of Jesus and Muhammad. Through this poem, he wanted to
> convey that both were false [Prophets]. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
> immediately responded back with the lines,

This faith is true, that a delight!

and yet the mob, an ugly sight,
Protested it with all their might!

I wish I knew which one was right!24

23   The original Arabic lines are:

> Hádhá bi-náqúsin yarinn, * wa dhá ‘alá ma’dhinin yasíh.

Kullun yusahhihu dínuh: * yá layta shi‘rí ma’s-sahíh!

However, while He was saying, “and yet the mob, an
> ugly sight,” He was pointing to him with His blessed hand,
> meaning, “You are that ugly sight who denies these two
> Dispensations.” Naturally, the man lost his composure and
> was irritated. However, once more [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] dealt with
> him softly and with kindness, until he recovered.

Three days after the passing of Áqá Siyyid Abú’l-Qásim, the
Guardian of the Cause of God instructed several of the friends in Haifa
to visit and take flowers to his resting-place. I was charged with reciting
prayers at his grave.

The Guardian would state, “Flowers should not be placed on the
casket; rather, after burial, place them on the gravesite.”

[Custodianship of the House of ‘Abbúd]
One day, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá summoned this servant from ‘Akká to Haifa.
After I attained His presence and received expressions of His kindness
and bounty, He said, “Many desire to reside in the blessed House [of
‘Abbúd], but I have chosen you from among the friends. Go and reside
in the House, but consider yourself the servant of the House, not its
resident.”

Therefore, that day we transferred our residence to the House,
that is, with my mother and brothers, Adíb and Dávud, we resided in the
House [of ‘Abbúd] and placed this crown of honor on our heads.
Whenever the pilgrims would come to pay homage [to the House], we
would stand to serve them and arrange for their comfort. On many
occasions, members of the Holy Household would come for a visit and
spend some time there. Moreover, at times, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá or the Greatest
Holy Leaf – the Liege Lady of the people of Bahá – would come also,
and on such excellent hours all of us would arise to serve them.

24   The original lines are:

> Hádhá sahíhun hádhá malíh; * wa-lákinna’l-qawma’l-qabíh
> Sára yunádí wa yasíh! * Yá layta shi‘rí ma’s-sahíh

One day around noon, I returned to the House from work. On
arrival, my gaze fell upon the beauteous countenance of the beloved
Master, Who was sitting at the lunch table. At that moment, I was deeply
perturbed that I had not been informed of His blessed arrival, even
though my mother had prepared all the necessary provisions for lunch.
Nevertheless, I was sad that I had not been there to welcome Him. That
Essence of Holiness had asked of this unworthy servant from my
mother and she had replied, “He is not aware of the Master’s visit.”

[The Master]
During the days of His blessed Person, all the friends would refer to
‘Abdu’l-Bahá as Sarkár Áqá [the Master]. The Ancient Beauty, exalted is
His mighty mention, would refer to Him as Áqá. And if someone would
refer to another of the Aghsán other than ‘Abdu’l-Baha <p.30> as Áqá,
Bahá’u’lláh would state, “There is only one Áqá. That is, the appellation
Áqá belongs solely to the Most Mighty Branch.”

[The Covenant-Breakers]
In short, [that day at lunch], when I came into the room, I immediately
bowed [to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], and He saw me and said, “Bismi’lláh, Áqá
Khalíl. Come, sit and partake of lunch.” I saw that Subhí25 was also
sitting on the right side of the Master and a chair was empty on His left.
[‘Abdu’l-Baha] said, “Sit.” So, I sat on the chair to His left.

Suddenly and immediately, [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] remarked, “Khalíl, you
know that for fifteen years I tolerated ‘Abdu’l-Karím and he thought that
I was unaware of his deeds.” Then He turned His blessed Visage to
Subhí and said, “If the entire world were to array [itself before Me], they
would be helpless to take a hair from my head.” Three times, He
repeated, “My succor and support is the Blessed Beauty!” He uttered
these words so resonantly and powerfully that the entire Blessed House
was vibrating by its effect!

‘Abdu’l-Karím that was mentioned [by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] was known
as Ustád ‘Abdu’l-Karím Kharrát [turner] and was from Isfahan. This
person secretly and stealthily associated with the Covenant-breakers, and
in truth was their spy. When the marble sarcophagus destined to contain
the sacred remains of His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb] – may my
soul be a sacrifice unto His pure blood – arrived from India to Haifa,
and was in process of being moved to the Shrine of the Exalted One,
and interred in its permanent and lasting spot, one of the individuals
who outwardly was serving this purpose was the same ‘Abdu’l-Karím.

25 Faydu’lláh Muhtadí, known as Subhí, a son of Áqá Muhammad-Husayn, was
related to Bahá’u’lláh’s third wife, Gawhar Khánum. He was a secretary of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá for some ten years and later sided with ‘Abdu’l-Husayn Áyatí, known as
Ávárih, and opposed Shoghi Effendi. For many years, he vacillated in his
convictions; each time would repent, only to resume his opposition later. In a letter
dated 26 December 1928, Shoghi Effendi explains, “Regarding Subhí’s situation, his
acceptance and return is conditioned and requires that he should write, in utmost
clarity, in his own hand and his own words, a confessional and admission letter
similar to his recent letter to the National Spiritual Assembly [of Iran]. This letter
should then be distributed among the friends, so all would learn of his change of
condition and for it to serve as means of repentance to the enemies of the Cause.”

At that time, [Mírzá] Majdi’d-Dín was one of the pillars sustaining
the violators of the Covenant, and according to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
description he was the teacher of Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí (the arch-
Covenant-breaker). This person [Majdi’d-Dín] had hidden behind the
olive trees, so that at an opportune time ‘Abdu’l-Karím would guide and
allow him enter and survey the condition and situation of the Shrine of
the Exalted One.

Therefore, at noon, when the servants working there had
dispersed for their lunch break, ‘Abdu’l-Karím thought it timely, and
with hand-signal motioned [Mírzá] Majdi’d-Dín, beckoning him to enter
the Shrine of the Exalted One. He had immediately entered [the Shrine]
and seen all that he wanted to survey and became closely aware of the
details.

It so happened that at that moment the custodian of the Shrine of
the Exalted One, Áqá Rahmatu’lláh, who was from Najaf-Abad in
Isfahan, had noticed this scene and quickly informed [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. On
hearing of this incident, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had instantly expelled26 him
[‘Abdu’l-Karím], and from then he had openly joined the Covenant-
breakers.

After his death, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “For three days and
nights, his soul was suspended between earth and heaven and did not
know where to go.”

This was only a sample of his deeds and behaviors. The rest can be
ascertained by the same pattern.

In short, in consideration that, like him, Subhí also secretly
associated with the ill-wishing Covenant-breakers and carried out
oppositions, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was deeply disappointed with him. He had
even imitated His blessed signature [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá].27 At the time
[lunch hour] when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was severely rebuking him, he seemed
dead, as if his soul had left his body.

26The original tard also implied excommunication.
27The implication might be that Suhbí had forged documents, perhaps Tablets, in
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s hand.

At all events, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spent that night in the House [of
‘Abbúd], but His blessed condition had become disturbed over this
incident and part of the night He was ill.28

Some time later, he [Subhí] was dismissed and sent to Iran [by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. In Tehran he joined the enemies of the Cause, and his
end was naught but manifest loss.

[A Note by the Narrator]
It should be clear to the esteemed readers that these recollections are
composed without any preliminaries or conclusions, or citing specific
dates. This is because the passage of time and days has robbed this
servant of that ability. However, the events recorded, or those that will
be recounted, are mentioned without any addition or loss. Due to the
passage of time, I may have forgotten some small details of certain
incidents, and therefore have not recorded those events [in this
narrative], nor will they appear in the subsequent pages.

[Remains of the Báb]
<p.35> When the sacred remains of His Holiness the Exalted One [the
Báb] – may my soul be a sacrifice unto His meekness – arrived from Iran
to Haifa, and that region and the Holy Land became light upon light, this
mighty glad-tidings had not been shared with the beloved friends of
God. In ‘Akká, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “If I were to tell you what happy
tidings I bear, old men would dance in joy alone in their rooms! But I
cannot disclose it.”

From one direction, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s blessed will had decreed to
cheer the friends’ hearts that had been saddened and made sorrowful
from wave after wave of the Covenant-breakers’ [misconduct], but from
another direction, wisdom did not permit its disclosure at that time.
However, this blessed statement [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] brought great joy and
happiness to each one of the friends of God.

28Mu’ayyad, Eight Years Near ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: The Diary of Dr. Habíb Mu’ayyad, (Trans.
Ahang Rabbani), extensively discusses how the conduct of the Covenant-breakers
would impact and impair ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s health.

[Iran]
One night there was a gathering in the blessed House of ‘Akká, and the
friends of God were in the presence of Him round Whom all the names
revolve [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. He remarked, “A day will come when the people
of Iran will go to bed as Muslims and wake in the morning all Bahá’ís!”
His blessed purpose [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] was that Iran [unreadable] would
enter beneath [the banner] of the Cause of God.

[Diffusion of the Faith]
During the days of the Guardian of the Cause of God, an [annual]
gathering was organized in the shadow of the Shrine of the Exalted One
to commemorate the ascension of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and many friends from
different regions would be in attendance and beholding the blessed
countenance [of the Guardian]. The blessed utterances [of Shoghi
Effendi] were:

> When a century that has passed from the Manifestation of
> the Primal Point [the Báb], the world will become spiritual,
> and people will embrace and associate with the divine
> religion. However, a century after the Appearance of
> Bahá’u’lláh, the world will become the divine paradise, and
> the promise in the sacred Qur’an, “Will enter the Cause of
> God by troops,”29 will stand fulfilled.30

[Iran’s Future]
One day a group of the friends of God was in the presence of the
Guardian of the Cause of God in the pilgrim house of the Shrine of the
Exalted One. He spoke words to this effect: “Iran, particularly Tehran,

29 Qur’an 110:2 reads, “And thou seest mankind entering the religion of God in
troops.
30 Most likely a reference to the conclusion of the Ten-Year Crusade, 1953-63,

which witnessed the spread of the Bahá’í Faith to all regions of the globe.

will also greatly advance from the point of view of economics,
commerce, agriculture and industry.”

[Visit to the Shrines]
In consideration that the Jews who had come from abroad to the Holy
Land, and who would come with the utmost courtesy, reverence,
cleanliness and refinement on a visit to the Shrines of Bahá’u’lláh and the
Exalted One, the Guardian of the Cause of God would remark on such
occasions: “They are very luminous, even though we have not spoken
with them [about the Faith]. If we were to discuss the Cause, there
would be upheaval between the two factions of the Jews and the Arabs.
However, the time for it will come. They are presently engaged in
organizing their affairs. Later they will arise in service to the Cause. Now
is the beginning of exaltation of the Jews and the beginning of the
abasement of Islam. ‘Truly thy Lord will decide between them on the day
of resurrection concerning that in which they differed.’31”

His blessed purpose in quoting this sacred verse that has been
revealed in the Qur’an was to explain that the abasement of the Jews was
decreed to last until the Day of Resurrection, namely, until the Day of
the Manifestation of the promised Qá’ím. Therefore, that abasement had
now ended. He would add, “The Muslims will be humiliated far more
than the Jews. But their punishment is quick and then their abasement
will turn into glory.” His blessed point was that, unlike the Jews, their
disgrace would not last long as they will quickly enter the Cause of God
so they would be freed from humiliation.

[A Humorous Story]
There was a Christian priest in ‘Akká who regularly attained the presence
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. One day other Christians asked him, “What benefit
have you gained from visiting ‘Abbás Effendi so frequently?” He replied,
“Soon I will baptize ‘Abbás Effendi!” When this news reached His
[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s] blessed ears, He replied, “Very well. We will see
whether he baptizes us or we circumcise him.”
31   For comparison, see Qur’an 2:113, 10:93, 22:17 and 45:17.

It was not long thereafter <p.40> that the priest fell ill. No matter
what the doctors tried, it had no effect, and indeed he grew worse.
Eventually it was decided that a team of doctors would consult on his
condition. Those doctors decided to examine him and consulted on his
situation and when they completed their examination, they prescribed
that no remedy except circumcision would cure him. After they decided
conclusively on this, they carried out the surgery.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá – may my life be a sacrifice unto His will – would
smile and say, “I made that comment in humor.”

Subsequently, whenever that priest would come before Him, he
was most embarrassed and would keep his head low. It became clear
from this incident that the Manifestations of Truth33 do not jest with
anyone, since their humor is also serious.34

[Shaykh Mahmúd, the Muftí]
There was a certain person in ‘Akká by the name of Shaykh Mahmúd
‘Arrabí. According to the sayings of the earlier and elder believers, he
was a most courageous and brave man, such that all inhabitants of ‘Akká
and the surrounding regions feared him.

One day he saw ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Jámi‘ Jazzár [Mosque of al-Jazzár]
performing His ablutions. He [came forth and] stated, “You are the Son
of God.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “That is what you say.” Once more,
he stated the same thing, only to be given the same answer. This time,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá added, “O Shaykh Mahmúd, have you not read the Qur’an,

32 Often the narrator uses the term smile in place of laugher.
33 Haqq, an Arabic word meaning truth, is often used in Islamic and Bahá’í writings
to refer to God. It also means righteous and the quality of Ultimate Reality in
mysticism. Haqq is one of the 99 Names of God found in the Qur’an. In the Tablet
of the Branch, Bahá’u’lláh writes of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: Verily, He is the remembrance of
God amongst you and His trust within you, and His manifestation unto you and His
appearance among the servants who are nigh.”
34 This story is also told in: Mu’ayyad, Eight Years near ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: The Diary of Dr.

Habíb Mu’ayyad, (Trans. Ahang Rabbani), chap. 6.

‘Honor thy guests though they be infidels’?”35 As soon as the Shaykh
heard this verse, his anger subsided, and since outwardly ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
had not met him [previously], nor heard of his name, this incident greatly
added to his wonder.

Later on, he fervently came into the blessed presence [of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá] and eventually embraced the Cause, attaining deep faith and
certitude. Moreover, his whole family came under the canopy of the
Cause.

I have heard that during the month of Ramadan, he [Shaykh
Mahmúd] had spread a feast in ‘Akká’s bazaar and was offering food to
every passer-by. When this news reached the blessed ears [of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá], He quickly summoned him and strongly forbade him this
conduct. He had asked, “Is it not true that the laws have changed?”
[‘Abdu’l-Bahá] responded, “Yes, but wisdom is required. Now is not the
time.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would remark, “I can convert the entire population
of ‘Akká in three days, but the harm [of doing this] exceeds the benefit.”

At all events, one day this person [Shaykh Mahmúd] had
submitted to His blessed presence [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], “I wish to give
surety to the government for the dairy animals36 and receive them from
the farmers at the harvest time.” However, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá did not deem
this agreeable and had prohibited him from so doing.

Nevertheless, he had thought that such dealings were worldly and
financial matters and not of spiritual affairs, and therefore he had
considered his own knowledge superior, particularly since he anticipated
that considerable profit could be gained through this undertaking. In
short, he acquired the right to the dairy animals for a fixed and specified
surety, on the condition that upon collection and gathering, he would
pay that sum to the government. However, after commencing this
undertaking, he realized that a grievous and irreparable loss had occurred

35 Probably from the hadith (“sayings”) of Muhammad. However, there is a related
verse of the Qur’an: 4:86, “When ye are greeted with a greeting, greet ye with a
better than it or return it. Lo! Allah taketh count of all things.”
36 The original is not clear on this word, and it can be read in two different ways:

either as dairy animals or one-tenth (which presumably would be the farming tax).
When the original manuscript is made available to researchers, this word should be
checked more closely.

and discovered that he was unable to reimburse his large debt to the
government. When he found himself perplexed and remorseful in this
situation, it became evident to him that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s knowledge was
not bounded, nor specified [to certain matters], nay, it encompassed the
whole of universe and creation and nothing remained concealed from
Him, nor will it ever remain so.

He then attained ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence <p.45> and threw his
corpulent body on His blessed feet and fervently cried and lamented [in
repentance]. With the utmost compassion and mercy, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, that
manifestation of kindness and grace, gently lifted him up, so that later,
[the Shaykh] had reported, “Despite my large body, I was like a tender
bird in His blessed hands!” To the extent possible, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, that
embodiment of benevolence and sympathy, had assisted him financially
until he was able to recover.

At one time, locust attack had enveloped the region to the point
that not a shred of greenery could be found. Shaykh Mahmúd ‘Arrábí
owned a large olive grove outside the city of ‘Akká. He came to the
blessed presence [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] and stated, “I want to go and see the
condition of the orchard.” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] replied, “Your olive trees are
safe from the locusts. There is no need to go.”

However, after two or three days, as he was anxious [about the
trees], he mounted his horse intending to inspect his grove. However, as
he rode, he observed that a thick cloud of locust, like a resolute army,
followed him. When he came close to the grove, he saw that the trees
were verdant and green, but about to be attacked by the locusts and to
be destroyed. He instantly grew repentant and remorseful of having
acted contrary to His blessed advice and will, and quickly turned his
steed around. As he turned back, the locusts also followed, and as such,
his trees remained intact. This incident greatly increased his faith and
certitude.

[Khalíl ‘Arrábí]
After he passed away, his children and descendants stood ready to serve,
and, due to their presence, the enemies of the Cause were powerless to
rebel to some degree. During the World War [I], one of his sons known

as Khalíl ‘Arrábí, who had a family, had gone to one of the villages of
‘Akká, named Kuwaykat, in search of food, but had been unsuccessful.
On his return from the village, his path came by [the Mansion of] Bahjí.
That day, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá – may my spirit be a sacrifice for His sacred
tomb – was in the pilgrim house situated next to the Shrine of
Bahá’u’lláh. He instructed the aforementioned Áqá Siyyid Abú’l-Qásim
Khurásání to go wait on the road so that upon arrival he would invite
[‘Arrábí] to His presence. Khalíl ‘Arrábí was deeply astonished that
without being outwardly aware of his journey or plans, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had
summoned him to His presence in this manner.

In short, he attained the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and since it was
noon, he was invited to table for lunch. However, worried over the
condition of his children, he was deeply perturbed and unable to eat.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, however, consoled and assured him. After lunch, He
bestowed a finger-length stack of gold lira coins to him, saying,
“Whenever these are spent, come and I will give you more,” and then he
was given his leave.

It must be obvious what state came over him. In truth, he was
ready to offer his life [for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. Upon his return to ‘Akká, he
first bought a basket full of bread, which was the necessary sustenance,
and then with great joy went home. Afterward, he invited a number of
relatives and said to them, “This plentiful feast is because of the
generosity and bounties of His Holiness ‘Abbás Effendi.” <p.50> He
then told them of the events.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Chant]
One day, this servant and two or three other of the friends were in the
presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Bahjí. After attaining to our true purpose
and beholding the peerless countenance of our Beloved, we were given
our leave. However since we had not visited the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh –
though we had achieved and attained the essence of visitation – this
servant inquired, “Do You grant us permission to visit the Shrine [before
leaving]?” He instantly rose, took a few steps, and replied, “Visiting [the
Shrine] does not require permission.”

After we had illumined our faces by the effulgence of the Sacred
Threshold, His blessed Person chanted the Tablet of Visitation with a
melody that will never again be heard for the rest of eternity. Upon
coming out of the Shrine, we were given our leave.

My paternal uncle, Áqá Muhammad-Hasan, related that after the
ascension of the Ancient Beauty – exalted be His mighty mention – one
day the chant and melody of the Blessed Beauty was heard. Everyone
was most bewildered as to the source of this invocation when suddenly
they discovered that the tone of that Promised Manifestation was heard
from their laudable Master [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. However, He had
immediately changed the manner of His chant, as the intonation of the
Truth belongs solely to the Truth.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
My father, Ustád Abú’l-Qásim Shahídzádih, related: “One day when the
Blessed Beauty was strolling, I was in His presence. He remarked, ‘Áqá
Abú’l-Qásim, say [what you wish].’ In my heart, I said, ‘After the Blessed
Beauty, I see none other than the Most Mighty Branch of God worthy of
this station.’ He replied, ‘Marhabá!’”

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Return in December 1913]
On the day that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had returned from His journeys to western
countries, and had arrived and resumed residence in the blessed House
in Haifa, the friends in ‘Akká collectively hastened by the rail-train to
visit that Beloved of the horizons. We were so profoundly ecstatic that
uncontrollably we were laughing and crying, and while singing songs and
anthems, though it was contrary to wisdom, entered the blessed House
[of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. We learned, however, that the arch-Covenant-breaker
[Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí] and his collaborators were in the presence of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, but it was evident that their purpose was not godly.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was informed that the friends of ‘Akká had arrived. He
replied, “They should wait.”

Meanwhile, that pivot of rebellion37 had said [to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá],
“You return was delayed.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had replied, “Such was
decreed.” Every reader or hearer of this description can fathom with
what loathsome manner he had spoken these words in the presence of
the Center of the divine Covenant and Testament.

When they had observed ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s frailty and weariness
[because of the long journey], they had thought their goal was within
grasp and had given this glad tidings to one another. However,
afterwards, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “It is not as it seems,” and these
blessed words had greatly cheered the hearts of the people of Bahá,
causing them to spread feasts of thanksgiving and joy.

When [‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s] passing took place, the pivot of rebellion
and Covenant-breakers wanted to enter the blessed House [of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá], but by the instructions of the Greatest Holy Leaf, the Liege Lady
of the people of Bahá – may my life be a sacrifice unto her meekness –
the friends had prevented their entrance and offered some excuse.
Remorseful and downcast, they left.

In short, we have strayed far from our main story. After the
rapscallion Covenant-breakers had left the blessed presence, the friends
were summoned, and at that time, each of us reverently, humbly and
respectfully, prostrated ourselves on the ground and kissed ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s feet, alighted our eyes and gladdened and thrilled our hearts. That
hour was an hour that can never be described by words or otherwise.
“Exalted and lofty is that sanctified presence and that hallowed station.”

When He had asked after our health and showered us with His
bountiful expressions of favor and grace, He stated, “We went, sowed
seeds and now wait for the harvest.”

Thereupon, He bade us farewell by saying, “Fí amáni’lláh,” and we
left His presence. Praise be unto God that with our earthly eyes we
witnessed what hyacinths of <p.55> learning and divine recognition
have bloomed and blossomed across the world from those very seeds.

[The Mansion]
37 A reference to Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí, who in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament
is referred to as the center of sedition.

During the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the spiteful Covenant-breakers
even schemed for complete ownership of the Mansion of Bahjí. As such,
they approached certain individuals in the government offices who had
long years of experience, and tempted them into rendering influence in
this regard.

Included among them was a certain Turkish physician by the name
of Zakí Bayk, who exerted great efforts in this path. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came
face to face with him in one of the streets of ‘Akká and in Turkish said
to him, “Even if you swallow the Mansion like a mouthful, I will put my
hand down your throat and pull it out from your stomach!” From this
strongly worded censure, he recognized that all his efforts and exertions
would be futile, and therefore had sought through an intermediary to
appeal for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s forgiveness. [From this incident,] others grew
repentant as well.

There was a certain Shaykh Ibráhím ‘Akkí in ‘Akká, who was an
abúkatu, that is, he was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s attorney, and appointed to
undertake tasks associated with the Mansion [of Bahjí]. One day,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá went to see him in his residence in order to ensure that he
would not be tempted and influenced by the enemies [of the Cause].
However, he pretended to be ill. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked for Dr. Nikúlákí,
who was a Christian and a righteous man, to come. The physician came
at once and offered a prescription. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá instructed for the
[prescribed] medicine to be readied. When it was brought, He placed
gold coins stacking a finger-length next to the medicine and said [to
Shaykh Ibráhím], “Take whichever of these two is the remedy of your ill,
but the affairs of the Mansion must be concluded satisfactorily.” With
that, He left, and afterwards [Shaykh Ibráhím] said, “Not Moses, not
Christ and not Muhammad!” He meant that none of these
Manifestations wielded the scepter of authority as His blessed Person
did!

[Attempts on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Life]
Dr. Nikúlákí Bayk was the physician of the Holy Family. Previously in
his youth he had served as a physician in the Ottoman military. The
Covenant-breakers had asked him to poison ‘Abdu’l-Bahá during the

course of his examination, but he quickly informed and exhorted [the
Holy Family], ensuring that not a moment was neglected in ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s protection. Afterwards, for a while even ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s food was
prepared separately, in a special, secure38 room.

The Covenant-breakers had even asked ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Christian
coachman, a certain Rúhanná, to derail His carriage in a ravine on the
way to Bahjí. They had given him some money beforehand and
promised to give a substantial sum after the execution and completion of
their plan. However, once the carriage had deviated a little from the main
path, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá vehemently shouted, and spoke with great intensity,
inquiring of his intention. Being frightened and having lost his will-
power, [the coachman] confessed to the plan and later was discharged.

Thereupon, Isfandiyár who had been trained by him [the
Christian] was appointed the faithful coachman. He passed away in the
blessed house [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] in Haifa during the ministry of the
Guardian of the Cause of God.

[Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí]
During the days of rebellion of the violators of the Covenant, the arch-
Covenant-breaker [Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí] had said, “‘Alí had the right,
but it was ‘Umar who exerted and succeeded.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá – may my
spirit be a sacrifice unto Him – sent word to him, “Neither do you have
the courage of ‘Umar, nor am I like ‘Alí who remained silent and still.”
He added, “What I write in Persian, he copies in Arabic and what I write
in Arabic, he reproduces in Persian.” From this blessed remark [of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá] it was evident that he [Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí] was bereft
of qualities and indeed was no more than a cover [for others]39.

Presently also an ignorant one40 is found that similar to the arch-
Covenant-breaker and the pivot of sedition, commits such treacherous
deeds, stringing certain phrases from the divine verses and heavenly

38 Original dar-bastih, implies that the room was locked from within.
39 The word qishr, translated as cover, also refers to a person concerned with the
outward form of religious law, who disregards or is unaware of their true intent.
40 bí-daráyat has been translated as ignorant. However, technically it refers to the

science of distinguishing true from false prophetic hadith.

Tablets and calls them revealed verses and tablets; or imitates certain
prophecies and divinations about future events that occur in the Writings
and attributes them to himself.41 <p.60> He even has introduced
bewildering and strange interpretations of the laws and evident verses
which have been sent down from the heaven of Bahá by the King;
whereas evident laws are beyond interpretation and elucidation. He has
thought that in this way he would win victories and triumph. But alas,
alas, to vain imaginings.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá would state, “What I state in accordance with the
needs and the requirements of the time, Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí (the
Covenant-breaker) repeats the exact same in unsuitable and
inappropriate places, and therefore his words have no effect.”

There was a certain lawyer in ‘Akká by the name of Shaykh
‘Abdu’r-Rahman ‘Azízí, who in a gathering had spoken words that
previously ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had said to him. Even though he was a non-
Bahá’í, [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] censured him for this. Indeed no treachery can be
imagined greater than this: that a person, because of his own false and
corrupt imaginings, attributes to himself words spoken by others,
particularly when those words and remarks have streamed from the will
and tongue of the All-Merciful.

In short, this unenlightened and spiteful imitator [Mírzá
Muhammad-‘Alí], who was the pivot of rebellion, eventually became
blind and sightless, and in the utmost misery and rejection left this world
for the lowest abyss. “Be warned and repentant ye the men of pride,
false imagination and imitation!”

One of the pillars of the Covenant-breakers brought a quantity of
divine verses and Tablets to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, thinking that he had
marshaled proofs [against ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], but without even looking at
them, [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] stated, “Throw away these scraps of papers, as
what I say is final!” His blessed intent was that they must come beneath
the divine Covenant and Testament.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, “Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí (the arch-
Covenant-breaker) has one happy thought, and that is that after Me it

41The original text mixes singular and plural and, therefore, it is unclear whether a
specific person or a group of opponents of the Faith is being discussed.

will be him.42 However, with my own hands I will shroud and bury him.”
After His blessed ascension, one of the Covenant-breakers by the name
of [Mírzá] Mustafa Abú-Hurayrih43 had said to Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl
Mansúr, who passed away in Tehran, “What happened to that statement
that He [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] said He would shroud and bury Mírzá
Muhammad-‘Alí with His own hands?” He responded, “O wretched
one! What shrouding and burying is greater than replacing him with a
youth!”44

One time, [Mírzá] Majdi’d-Dín, who was the main pillar of the
Covenant-breakers, attained the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for a certain
purpose. After considerable admonishments and counsels, the blessed
tears of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá poured out, because He was disheartened over the
deeds and doings of the violators of the Testament. Majdi’d-Dín,
however, quietly started to laugh, presumable thinking how powerful and
skillful he was to have brought tears to His blessed Person. Suddenly,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “I weep over your condition and you laugh! Get up
and leave!” With anger and fury, he was thrown out.

One time Mírzá Badí‘u’lláh, the brother of the arch-Covenant-
breaker, returned, and according to his own reckoning repented, the
details of which are available in history books of the Faith. When he saw
that he would not be able to achieve his true purpose or realize his vain
imaginings, once again he raise rebellion and joined the Covenant-
breakers. His deeds and evil behavior reached such a point that he hid
seditious papers under the mattress and bed in the blessed bedroom [of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá], so that whenever the Investigation Committee sent on
behalf of the government – which came at the provocation of the
Covenant-breakers themselves – conducted a search, then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
would fall into trouble. However, since ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had instructed the
Household to carefully search and watch the room, therefore those
papers were found.

42 Bahá’u’lláh’s Kitáb ‘Ahd had ordained for Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí to assume
leadership after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. However, because he violated the Covenant, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá excommunicated him in His Will and Testament.
43 He had been an attendant of Bahá’u’lláh and named Abú-Hurayrih after a fickle

follower of Muhammad.
44 A short sentence appears to have been erased at this point.

Later ‘Abdu’l-Bahá excommunicated him [Mírzá Badí‘u’lláh]. He
had asked that a written statement <p.65> be given [by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá].
But He responded, “I said leave, then leave!” Everyone heard that.

One time, [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] took an oath, “By God, besides Whom
there is no other god! I will appear with the perspicuous serpent.45”
When He spoke that oath, my father, Ustád Abú’l-Qásim, was in His
blessed presence and was so thrilled and overjoyed on hearing this that
he kissed both blessed shoulders [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. His meaning by
“perspicuous serpent” was the blessed person of the Guardian of the
Cause of God, who, like a dragon, destroyed and obliterated all the
Covenant-breakers.

One of the inhabitants of ‘Akká was exhibiting great opposition.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “He needs a slap.” Next day that person died. It
was said to His blessed presence, “He received his slap,” but He did not
respond.

[Dietary Considerations]
There was a gathering in the blessed House of Haifa and the friends of
God were assembled around the One “round Whom all names
revolve,”46 and for some reason a discussion of watermelon took place.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “Watermelon is cool.” He then added, “His
Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb] would not eat humectants.
Whenever overcome by heat, He would pour a little lemon juice in water
and drink that beverage. This was the humectants of His Holiness the
Exalted One.”

He also stated, “His Holiness the Exalted One has said that if a
person spends two-thirds of his money on sweets, he has not spent
excessively.” From this statement it can be understood that man needs
sweets more than humectants or other food items.”

45 In ancient religions, serpents were often represented as potent guardians of
temples and other sacred spaces.
46 A title of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, often used in the original manuscript (though in most

instances it has been replaced with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá).

[The Fast]
One time ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “A person does not become corpulent
because of excessive eating.”

> The Guardian of the Cause of God used to fast without breakfast.

At the beginning, when wisdom in certain matters was most
necessary and essential, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would fast during Ramadan. It was
suggested to His blessed presence not to observe the [Muslim] fast.
However, He said, “Since people believe that I am fasting, if I do not
maintain it, then it would be a deceit.”

Even in Haifa, at times He would invite Muslim clergymen to the
guesthouse at the top of the Mount Carmel for the evening break of the
fast or to have breakfast [at the start of the fast]. However, all the food
was prepared in the blessed House [in Haifa]. At dawn, all the delicious
food that was prepared would be conveyed by carriage to the
aforementioned place by Khusraw, the servant of the blessed House, or
Isfandiyár, and be readied. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would not rest until the dawn.
After breakfast, in the company of the guests, He would descend Mount
Carmel. He would sustain all this toil and difficulty solely for the
protection of God’s Cause.

During the days of the Ancient Beauty – may His mention be
exalted – two or three of the friends acted unwisely during the month of
Ramadan. When this was mentioned before His sacred Presence, He
stated, “If both fasts are ordained, then what will occur?” That is, both
the Bayání and the Qur’anic fasts. The believers said to them [i.e. the two
or three Bahá’ís who had not observed the Islamic fast], “Do not act in
such a way that until the end of time people would curse you!” That is, if
the Blessed Beauty were to ordain both fasts, then you would have
caused it.

In short, later these observances were gradually reduced.

Nevertheless, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would not neglect wisdom. He would say,
“If by sunset the friends [i.e. Bahá’ís] have not reached their homes, then
they should quicken their pace.” His blessed purpose was so that no one
would think that they are not fasting.

Even some years during the Festivity of Sacrifice,47 He would
sacrifice sheep.

However, during the blessed days of the Guardian of God’s
Cause, such observances48 were completely eliminated. During one of
the Muslim festivals, several people in Haifa came by the entrance to the
blessed House to offer festival greetings. <p.70> However, he [Shoghi
Effendi] stated, “Tell them that this is not our festival.” They were
advised of the dates of Bahá’í festivals. In consideration of the
requirements of the period, the Guardian of the Cause of God had
willed that his precious time, which was strained due to the voluminous
work of the Cause, should not be spent on such unfruitful and
unprofitable persons.

[Feeding Haifa-‘Akká Area]
During World War [I] famine occurred, to the point that the poor and
hapless were dying of hunger. Not even salt could be found, and people
were forced to use sea-salt in its place.

That year, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá instructed the ‘Adasiyyih farmers, who
were mostly Bahá’ís of Zoroastrian descent, to expand their wheat
farming. With great zeal and determination, they began to plant. At the
height of summer and despite the intense heat of ‘Adasiyyih, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá proceeded to that region at the harvest time to ensure that the
necessary provisions for Bahá’ís and others were gathered.

The wheat was loaded on camels and sent to Haifa and ‘Akká.

However, the delivery of the grain was not easy, since people were
hungry [and would attack the caravan]. Only the power and influence of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was able to force the government to ensure protection of
the transfer [from ‘Adasiyyih]. In addition to all the Bahá’ís, so many
47  ‘Id-i Qurbán or ‘Id-i Adha, is a festival celebrated by the Muslims in
commemoration of Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice his son for God. This
festivity is four days long and begins on the 10th of Dhi’l-Hajjih, and on that day,
pilgrims to the Holy Shrines in Mecca and Medina offer a sacrifice, as do other
Muslims in other lands.
48 The word used for observance is hikmat, which is usually rendered as wisdom. The

implication is that such an observance of wisdom, which in this case resembles
dissimulation, no longer occurred.

others and the poor received their sustenance from the bounties and
favors of that benefactor [‘Abdu’l-Bahá].

However, the intense heat impaired ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s health. He
instructed that a canopy be made of thistles and water be sprinkled [on
the grounds] so He would rest a little under it.

The wheat harvest that year was most plentiful, to the point that
they could not collect it all from the farm, and next year grew again.

In those days, [one day] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was walking in a street. He
saw that a Christian from one of the villages was passing by along with
his young son. The lad was saying, “Father, I am hungry.” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
said to them, “Come with Me.” Together, they went to the blessed
House, and by His instructions, food was prepared and readied for them.
After they had eaten amply from the spread feast, He stated in effect,
“Lease a donkey and load a bag of flour, and conduct it to their home.”
That person [the Christian] was most puzzled, as he did not know
‘Abdu’l-Bahá from the past. However, after he had investigated he had
learned of His precious and blessed Person.

In short, this situation passed until the blessed ascension [of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá] occurred. When that person learned of this dark news, he
began to lament and wail with great intensity. When asked what had
provoked this intense emotion, he responded, “It was because of the
generosity and openhandedness of this sacred and sanctified Person that
we are alive today. Otherwise, my family and I would have died of
starvation and hunger.” He then recounted what had occurred.

One day the aforementioned Siyyid ‘Alí Afnán was at the blessed
dinning table [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. After the meal, he uttered, “Praise unto
God!” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked, “Why do you praise?” He responded, “In
consideration that we attained unto this bounty.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated,
“Praise should be offered when one satisfies the hunger of a hungry
person.”

[The Sea of the Cause]
One day ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to one of the pilgrims in Haifa, “Let us walk
a little.” They strolled to the port. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “Yesterday it
rained. The sea needed water. She accepted the clouds unto herself and

today the sea is surging forth. However, the sea of the Cause <p.75> has
not surged forth yet.” The point of His blessed Person was that when
the sea of the Cause has surged, then like this sea [of Haifa], it would
refuse to accept any filth. Accordingly, now that the Universal House of
Justice has been established, the sea of the Cause has flowed forth in a
way that is evident and manifest unto all.

There was a certain ‘Abbás-Qulí of Qum, who for some time
served as the custodian of the Shrine of the Exalted One [the Báb].
During the blessed days of the Guardian of the Cause of God, he passed
away by the Shrine of the Exalted One. He used to relate that one time
one of the Covenant-breakers had said to him, “Has the Blessed Beauty
not taught, ‘Consort with the followers of all religions’?49 Therefore, why
do you not associate with us?” He responded, “First tell me what
religion you follow, then we will associate with you!”

One day, this servant walked besides the blessed steed of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá from the Shrine of the Exalted One to the blessed House [of
Haifa]. Along the way, He spoke on certain matters. I mentioned the
above incident. He became very happy and smiled broadly. “Yes, indeed
it is so. It is revealed, ‘Consort with the followers of all religions except
the Covenant-breakers and hypocrites.’50”

49 The complete verse is, “Consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of
friendliness and fellowship;” (Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 21)
50 The present translator is not familiar with such a statement found in Bahá’u’lláh’s

Writings and it appears that it represented ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s interpretation. The word
munafiqín, meaning hypocrites, has Islamic roots and refers to those who were
outwardly with Muhammad, but disputed with His wishes. The following passage
from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 158)
further on the theme provided by the narrator: “O ye beloved of the Lord! The
Kingdom of God is founded upon equity and justice, and also upon mercy,
compassion, and kindness to every living soul. Strive ye then with all your heart to
treat compassionately all humankind – except for those who have some selfish,
private motive, or some disease of the soul. Kindness cannot be shown the tyrant,
the deceiver, or the thief, because, far from awakening them to the error of their
ways, it maketh them to continue in their perversity as before. No matter how much
kindliness ye may expend upon the liar, he will but lie the more, for he believeth you
to be deceived, while ye understand him but too well, and only remain silent out of
your extreme compassion.”

[The Guardian]
One day an illness had overcome the blessed person of the Guardian of
the Cause of God while in the blessed House of Haifa. When the
Greatest Holy Leaf – the Liege Lady of the people of Bahá – heard of
this, she rose from her seat and said, “I must go and see to the condition
of the blessed beauty.”51

The use of this appellation should not surprise the readers and
listeners, since the beauty of the Guardian of the Cause of God was the
same as the Blessed Beauty. He was the light of God and the nucleus of
refulgence of the Sun of Bahá’u’lláh. The point and purpose of the Liege
Lady of the people of Bahá was merely to make evident the station and
exaltation of the Guardian of the Cause of God through this statement.

[Remedy]
With her own blessed hands, the Greatest Holy Leaf used to prepare a
simple drop for eye ailments. To every ailing eye that this drop was
applied, it would be cured. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, “Khánum must
apply the drop with her own hands.” His blessed point was that the
reason for the cure was in her applying it [and not the drop].

If, for instance, a pregnant woman would attain the presence of
the Greatest Holy Leaf – the Liege Lady of the people of Bahá – out of
kindness and compassion, she would place her blessed hand on the
woman’s womb and smilingly would say whether the unborn child was a
boy or girl. Then she would suggest what name should be given. What
she predicted always occurred.

At times, out of benevolence and mercy, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would give
certain instructions to some that were sick, and [afterwards] perfect
health would be gained. However, the true cause of remedy and cure was
His blessed will.

My father had acquired a severe eye ailment. No medication
helped. One day, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came to our residence to inquire of his
health. My father was bedridden. After He observed the situation, twice
He said to him, “Close your eyes.” Then He moistened His fingers with
51   Jamál Mubarák, rendered as the Blessed Beauty, is a title used for Bahá’u’lláh.

His blessed mouth and rubbed it over my father’s eyes and said, “It is
nothing.” Not only his eyes gained perfect health, but also never again in
his entire life did he suffer from an eye ailment.

There was a certain inhabitant of ‘Akká whose name was ‘Abdu’l-
Mutallib, a son of a certain Mustafa-Dallál. He was devoted to ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. He acquired intense hiccups and no remedy was working. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá went to visit him in his home and to inquire of his health. He
noticed that hiccups would not let the man speak a word. He asked,
“Are there any apples here?” He was told, “It is not the season for
apples.” He said, “Someone should go to the House and search for one.”
An apple was found [in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s House] and brought to His
blessed presence. A corner of this apple had gone bad. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
instructed, “Eat the apple.” He ate a piece of the apple and his hiccup
subsided some. He continued eating the apple and his hiccup was
completely cured. He even started eating the apple core <p.80>, but
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to him, “There is no need to eat these.” However, he
ate it anyway, perhaps thinking that his cure was due to the apple. In
short, he was rescued from this intense ailment.

Such incidents would occur very often, each evidence of the might
and influence of His blessed Person. The Guardian of the Cause of God
used to say, “Whatever we have willed has occurred.” It is certain that
whatever the divine manifestations will, will occur since their will is
God’s will.

[Azal]
One night in ‘Akká we were all in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and He
was speaking of the unseemly deeds of Yahya Azal. In the course of His
description, He had to point to His index finger to demonstrate the
length and extent, and the story was as follows. He said, “One of Azal’s
sons had said that my father reveals verses and each word is this big.”
Smilingly He showed His index finger, meaning, the words are this long.

He related that Yahya Azal had said to the Blessed Beauty, “What
would we do if the true Qá’im appeared?” The Blessed Beauty had
smiled. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also smiled.

Even though the Satanic Tree has never taken root, nor will ever
do so, nevertheless this remark of his [Azal’s] was evidence of the falsity
of his claim and lack of convictions in the truth of the Blessed Beauty.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá would relate in essence, “Azal was most hairy. His
back was hairy like a bear.” In short, those that rose to extinguish the
perspicuous light, even their body was not without fault and defect.

After the honored Mishkín-Qalam, whose name is mentioned in
the history of the Cause, arrived in the Holy Land from the town in
Cyprus where Yahya Azal was residing, he related the following:

> One year there was no rain in Cyprus. People in that region
> were most disturbed. No matter how much they prayed,
> supplicated, visited various shrines, or engaged in entreaty in
> mosques and other places of worship, in hope that God
> would accept their appeal and open the gates of His Mercy
unto them, it bore no fruit.

At that time, Azal lived in a secluded room that had a
> high shelf. On this shelf, he had a bundle in which he kept a
> great quantity of papers, and had deep affinity towards these
> papers.52 I said to people who were praying [for rain], “If
> you want rain to come, at that location there is a bag full of
> papers containing many talismans. Bring down and burn
those papers, and immediately rain will descend.”

Immediately they hastened to that location [Azal’s
> apartment] and carried out my suggestion. No matter how
> much Azal cried and screamed, no one had paid any
attention to him.

At that moment, I turned my thoughts to the Blessed
> Beauty, and whispered, “O God, do not allow me to be
discredited. Manifest Thy power!”

Suddenly, a cloud with thunder and lightening
> appeared and filled the sky. So much rain poured that it
> nearly flooded.

52From the tone of the original, it appears that the bag contained Azal’s own
writings.

People were most thankful to me. They would say,
“We wish you had enlightened us sooner!”

[Mishkín-Qalam]
The honored Mishkín-Qalam was most humorous and clever. At one
time, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent him to Bombay53, but told him, “You will return
[to the Holy Land].”

While there, after some time, he became ill to the point that the
believers had lost hope for him to live through it. They even had
prepared the burial shroud and other necessities for his interment. When
he was at the door of death, the friends closed their shops and came
<p.85> to prepare for his burial.

At that time, the physician, out of desire for testing, suggested that
he be placed in a pool of hot water and massaged. As they were
massaging him, even though he was weak, with a very soft voice he
whispered, “Do not take your hand any lower; it will bite!” All that were
gathered burst into laughter and said, “He is not dying. Let us not waste
our time.” In short, he regained his health, and in perfect condition
returned to the Holy Land. The point is since ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had said to
him, “You will return,” then it was fulfilled.

After a long time, he passed away in ‘Akká in Khán Avamíd.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá came for the preparation of his burial. His burial place is in
the Bahá’í cemetery of ‘Akká.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “If Mishkín-Qalam did not have this wife,
then he would have lived a natural length of life.” From this blessed
utterance, it became evident that his wife was devoid of goodly
characters. That is, although she had passed away shortly before his
[Mishkín-Qalam’s] passing, nevertheless she had left undesirable effects
on him.

[On Life]

53 The name of the region is not perfectly readable and Bombay is the present
translator’s best guess.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, “Natural life is one-hundred twenty years. It can
be longer, but not shorter.”

The late Áqá Mírzá Áqá Khán Qá’im-Maqámí54 – upon him rest
God’s mercy and His paradise – used to say that when he was in the
presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, He had remarked, “A person may live for
one-hundred and fifty-five years, but not for one hour longer.”

[Bahiyyih Khánum’s Resting Place]
The Liege Lady of the people of Bahá went one day to visit the Bahá’í
Cemetery of Haifa. Later, in the presence of the Guardian of the Cause
of God, she stated, “I did not like it.” The point of her holiness was that,
after her passing, she did not wish her physical temple to be interred
there.

The Guardian of the Cause of God suggested the same location in
the vicinity of the Shrine of the Exalted One and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, which is
the eternal site of visitation of people of Bahá, and this suggestion
greatly pleased her sanctified person.

54He was a grandson of the renowned Abú’l-Qásim Qá’im-Maqám Faráhání, who
was mentioned by Bahá’u’lláh in the Kalimát-i Firdawsih. He was the first of Abú’l-
Qásim’s descendants to become a Bahá’í. For his biography see: Fádil Mázandarání,
Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 8, pp. 267-278. There are references to him also in
Taherzadeh, Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, vol. 4, pp. 222-26, and in Mehrdad Amanat,
Negotiating Identities: Iranian Jews, Muslims, and Baha’is in the Memoirs of Rayhan Rayhani
(1859-1939); PhD Dissertation; UCLA, 2006, p. 115: “Another critical account of
Baha’i efforts to convert Jews in Arak is significant in that it stresses the emotional
aspect, the Jews’ ‘ignorance’ and ‘simplemindedness,’ and divisions among Jewish
rabbis as contributing factors to the Baha’is’ success in attracting young Jewish
migrants. The description of Mirza Aqa Khan Qae’m-Maqam, an influential local
Baha’i landowner who offered an open invitation to his home and who personally
welcomed young Jewish migrants, echoes similar accounts of other Jews in Kashan
and Hamadan.” (Omid Ghaemmaghami, email communication, 23 November
2007\.)

[Sugar Shortage]
During World War [I], sugar-cubes could not be found, and most people
would drink their tea with raisin, or dry fig, or kharrub55 or its syrup, if
any of these could be found.

One day, a sugar loaf was presented to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He stated, “I
will not use it by myself.”

Next day, the believers in ‘Akká were summoned into His
presence in His house and He instructed that tea be served. The sugar
loaf was split, and each person received about the size of a sugar-cube.
Because of this kindness and generosity of His blessed Person, we were
all honored and thrilled. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “Place it to the left.” That is,
the left-hand side of the mouth. His blessed point was that on the left
side, unlike the right side, the sugar would not melt quickly. In truth, it
was as He indicated.

At all events, the conduct and deeds of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá were an
example to each person, so that we too would attain and be adorned
with such goodly and pure character and disposition.
55Better known as Kharnoub Tree in the Middle East, it is known as the Carob
Tree or Certatonia Siliqua in the West.

[Tea]
Regarding the preparation of tea, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, in essence,
“Tea must be brewed from one water.” That is, more water should not
be added.

> He would also say, “Tea is not harmed by one boiling.”
> In addition, “When tea is poured from the pot in a teacup for
testing, do not pour it back into the pot.” This blessed utterance was
only to preserve the fragrance and taste of the tea.

He would say, “Tea should not be poured into a saucer.56 If it is
hot, then one should wait a little for it to cool.” His point was that such
a practice is outside the bounds of cleanliness and delicacy.

[A Former Opponent]
There was a certain Hájí ‘Abbás in ‘Akká, originally from Baghdad. After
the Ascension of the Blessed Perfection, he joined the Covenant-
breakers and would conduct himself in accordance with the instructions
of the pivot of rebellion [Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí] and his followers. He
was ready and willing to slay ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, but the sovereignty of Truth
prevented him from carrying out his ill-intentions.

<p.90> During the final days of his life he had become old,
decrepit and ill.

When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá returned from His journeys to foreign
countries [in December 1913], he attained His blessed presence in one of
the streets of ‘Akká. In utmost humility and despondency, he submitted,
“I beg of You in the name of the Blessed Beauty to forgive me.”
‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “Come with Me.” He caressed his face and
added, “The past is past.”

Because he was handicapped, the Covenant-breakers had
previously agreed that each day they would bring his food to his house.
However, they were neglectful and when they brought some, it was not
much.
56In the east, it is not uncommon for tea to be poured from the teacup into a saucer
for it to cool, and then drunk from the saucer.

That day, when they [the violators of the Covenant] learned of his
return [to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s fold], they brought him a large basin of most
delicious food items. However, he completely refused, saying, “I have
nothing to do with you.” No matter how they pleaded and begged, it
bore no fruit. Helpless, they returned with the same food they had
brought – unsuccessful and failed.

Since he was ill, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá took him to Haifa, roomed in the
British hospital near the blessed House, and He would frequently visit
him. [On such visits,] He would offer gifts and money to others in the
hospital also. The believers would visit him [in the hospital] as well. This
servant visited him once also. From his face and appearance, it was
evident that from hell he had entered into paradise.

After a while, he passed away in the same hospital and left this
world with a good end.

The Covenant-breakers who sincerely would return [to the Faith],
and attain the sanctified presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, prostrate themselves
at His feet, kissing them, and cry and beg for forgiveness and pardon,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say to them, “The past is past,” and envelop them in
His kindness and mercy.

In truth, there is no pain or illness worse than violation of the
divine Covenant and Testament, since it brings darkness and is
suffocating. … “take refuge with God.”57

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Influence]
One of the friends of God was living in a village near ‘Akká, and over
the years had saved some capital through work and labor. He would lend
that money for interest to farmers in that region. However, they
schemed not to reimburse his principle. Of necessity, he mentioned the
situation to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

At that time, the deputy-governor was staying in that village to
attend to some governmental work. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, that essence of power
and might, wrote him a few words in this regard. Immediately upon the

57 In the copy of the manuscript used for the present translation, only a small
portion of the line at the bottom of page 92 was copied. Therefore, this sentence
represents the translator’s attempt at recovering a portion of that line.

receipt of this blessed communication, he arrested and imprisoned the
debtors and conditioned their release upon the full payment of their
debts. Because of this, they were compelled to repay immediately.

The inhabitants of that village said, “We did not know that ‘Abbás
Effendi has such influence and authority even outside of ‘Akká.”

One of the residents of ‘Akká was so distressed over the conduct
and deeds of his wife that he mentioned the situation in the presence of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, seeking a remedy. Consequently, his wife was summoned
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke to her words to this effect, “If you do not
change your behavior and conduct towards your husband, I will arrange
another wife for him.” It became evident that the purpose of the wife
had been to rob her husband of the confidence and ability to acquire
another wife.58 <p.95> However, the blessed remark [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
had made her plans transparent and made her change in such a way that
her husband expressed his satisfaction.

[Children’s Education]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was completely skilled and accomplished in swimming,
riding horses and shooting. He would say words to this effect, “Teach
children so that if it becomes necessary they will have the skills. They
should be accustomed to every food and bedding, so that if they
encounter difficulty and constraints, they would be able to endure the
situation.”

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Knowledge]

A young man in ‘Akká related to this servant, “Passing on a road, I
attained the presence of His Holiness ‘Abbás Effendi. He inquired,
‘Whose son are you?’ I mentioned my father’s name. His Holiness then
named my grandfather, my great grandfather and generation after
generation before them with such details and exposition that I was most
astonished and astounded.”

58It appears that a line at the bottom of page 94 was not photocopied in the
manuscript used for the present translation.

Indeed, to understand and comprehend the depth of that essence
of sanctity’s knowledge and perspicacity over all things in creation
depends on one’s faith and certitude, which is a matter that is clear and
evident before the people of Bahá; otherwise [one would remain] halted
and befuddled in the valley of wonderment and bewilderment.

[Impact of Deeds]
One day, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was at the pilgrim house adjacent to the blessed
Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. Several Bahá’í youth arrived and attained His
blessed presence. His spoke various exhortations and counsels, including
the essence of the following:

> Your fathers’ spirits in the next world are observant of your
> deeds. They become joyful and pleased with your goodly
> actions and behaviors, and sad and unhappy when it is
> otherwise.59

[Germany and Sangsar]
One night we were in His blessed presence in the blessed House of
Haifa. He spoke regarding the Bahá’ís of Germany. He stated, “Germany
means, Ál-mán.60 In constancy and firmness, they are like the Bahá’ís of
Iran.”

Regarding the believers of Sangsar, He remarked, “The Bahá’ís of
Sangsar are firm, constant, courageous and brave. They are Sang-Sar.”61

[The Guardianship]

59 Two lines are crossed and are completely unreadable at the top of page 97. It is
not clear if this was done by the author or by a later hand.
60 Ál-mán means our kin; this is a play on the word German in Persian. For a similar

recollection by Mu’ayyad, see, Eight Years Near ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: The Diary of Dr. Habíb
Mu’ayyad, (Trans. Ahang Rabbani).
61 A humorous play on words is intended. Sang is stone, and sar is head, and together

it means headstrong.

At times, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would speak in allusions about the Guardianship
of the Guardian of the Cause of God. Nevertheless, in those days [His
meaning] was beyond the power of comprehension and understanding
of the listeners, since such was necessary. However, after His blessed
passing, the meaning became evident and clear unto all.

One night we were all present in the blessed House of ‘Akká in the
presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The Guardian of the Cause of God was
present as well. [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] stated,

> After Me, the master of the Cause62, will firmly grasp the
> affairs [of the Faith]. Presently he is here as well.

No matter how deeply we thought about it, we could not
understand and discover His meaning since we could not see anyone
worthy of such a station. Therefore, we abandoned those thoughts in
consideration of the fact that we never imagined that the blessed
purpose of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was Shoghi Effendi Rabbani, who was in the
gathering with us.

From what I have heard, several individuals, like Hájí Mírzá
Haydar-‘Alí, had instinctively inhaled this musk-laden fragrance [i.e.
Shoghi Effendi’s future appointment], but were concealing it.

One day, the father of the Guardian of the Cause of God, the
honored Mírzá Hádí Afnán, was addressing him as Shoghi. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
stated, “Alas, I address him as Shoghi Effendi, and you call him Shoghi!”

One day this servant was in the company of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá from
the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh to ‘Akká. His steed was an excellent donkey.
When we arrived at ‘Akká, a carriage-driver had just arrived from Haifa,
bearing a missive from <p.100> the Guardian of the Cause of God,
which he had to present of His blessed Person [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. From
afar, as soon as his eyes fell upon His blessed Temple, he came running,
and when he reached His steed said, “This is a letter from Shoghi.”63
‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “Shoghi Effendi, Shoghi Effendi.” The man
repeated, “Shoghi Effendi.”

62   Lit. sáhib amr.
63   This sentence is in Arabic.

One day this servant, along with the late Áqá ‘Abdu’s-Samad, who
was an older brother of Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl Mansúr on his mother’s side,
attained the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the blessed House of Haifa. He
stated, “A letter has arrived for Me that is thoroughly confidential. Read
and return it forthwith.” He then dismissed us.

With utmost care, we read the letter in a secluded spot. We noted
that it was signed by the Guardian of the Cause of God, who in those
days was in a foreign land [England]. The entire content of that
supplication was about the exaltation of the Cause of God, the diffusion
of divine fragrances, formation of Assemblies, and the unity and
spirituality of friends of God in that region. There was nothing in the
letter that could be considered confidential. We then returned the
missive to His blessed presence.

However, after His ascension, it became clear and evident that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s purpose by the phrase “thoroughly confidential” was the
sanctified person of the Guardian of the Cause of God.

In short, each person, through certain hints and allusions, was
admonished and prepared [for Shoghi Effendi’s appointment].

[Jamáliyyih Khánum]
This servant had a paternal aunt by the name of Núríján, who was a
daughter of Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl Shahíd [martyred]. This aunt had a
daughter named, Jamáliyyih, who was a granddaughter of Áqá ‘Abdu’r-
Rasúl Shahíd. The Blessed Perfection had willed that Jamáliyyih Khánum
be in His service and she stood in attendance on that Promised Beauty.64

64 In interest of scholarly precision, it should be noted that the phrase here (p. 102,
line 4) is, bi khidmat ikhtiyár farmúdand. However, the words, bi khidmat appears to be
a later addition, and without it, the original may be understood to say, “had acquired
her as a wife.” When the original manuscript is made available to scholars, it should
be checked to see if bi khidmat was the author’s editing or by another hand. It should
be noted that the present translator knows of no evidence suggesting that
Bahá’u’lláh had married anyone other than Ásiyih Khánum, Mahd ‘Ulyá, and
Gawhar Khánum. This point is emphasized since certain opponents of the Faith
(e.g. ‘Abdu’l-Husayn Áyatí, known as Ávarih, and William Miller) have alleged that
Bahá’u’lláh had married this lady or have advanced other unfounded allegations.

The aforementioned Áqá ‘Abdu’s-Samad was a paternal cousin of this
servant and a brother of Jamáliyyih Khánum. Their father was a certain
Áqá ‘Alí and a native of Kashan.

A Tablet in honor of Jamáliyyih Khánum that positively describes
the situation was issued and revealed by the Supreme Pen. That Tablet is
thus:

He is the All-Knowing, the Wise.

> O Jamáliyyih, upon thee rest My Glory of God, My
bounties, and My favors.

I bear witness that thou didst attain My presence, and
> wast privileged to serve Me in the daytime and in the night
> season, in such wise that never wast thou overtaken by
> torpor in My service, nor prevented by any obstacle from
serving Me, nor from standing before My Countenance.

Rejoice thou at the testimony of My Most Exalted
> Pen, and say: “Glorified art Thou, O Lord my God! I ask
> Thee by Thy Most Great Name. Glorified art Thou, O Lord
> my God! I ask Thee by Thy Name whereby Thou hast
> subdued the kingdoms of earth and heaven, and made
> manifest the secrets of the realm of glory, to assist me to
> remain steadfast in Thy love, in Thy commemoration, and in
> Thy Cause. Thou, verily, art the All-Bountiful, the Most
Merciful.”

The Glory of Our presence rest upon thee, O My
> maidservant and My leaf,65 thou who circlest around Me at
> eventide and at dawn; and upon every maidservant who
> attaineth unto this Wondrous Cause, and who reverenceth
> thy station for the sake of God, the Almighty, the All-
> Praised.

The present translator knows no historical evidence in support of any of these
claims.
65 The term leaf is often reserved for Bahá’u’lláh’s female relatives (such as, His

wives or female descendants).

After the Blessed Beauty’s Ascension, Jamáliyyih Khánum had
said, “O God, grant me an ailment that I would have no sleep at night or
during the day.” The same thing occurred, and in that condition, she
passed away.66

After her passing, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “Jamáliyyih showed fidelity
to the Blessed Beauty.” Her resting place is in the Bahá’í cemetery in
‘Akká.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Residence]
Before ‘Abdu’l-Bahá journeyed to foreign countries, His principle
residence was in ‘Akká. However, in view of <p.105> the fact that the
blessed House [of ‘Abbúd] could not accommodate such a multitude,
nor provide for the comings and goings that were constantly taking place
before His blessed presence – such as visiting pilgrims, resident
believers, friends, strangers, authorities of the Ottoman government, the
‘ulamá, religious leaders, many who associated with or were related to
Him, servants and others – a large residence that was known as the
House of ‘Abdu’lláh Pashá became His residence, and offered comfort
and ease to all.

This house had an expansive courtyard, and every Friday all the
poor and destitute of ‘Akká, who constituted a large population, would
gather, and with His own hand and with utmost kindness and
compassion ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would bestow upon each one a sum of money.
This was the method and consistent way of His blessed person.

Through the efforts and intense spirituality of Ismá‘íl Áqá, the
faithful gardener of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, a garden and orchard was grown in
the courtyard of the house [of ‘Abdu’lláh Pashá]. It was most
enchanting, and would fill visitors with great delight.

On the side of the outer yard of the house was a spacious shelter
where the carriage of His blessed Person, with its horses and other
supplies, was kept. In those days, cars could not be found. The best

66 Most of this sentence is lightly crossed in the manuscript available to the present
translator and other words are written over it, which for the most part are
unreadable, but seem to indicate that Jamáliyyih Khánum suffered a period of illness
and depression before passing.

means for travel to the surrounding areas, or attending to various chores,
was by carriage, and even that was rare. Because of this, whenever the
nobles, religious leaders, officials of the Ottoman government, or
friends, wanted to go somewhere in that vicinity, they would ask ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá to allow them to use the carriage and the carriage-driver, Isfandiyár,
for the duration of their need.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá would sustain every form of hardship for the
protection and exaltation of the Cause of God, and to extinguish the fire
of sedition, enmity, jealousy and vengeance of the enemies at that time,
which was the height of violation of the Covenant, and to administer the
affairs of the people, whether friends or strangers.

[Husayn Áqá Tabrízí]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá even appointed a special coffee-brewer among the friends
whose name was Husayn Áqá Tabrízí. Whenever the ‘ulamá, clerics or
officials would attain His presence, in accordance with His blessed
instructions, he [Husayn Áqá] would prepare coffee, tea and a water-pipe
for the guests. He was very hard working even though he was an old
man. However, due to the intensity of his faith and certitude, he stood in
devoted service with his entire heart and soul. At the end, he passed
away in Haifa, and was submerged in God’s exalted mercy.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Speech]
When Turkish government officials from Istanbul would arrive and
attain the blessed presence [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], from the ease and
sweetness that He spoke Turkish they would be astonished,
wonderstruck and enchanted of that divine visage [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá].

When men of letters, the learned and scholars, either Arab or
otherwise, would arrive in His sanctified presence and that omnipotent
Master would commence speaking, they would be attracted beyond any
description or depiction to His mesmerizing utterances, and His
eloquence and fluency. Upon entering His blessed presence, they would
consider themselves deeply learned, and when leaving [would have come
to recognize themselves as] profoundly ignorant. The greatest scholars

would bow before Him and kiss His blessed hands, and in such instances
that essence of sanctity would always say, “Astaghfuru’lláh,
Astaghfuru’lláh!”67

[Nightly Gatherings]
In those days, every night a gathering would assemble, and in accordance
with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s instruction, a Qur’an reciter by the name of Shaykh
Yúnis, who was blind, would chant verses of Qur’an with hijází
intonation, and he would become the recipient of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
kindness. When a sufficient amount was recited, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say,
“Well done,” implying by this phrase that everyone’s spirit was
sufficiently elated. Afterwards, by His command, prayers would be
chanted. A non-Bahá’í who heard those prayers and Tablets once
exclaimed, “By God! These are Words of God!”

[Pilgrims]
In those days, rank upon rank of pilgrims <p.110> would arrive from
Iran and other places. The pilgrims who came from Iran were mostly
attired in the same manner and clothing that was current at the time of
the Qajar dynasty.

How often those pilgrims, out of sheer attraction, and
overwhelmed by faith, certitude, and love for the countenance of that
intended Beauty [‘Abdu’l-Bahá], would walk the entire long journey.
Upon attaining the threshold of that unquestioning Limit, out of fervor
and excitement that had filled their being, they would uncontrollably
throw themselves at His blessed feet and cry profusely, ennobling and
perfuming their faces by the dust of His magnificent feet.

Even though, out of the mercy and bounty of that compassionate
Master, the days of their attainments would be extended, nevertheless at
the time of departure the voice of their wailing and crying would be
raised heavenwards. That beloved of the world would try to calm those
souls until their sadness and grief was reduced, and at times they would

67   Literally “I ask God’s forgiveness,” or “God forbid!”

be honored with a Tablet revealed by the pen of the Center of the
Covenant and Testament.

‘Akká’s pilgrim house was in Khán Avamíd. Most days, pilgrims’
lunch and dinner was ábgúsht.68 One day ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came by the
pilgrim house and inquired of my uncle, Áqá Muhammad-Hasan, who
was the custodian of the pilgrim house, “Áqá Muhammad-Hasan, what
do you have for lunch?” He responded, “Ábgúsht.” He [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
stated, “Ábgúsht is a healthy meal. Therefore, I will be your guest
today.” It must be evident what joy and elation overcame the pilgrims
from learning that that day they would have lunch in the presence of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. “This did not [take place] save by His Bounties, the
Generous.”

In those days, a cloth was spread on ground for serving meals.

Either salad or yogurt accompanied lunch and dinner. In addition, sugary
halvah made with ground sesame seeds was at hand as well.

At all events, an unbounded and indescribable spirituality
enveloped everything. Night and day, all were engaged in speaking the
Truth. For sleeping, no special or designated spot was available, pilgrims
would assign each other’s place of rest, and with utmost spirit, fraternity,
joy and enchantment would all sleep in the same area. Some would sleep
in bags, and close them from inside, so they would be immune from the
bites of mosquitoes and fleas. Everyone rose early in the morning.

There was a parrot in the pilgrim house that every morning when
the pilgrims would come out of the room would greet them by “Alláh-u-
Abhá!”

There was also a parrot in the blessed House, that is, the House of
‘Abdu’lláh Pashá. One morning, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was pacing in the
courtyard and the parrot said, “Áqá!” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] responded, “Yes?”
The parrot said, “Say, ‘Yá Bahá’!69” Later, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to the
Greatest Holy Leaf, “Khánum, we were about to give away this parrot,
but he bought himself.”

In those days, Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí was in the pilgrim house,
and when anyone had a question about the Cause, would ask him.

ingredients such as potatoes, beans and dried lemon.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Dream]
Before ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s journey to foreign lands, one day Hájí Mírzá
Haydar-‘Alí was in the blessed presence. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to him, “Last
night, I had a dream,” and proceeded to describe the dream, in which
there were birds and fish. He then asked, “What is its meaning?” He
[Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí] stated, “Its interpretation resides with Your
blessed Self.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “Whoever dreams of bird or fish
will not die until he reaches sovereignty. Therefore, We will not die until
We reach sovereignty.” This was an allusion to the exaltation and
diffusion of the Cause of God.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Residence in ‘Akká]
In short, in the days nearing His blessed return <p.115> from foreign
countries, gradually, the house of ‘Abdu’lláh Pashá was emptied and all
movable furnishing was transferred to the blessed house in Haifa.

After His return, His residence then became the blessed house in
Haifa. Even though this house was available previously, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
primary residence was ‘Akká.

[Haifa’s Pilgrim House]
Previously a pilgrim house had been constructed near the Shrine of the
Báb. Áqá Mírzá Ja‘far [Hadioff] Shírází Rahmání70, who in those days
lived in ‘Ishqabad, had built this pilgrim house, but gradually, since he
did not have sufficient funds. When his money was depleted, he would
return to ‘Ishqabad and resume his trading business; when some savings
had been accumulated, he would return to Haifa [and continue
construction]. It went thus until the pilgrim house was completed.

70 Rahmání is written above the line and appears to be a later addition. Mírzá Ja‘far
Hadioff was originally from Shiraz, had migrated to ‘Ishqabad to take advantage of
freedom of movement and commence for Bahá’ís, and there was engaged in trading
tea. The surname Rahmání was bestowed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

In accordance with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s blessed instruction, an
inscription was installed above the pilgrim house that read, “This is a
spiritual pilgrim house and has been raised by Áqá Mírzá Ja‘far Shírází
Rahmání.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say words to this effect, “If Áqá Mírzá Ja‘far
had not built this pilgrim house, his capital would have been wasted in
‘Ishqabad. Now no matter how much this pilgrim house is expanded, it
will remain in his name.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá by the Shrine of the Báb

[Payment of Huqúqu’lláh]
There was a certain Mírzá Abú’l-Hasan in Egypt that became owner of a
parcel of land. Oil was found in that land, and for this reason, he became
exceedingly wealthy and affluent. He asked ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “Excuse me
from payment of Huqúqu’lláh, because if I was to pay the Huqúq, I

would need to appoint a special clerk.” It was not long before his entire
wealth disappeared, and then he died.

In his entire life, he had only contributed a candelabrum to the
Shrine of the Exalted One [the Báb], and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had stated, “This
is what has been left for him.”

[Visit to ‘Akká]
At all events, after that [post-1914], whenever ‘Abdu’l-Bahá visited
‘Akká, the days of His stay would be either at the blessed house [of
‘Abbúd] or in the pilgrim house next to the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. After
the intervention71 of the British government, that previous situation, as
described earlier, did not continue.

At the time of the arrival of that government’s army and military
to Haifa and ‘Akká, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “The ship of the Cause has
reached the shore of safety.” His purpose was that the plundering hand
of the enemies of the Cause and the hate-filled Covenant-breakers was
now arrested from committing any damage or harm, and no protection,
assistance or supporter remained for them.

In ‘Akká a Christian attained His blessed presence and said, “I met
you in America.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “All people have questions
for us, except inhabitants of ‘Akká. We have left ‘Akká to its
inhabitants.”72 This comment was made to this person in consideration
of the fact that he had seen both the excitement and exhilaration of the
people of that region [America, by meeting ‘Abdul-Bahá], and the
coldness and indifference of the people of ‘Akká [towards the Faith].

[Visiting the Mosque]
Like before [His trip to the west], ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would visit the mosque
on Fridays, and after offering His obligatory prayers, would give alms to
the poor.

replaced with mudákhilih, meaning intervention. The later editing appeared more
accurate and was adopted for the present translation.
72 The narrator provides this statement in both Arabic and its translation in Persian.

There was only one mosque in Haifa, named Jámi‘ al-Súq – that is,
the bazaar mosque. However, later another mosque was built near the
train station. Some residents used to say, “His Holiness ‘Abbás Effendi
had said that one <p.120> mosque is insufficient for Haifa, and He
contributed substantially towards construction of this other mosque.”

[The Future of Haifa and ‘Akká]
At all events, every movement and deed of His blessed person was solely
for the sake of the protection and safety of the Cause of God, and the
security and sheltering of [Bahá’í] sacred places from the harm of the
enemies and ill-wishers.

Haifa in 1910s

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say to this effect, “There is a water
wellspring in the land surrounding the Shrine of the Exalted One [the
Báb], but it is untimely to disclose it, and it must remain hidden until its
time.” From this blessed utterance, it was evident that once that

wellspring came to the surface, what immense beauty and splendor
would encircle the Shrine of the Exalted One.73

He used to state, “Mount Carmel will be all enveloped in light.”
He would add to this effect:

> At dawn, with wondrous and melodious voices, they will be
engaged in the mention of God.

Ships carrying the flag of “Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá!” will
> anchor at the port [of Haifa] and kings will disembark. On
> foot and bareheaded, and with humility and modesty, and in
> a state of supplication and entreaty, chanting divine verses
> and prayers, they will attain to a visit of the Shrine of the
> Exalted One [the Báb]. On the path to the Shrine of the
> Exalted One, there will be pools of water, gardens and
places for rest and respite.

Afterwards, with bouquets of flowers over their
> shoulders, and while reciting divine verses and prayers, they
will visit the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh.

At that time, after the bay is drained, a straight avenue
> will be constructed connecting the Shrine of the Exalted
One [the Báb] to the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh.

However, we will see all of this from the Malakút [the
Kingdom of God].

One day at the Shrine of the Exalted One, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke on
this theme, and also said, “I see these things now, but you do not see.
My presence is a hindrance. Later, the Cause will grow.” From this
73According to Fariborz Sahba (private communications, 5 March 2008), one of the
challenges faced by the project team building the Terraces around the Shrine of the
Báb was the irrigation of gardens, especially under the tight water regulations in
Haifa. It so happened that the above statement of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was brought to
Sahba’s attention and with the help of local water consultants and geologists, the
source of water was located in 2000. This underground water reservoir appears to
have been created because of an earthquake fault that crosses the terrain of Mount
Carmel. The project team then managed to negotiate and convince the authorities to
make an exception and allow that water to be used solely for the gardens around the
Shrine, thus fulfilling ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s prediction.

blessed utterance, it was evident that people are more inclined to the
unseen than the seen. It is because they consider the Temple of the
Cause as one like themselves.

[Tiberius]
At times, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would journey to Tiberius. [One time,] the Qádí
[judge] of Haifa sent a missive to His blessed presence inquiring of the
condition of Tiberius. In the course of responding to this supplication,
He stated, “If you ask about Tiberius, know that its stones are black, its
inhabitants are Jewish and their appearance is basic.”74 It is likely that he
[the Qádí] had wanted ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to invite him there, so he had been
honored with this response.

One day in Tiberius, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was pacing by the shores of the
Dead Sea.75 Khusraw was also in His blessed presence. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
stated, “It was here that Peter fished.” While He was speaking these
words, suddenly a large fish threw himself from the sea and landed
before His blessed feet. He said, “Come Khusraw, take it, as our daily
sustenance has arrived.”

[Confirmations]
In the days of the Blessed Perfection, exalted and magnified be His
mention, a native of ‘Akká had invited a group to lunch beneath the
spruce-fir trees situated across from the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, which was
a most pleasant spot. However, at lunchtime, additional people arrived
who had not been invited. The host was deeply perturbed how to feed
anyone with the [limited] food that he had prepared. Of necessity, he had
gone into the Mansion [of Bahjí] and attained the presence of the
Blessed Beauty, inquiring about a remedy for his problem. That Author
of bounties and blessings had said, “The Master should go and with His

74 The narrator gives this statement in both original Arabic and translation in
Persian. Translation of the final phrase is not precise.
75 Most likely, Bahr Miyat [Dead Sea] was a slip of pen and the Sea of Galilee was

meant.

own hand serve the food.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá …76 had served the food,
<p.125> and not only was it sufficient unto everyone, but an excess
amount was left.

The late Áqá Jamál was a cook in the blessed house, and was
known as Abú-Sabrí. For a while, he helped my paternal uncle, Áqá
Muhammad-Hasan Khádim, in the pilgrim house of the Shrine of the
exalted One and was of service in that place. He related:

> One day, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was in the pilgrim house [of Haifa].
> Food was prepared for several of pilgrims and guests.
> However, at lunchtime, an [unexpected] group of pilgrims
> arrived. Since the prepared food was insufficient, a lesser
> quantity was placed in each dish and plate. Suddenly,
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came into the kitchen and said, “Jamál, what
are you doing? Fill the plates.”

I did as bidden, filled the plates, and served them to
> everyone. I observed that the food was most sufficient for
all.

Later, He summoned me and said to the effect, “It
> had passed noon and everyone was hungry. When food is
> served in small portions, even if a second helping is offered,
> it will not satisfy. But when it is given in sufficient quantity,
> then the eye is satisfied.” His blessed intent was that first the
> eye must be satisfied for the stomach to feel the same way.

[On Caution]
One night there was a gathering at the blessed house of ‘Akká and in
midst of it, the gardener of the Bágh [Garden] Firdaws arrived. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá inquired, “Who is at the Bágh?” He said, “No one is there.”
‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “Incidents happen suddenly. Caution should
never be abandoned.”

[Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl]
76   Half a line at the bottom of page 124 was not copied in the present manuscript.

One day, along with my paternal uncle, Áqá Muhammad-Hasan, we
attained the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá outside the outer gate of the
blessed House in Haifa. In the course of his utterances, He stated, “If
five persons like Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl could be found, I would prostrate
Myself on the ground.”

When the Kitáb Fará’id was printed and brought before His blessed
presence, He kissed the book.

After he had been submerged in God’s mercy [i.e. passed away],
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “He was an amazing man. He was aware of all
things.”

During the height of revolt of the Covenant-breakers, Mírzá
Abú’l-Fadl would go the Mansion of Bahjí and meet with the pivot of
rebellion, perchance he could make him repent [his opposition]. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá inquired, “Why do you go visit Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí (the arch-
Covenant-breaker)?” He responded, “Your Excellency, was His Holiness
the Exalted One [the Báb] the true One or was He not?” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
said, “He was the true One.” Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl then said, “If You say
that He was not, I will accept.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá then remained silent.
Through this exchange, Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl established the depth of his
faith, certitude, constancy and firmness in the divine Covenant and
Testament.

One time, during the days and pilgrimage of Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl77,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to him to the effect, “If I were in your place, I would
go to Egypt and engage in teaching and educating students in the
Qur’an.” From this comment, Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl grew reflective. [Seeing
his silence and condition, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] stated, “It is not too late. You
can do so now.” It was because of this that in accordance with the
blessed instruction, he transferred his residence to Egypt and succeeded
in immensely mighty services.

In truth, he was a proof unto the Cause. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say,
“Even the very water that Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl drank was to give him the
strength to write [in support of the Faith]”.

One night an assemblage was meeting in the blessed house of
Haifa and the Guardian of the Cause of God said to the effect, “If Mírzá
Abú’l-Fadl were here, he would adduce from the [Sacred] books.” From
77   This phrase appears to be a later addition to the manuscript.

this blessed utterance it was understood that in much the same way as
the previous events [of the Cause] had been in accordance with firm
texts and prophecies of heavenly books [of the past], the present
occurrences related to the Guardianship were likewise mentioned and
ascribed in the celestial books, requiring interpretation by those endowed
with knowledge and the learned in Bahá, since nothing in the divine
unfoldment is by accident.

[Good Citizenship]
My father used to relate that the Blessed Beauty had said, “When you
assume residence in a house, do not worsen nor improve it.” From this
utterance of the Truth it was evident that destruction and change were
beneath the station of man, nor were they acceptable unto God or
mankind.

Indeed, Bahá’u’lláh had also advised, “When you leave a dwelling,
it must be cleaned before returning it to its owner. However, it must be
no worse and no better than the original. Otherwise, the owner will
become greedy and this will cause difficulties.”

It so happened that <p.130> this servant rented a dwelling that
consisted of one room. However, to improve its condition, after
receiving permission [from the owner] I installed some shelves. Even
though the owner was a Bahá’í, he increased the rent. At the end, I was
forced to return it to him in the original state. Even though it brought
him no benefit, this caused me difficulty and loss.

[Siyyid Mihdí Dahají]
There was a certain Siyyid Mihdí from Dahaj. At the beginning of the
Cause, he was among the renowned teachers of the Faith. However, due
to his unjustified expectations, in his latter days he joined hands with the
Covenant-breakers and used to write letters to various people in hope
that, like the foolish ones of this day,78 he would derail souls from the
straight path of God. The friends of God would send responses to his
letters first to blessed presence [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], and then these would
78   Most likely a reference to Jamshíd Ma‘ání, mentioned later in this narrative.

reach him. Beneath one of the responses to him, the following poem was
penned [by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]:

The bounty of God will tolerate for some time,

But when the limit is surpassed, it will defame.

At last, with great regret and remorse, he sank to the lowest abyss
of hell.79

This egotistical man had two dimwitted and unintelligent sons:
Husayn and Hasan. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to relate to this effect, “When
speaking with Me, Siyyid Mihdí would greatly extol and praise Hasan’s
astuteness, saying that the lad was most intelligent. There was a herd of
goats at Bahjí. [While playing,] each of the Bahá’í kids was holding the
udder of one of the goats, imbibing their milk. However, he [Hasan] was
holding a male goat, imbibing it, and saying, ‘This is salty.’” When telling
this story He would laugh heartily.80

Siyyid Mihdí had amassed a substantial sum. A Jewish man enticed
him and for this reason, he had given him his entire capital, which he
embezzled, and decided that escaping was the preferred route.

Sanctified is God! Whoever rose to oppose or harm the Center of
God’s Covenant and Testament was seized in the grasp of all manners of
divine chastisement.
79 Siyyid Mihdí was a learned man and a capable promoter of the Faith. Bahá’u’lláh
had conferred the title of Ismu’lláhu’l-Mihdí (the Name of God Mihdí) on him and
had revealed a number of Tablets in his honor. He was a native of Dahaj in the
province of Yazd, visited Bahá’u’lláh in Baghdad, Edirne, and ‘Akká, and had
received much attention. Siyyid Mihdí traveled widely throughout Iran and was
greatly loved by the Bahá’ís. From a description left by Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí, it
appears that Siyyid Mihdí considered himself above other believers, an image that he
tried to promote through various means.
80 According to Fádil Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 8, part 2, pp. 900-901,

the reason that Siyyid Mihdí Dahají was extolling his sons to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was that
he wanted Husayn to marry Munavvar Khánum, one of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s daughters. It
was when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refused this and married them to people whom Siyyid
Mihdí considered his inferiors that Siyyid Mihdí went over to Mírzá Muhammad-
‘Alí’s side in about 1909 and was declared a Covenant-Breaker. From this account,
one can see that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had good reason to refuse the marriage. (Based on
Moojan Momen’s posting on Tarikh discussion group, 4 March 2008).

‘Abdu’l-Bahá would also tell that he [Siyyid Mihdí] had written píáz
with a dhál.81 He would tell this story with a resonant accent and smile.

> His sons [Husayn and Hasan] died in misery and deprivation.

At one time, some of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s verses and blessed Tablets in
Arabic had reached one of the Covenant-breakers. Since he wanted to
imply that he had knowledge and learning, he had said, “Its
vowelizations are correct.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would tell this story and smile.

In truth, when a person turns away from God, even his mental
faculties and senses are impaired.82

[The Narrator’s Family]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, “A good wife is like paradise unto a man and a
bad one is like hell.”

It was two years after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ascension that this servant
married. From this union, we had eleven children: seven boys and four
girls. Their names, in order, were: Jamílih, Jamíl, Nadím, Labíb, Nabíhih,
Na‘ím, Ruhiyyih, Amín, Bashír, Samír, and Fá’izih. The names of these
children have been given in their chronological order. Out of her grace
and bounty, the Greatest Holy Leaf, the Liege Lady of the people of
Bahá, granted the names of these children through the fifth child, that is,
Nabíhih, <p.135> thereby bestowing this honor upon them.

However, Jamílih and Jamíl were names bestowed by the Blessed
Beauty on a sister and a brother of this servant. Since both had passed
away, the Liege Lady of the people of Bahá willed that these two names,
which had streamed from the lips of the Merciful [Bahá’u’lláh], be once
again returned to this family. Therefore, from two directions these
names are a source of honor unto them. That is, in addition to the
sovereign will of the Greatest Holy Leaf – may my life be a sacrifice unto
her kindness and her bounties – the tongue of the Beauty and of the

81Píáz means onion and is written with ze.
82Most of page 133 was left blank or was erased in the copy of the manuscript
available to the translator.

Grandeur [Bahá’u’lláh] also uttered these two names. God willing, may
they be jamílih and jamíl in every way.83

Similarly, may their brothers and sisters also be known by the
beauteous attributes given to them as names, and may they remain
successful and confirmed under the shadow of God’s Universal House
of Justice, which is the authority and refuge of the people of Bahá.
Today, this is indeed the path of righteousness, and eternal glory, and all
else is evident loss.

My wife’s name is Zaynab. She is the daughter of Sa‘íd Ghaffír;
and her mother’s name was also Zaynab. They were of the believers of
Damascus, Syria. In those days, she was studying at the College of
Beirut. Since her parents had passed away, her maternal uncle, Áqá
‘Abdu’r-Razzaq Rúmání, had raised her.

At that time, this servant journeyed from ‘Akká to Beirut [and met
Zaynab] and since it was the divine decree [for us to eventually marry],
the consent of the two of us and parents were conditioned upon the
approval and good-pleasure of the Liege Lady of the people of Bahá,
who at that time was residing in Haifa. After inquiring, an affirmative
response and complete consent was bestowed [by Bahiyyih Khánum].

Therefore, from Beirut we proceeded directly to Haifa and arrived
at the blessed House [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. Upon arrival, we learned that
[Bahiyyih] Khánum had gone to ‘Akká. As such, this servant, without
halting in Haifa, proceeded forthwith to ‘Akká.

That very day, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s daughter and my bride-to-be arrived
in the blessed House of [‘Abbúd in] ‘Akká, which, as mentioned
previously, had been our abode and place of residence in accordance
with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s blessed instructions. It must be evident that in the
presence of the Greatest Holy Leaf what exceeding gladness enveloped
us!

In short, three days after our arrival, in accordance with traditions,
law and wisdom, first Qur’anic [i.e. Islamic] marriage vows were taken
and after that, in accordance with the command of the Liege Lady of the
people of Bahá to my paternal uncle, Áqá Muhammad-Hasan, the
Bayánic marriage took place.
83Jamílih and jamíl are feminine and masculine versions of the same attribute,
meaning beautiful, handsome, reputable, or good.

The morning of that day, [Bahiyyih] Khánum and the daughters of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá decided to return to Haifa. At the time of leaving the
House, she remarked to this servant, “Groom, may God watch over
you!” This evanescent one had no words save bowing, humility and
submission. In truth, it was a most undeserved bequest upon this
servant.

At all events, these children, that is, Jamílih, Jamíl, Nadím and
Labíb, were born in the blessed House [of ‘Abbúd] – a bounty that
hereafter will not visit upon anyone else, especially since it occurred in
the blessed days of the Greatest Holy Leaf. That is, never again until the
end of time will the eye of creation witness such a remnant and vestige
[of the Holy Tree, like Bahiyyih Khánum].

[Revising Traditions]
At the request of their parents, the newly born children of the friends of
God were named by ‘Abdul-Bahá, the Center of the Divine Covenant
and Testament. After the ascension of His blessed Person, the friends
would ask the Greatest Holy Leaf [to name their newborn]. However,
after the ascension of the Liege Lady of the people of Bahá, the
Guardian of the Cause of God stated, “Henceforth, parents should name
their own children.” His purpose was that the friends of God should not
bring this request to his blessed presence, since, firstly, it was a waste of
his precious time and, secondly, the will of his blessed person had
decreed in this regard not to follow the example [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá].84

For instance, whenever He wanted to express <p.140> His special
bounty and benevolence, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would always say, “Marhabá!”
The Guardian of the Cause of God completely withheld himself from
uttering that phrase.

When the friends, either privately or in a gathering, attained the
presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, He would say at the end, “Fí amánu’lláh!”85

84 The present translator recalls with fondness that this tradition was followed
during the tenure of ‘Ali Nakhjavani on the Universal House of Justice, when he
would often suggest names for newborns, including a name for the translator’s
younger son, Tebyan.
85 Lit, Be under God’s protection.

However, the beloved Guardian of the Cause of God would stand up
and leave the room.

He [Shoghi Effendi] was most attentive in his observance of such
[separate] stations. Therefore, he did not approve of such practices [as
naming newborns] that had been practiced in the past, so that his
servitude unto the Threshold86 would be made manifest in every way.

The beloved friends of God who in the days of the Blessed
perfection – exalted be His mighty mention – had attained to the Visage
of God [Bahá’u’lláh], and also had attained to the presence of the Center
of Divine Covenant and Testament, would say that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, from
the perspective of might, grandeur, splendor, conduct and exposition,
was identical to the Blessed Beauty; except in the presence of that
Promised Beauty, He was the very manifestation of servitude.

In consideration of the fact that this servant witnessed and
attained the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the Guardian of the Cause
of God, I also beheld the same might, grandeur and dignity of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá in the sacred being of the Guardian.

It is evident that since they all are representative of the Truth, then
they are one reality, and no difference is seen in their essence except
whatever difference that might exist due to their station and rank.

[Simple Expositions]
One night a gathering was held in the blessed House of Haifa. For an
occasion, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “The Persian language is not so easy.”

Whenever plain souls like this lowly one were present, that essence
of kindness and compassion would speak with simple and common
words, so that all would understand His remarks. On the other hand, if a
translator was involved, He [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] would be considerate of him
so that he would be able to carry out his charge.

[Proving the Truth of Islam]

86The author evokes Shoghi Effendi’s well-known signature on his correspondence
with the East, which read, Bandih ástánash, Shoghi [the servant of His Threshold,
Shoghi].

One day during the time of the Ottoman government, several Muslim
‘ulamá were in a gathering in Jámi‘ Jazzár [the mosque of al-Jazzár] with
the mutisarrif, who was the governor of the region. At that assemblage, a
Christian priest also arrived. Soon discussions with that priest turned to
religion and the proof of the truth of the Messenger of God
[Muhammad]. However, the ‘ulamá discovered themselves unable and
powerless at presenting sufficient proofs and establishing the truth [of
Prophet Muhammad] in response to arguments and questions posed by
the priest.

When the mutisarrif witnessed the situation to be as such, he
became deeply perturbed. He summoned his attendant and whispered to
him, “Go to the presence of His Holiness ‘Abbás Effendi and say that
the mutisarrif is requesting Him to come forthwith.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá consented and arrived at the gathering, and saw the
situation. In order that no one would suspect that he had instigated
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s attendance, after the customary greetings and expressions
of humility, the mutisarrif stated, “What an auspicious hour have we
attained the presence of Your Holiness, since a religious discussion is
taking place here.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “Very well. We will listen too.”

However, the actual discussion was in Arabic and what is written
here [in Persian] is a summary of the events.

Gradually, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá assumed the thread of conversation from
them [the ‘ulamá] and began to directly speak with the priest. Soon, His
blessed utterances were surging forth, to the point that he [the priest]
confessed and acknowledged the truth of the Messenger of God
[Muhammad].

However, he stated, “We [the Christians] are like inhabitants of a
village, who are used to dwelling in the village and unaccustomed and
unwilling to live in the city.” He likened the Religion of Christ to a
village and the Dispensation of Muhammad to a city.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “If in the days of Christ a Jew had said
such a thing in His presence, would He have accepted?”

The priest said, “No.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, <p.145> “I do not accept it from you
either.”87

After this penetrating response and the silence of the priest, all
present in that assembly were exceedingly happy.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Guidance]
During the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, whenever a person had a
problem or a difficulty and presented it to Him in hope of guidance,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá would state whatever was most effective and conducive for
[resolving] his situation. Moreover, when that person acted according [to
the given guidance], then he would arrive at a complete resolution.

At times, certain thoughts would occur to the person seeking
guidance, and he would imagine that those avenues might support better
results; when he presented those [alternative] ideas, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would
say, “Very well.” Afterwards though, [from the implementation of the
person’s own idea], opposite results [from those which were desired]
would be gained. And when this reached the ears of His blessed Person,
He would say, “His welfare was in the first suggestion.” That is, if the
individual had acted according to the guidance that He had first offered,
then he would have been successful.

How happy is a person who, faced with divine advice, is in a state
of utter resignation, and has no thoughts or will of his own!

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Humor]
Some men with a mustache like to twist their mustache. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
used to say, “Whoever twists his mustache is sullen.”88

For the enjoyment of those in His presence, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at times
would employ a little humor, which delighted His listeners.

There was a certain Khajih Nasíf in ‘Akká, who was Christian and
the owner of the pilgrim house next to the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh.

87 The narrator gives the last exchange in both original Arabic and its translation in
Persian.
88 It is likely that this statement was a reference to Western missionaries, who were

often dry in their demeanor.

Previously, he would come and go in the blessed House [of ‘Abbúd], and
had learned a few Persian words. He had married a Christian woman,
thoroughly devoid of beauty. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “I asked him,
‘What do you do with her?’ And he responded, ‘I turn off the light.’”
‘Abdu’l-Bahá would then smile.

There was a certain Shaykh ‘Alí in ‘Akká, who had become a
believer in his native town of Kashan. He was half-cleric, but a very
simple man. He worked as a barber. He also had two donkeys, which he
used to rent out for extra income.

On this pretext [of renting the animals], someone took away the
donkeys, with no intention of returning them. He mentioned the
situation to His blessed Person and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded [in humor],
“O Shaykh, donkeys are gone, donkeys are gone, donkeys are gone!”

> He [Shaykh ‘Alí] had a wife, who was from Kashan.

In those days, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s residence was in the House of
‘Abdu’lláh Pashá. When the [nightly] gathering was held, the Shaykh said,
“Last night I dreamt that I was riding my [lost] donkey.” And he
described some details.

There was a certain Áqá Faraj from Isfahan, who was most witty.

He was at the gathering also. Even though he was in excess of ninety
years of age, if someone said to him that he was old or decrepit, he
would become very agitated.

One day, for the sake of humor, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked him, “Áqá
Faraj, are you older or I?” He said, “Master, the whole world testifies to
your greatness – both inwardly and outwardly!”

When the Shaykh [‘Alí] was waiting to hear an interpretation of his
dream, Áqá Faraj said to him, “Even in the mosquito net you were riding
your donkey?” When he spoke this banter, particularly in the presence of
His blessed Person, such laughter overcame those in attendance that in
order to give everyone space for enjoyment, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá immediately
left the room.

In short, this was the only interpretation of his dream that he
heard.

[Bahá’u’lláh’s Influence]

One night there was a gathering in the blessed House of ‘Akká, and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá shared the essence of the following:

> There was a Kurdish person who was deeply devoted to the
Blessed Beauty, and used to attain His sacred presence.

One day, [Bahá’u’lláh] inquired of his health and
> wellbeing. He said, “I have a problem, but I am ashamed to
mention it.” He responded, “Do not be embarrassed; say it.”

It became evident that he was in love with the
> daughter of a certain Pashá, but [given his humble
> circumstances] marriage with her was impossible.
> Nevertheless, the Blessed Beauty arranged a solution [and
the marriage took place].

After a while, <p.150> a missive arrived from him,
> saying, “My wife has given birth to a child and I request a
> name for him.”89

In sharing this story, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was smiling. His purpose was
to illustrate the sovereignty and influence of the Blessed Beauty under all
circumstances.90

[Old Traditions]
One day, several prominent men of Islam were in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
presence in ‘Akká.91 One of them asked for water, but drank only a
mouthful from the water in the cup. Another of them said to him, “Do
you not know that there is a hadith92 that states water must be drunk in
three mouthfuls?”

89 The words of the Kurdish man are given in what appears to be a Kurdish dialect.
90 A similar story is attributed to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in: “Told by Abdu’l Bahá: From
Diary of Mirza Ahmad Sohrab”, July 3, 1914, Star of the West, Vol. 9, p. 212-214.
However, in this story it is Jesus who grants a similar wish to a poor man.
91 The phrase in ‘Akká seems to be a later addition.
92 Often translated as traditions, it is a vast collection of sayings of the Prophet

Muhammad and the Imams, often being of highly questionable provenance.

His blessed Person shared this story in our assembly and smilingly
added, “And he responded, ‘This is the first mouthful.’”

Many of the traditions and practices which were not worthy of
direct discussion, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would elucidate them through humor or
stories, and thereby edify and educate.

[On Marriage]
Regarding marriage and its prerequisites, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to speak the
following exact words, “Man must be godly and be able to earn a
livelihood for his family and himself.”

This brief utterance, issued and spoken by the lips of His
sovereign will, is most precious before those endowed with knowledge
and is filled with wisdom, since it is a principle point and everything else
is secondary. Therefore, the happiness sought in marriage by the
daughters of the faithful is under the shadow of this principle and
nothing else.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “The least of the friends is better than the
fairest of the nonbelievers.”

Moreover, He used to say, “The worst of the friends is better than
the best of the nonbelievers.”

These blessed utterances were solely for guidance, happiness and
ease of the people of Bahá. Blessed is the one who followed [Him] and
adhered [to the Faith].

[A Dream]
There was a person in the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá who lived in
‘Akká and used to attain His blessed presence. One day, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
was speaking of the influence of dreams and visions. This man said, “I
do not believe in dreams.” He responded, “Very well. Let’s wait till you
come to believe.”

After a while, this man had to journey to Haifa. While there, he
dreamt that a messenger had come from ‘Akká bearing a letter in his
name. When he opened the enveloped, he noticed that it was written,
“Your daughter has died, but she has not had her funeral procession.

Come quickly.” [In this dream,] he returned forthwith to ‘Akká and
when he arrived, he saw a coffin in the house’s courtyard containing his
daughter. A large multitude had gathered for the funeral, waiting for his
arrival. Afterwards, the funeral took place.

He woke up from this dream. That very morning, the same details
that he had dreamt – no more and no less – occurred. Afterwards, he
came into the blessed presence [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], and had said, “I have
come to believe in dreams; however, I did not expect that it would be in
such a way.” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] responded, “Such was the divine decree.”

[Payment of Debt]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá would speak considerably regarding payment of debts. For
instance, He would state in effect, “There was a person in debt who
owed money, but his income was insignificant. Nevertheless, he had set
aside a portion of his income for the payment of this debt and gradually
was reimbursing what he owed. After a while, he observed that his entire
debt was paid and his obligations were fulfilled.” This utterance of His
blessed Person was both praise and a lesson.

[Messengerhood]
One day this servant was in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Haifa.
Suddenly and without a previous reference, He said, “Messengerhood
means to convey a message.”

It appeared that the meaning of this word <p.155> was unclear to
some and His blessed will had decreed that it be made clear and evident.

[Ladies Attire]
One day a Turkish woman from Istanbul arrived at the blessed House of
Haifa. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá greatly praised her attire and the manner of her
clothing. This was because at that time, the Muslim women who dwelled
in the cities would go outside the house wearing a chador and a face
covering. However, that woman from Istanbul had only covered her hair
under a scarf, and her dress covered her up to the neck, and had long

sleeves and was ankle-length. Therefore, with great joy, [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
said, “This is the meaning of ‘modesty.’93”

[On Marriage]
One time, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá observed that a husband and wife among the
pilgrims had utmost affection for one another during their entire stay,
and consulted with each other on every subject. In seeing this, He stated,
“This is an example of being a husband and wife.”

There was a certain Hájí ‘Alí from Yazd who was among the early
believers in the Cause. He was ninety years old. He would relate that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá had said about marriage, “This connection was decreed
prior to creation.” From this utterance, it was understood that marriage
and union is dependent on God’s will and divine dictate.94

[Children’s Spiritual Education]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to rise early morning before sunrise and wake up the
household. Sometimes He would go to the rooftop and engage in prayer
and meditation. Afterwards, He would proceed to the room of His
illustrious sister, the Greatest Holy Leaf, which was the gathering place
[of the family] and the morning tea. Then the family of God and His
household would all come together, and the children, at ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
bidding, would recite prayers. Tea would be served. He used to say, “Do
not give tea to children, and if you do, make it light.”

He asked one of His grandchildren, “Where is your heart?”95 The
latter placed his hand on his stomach and said, “Here.” He stated, “That

93 The word hijáb is typically rendered as veil, but in this context, it is understood by
the translator to mean modesty.
94 On a number of occasions, Abú’l-Qásim Afnán related to the present translator

that the Hand of the Cause of God Tarázu’lláh Samandarí had shared with him that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá had said to him directly that three things are out of man’s control and
were decreed before time by God, as they have to do with the world above:
marriage, pilgrimage and death.
95 While the original dil is always translated as heart, in Persian parlance it means

stomach.

is your abdomen.” His purpose was merely to correct this common
mistake made by some souls.

In a gathering that was held in a small room with many in
attendance, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “The youngsters should give their seats
to adults.”

In short, all His blessed utterances, whether personal or
communal, were based on wisdom, intended to guide, edify and educate,
bringing about righteousness in each soul.

[Spiritual Assemblies]
One day a group of the friends of God were gathered in the pilgrim
house of the Shrine of the Exalted One for the purpose of visiting [the
Shrine of the Báb], and they were in the presence of the Guardian of the
Cause of God. He was speaking about obedience to the instructions of
the Spiritual Assemblies, and his point was that the community members
should obey the Assembly members. He stated, “The Spiritual Assembly
will make mistake and their retribution is with God. However, the House
of Justice will not err.” It is evident that the intent of his blessed person
was the Universal House of Justice, which is immune from making any
error.

[Christians]
It was submitted to the blessed presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “What reason
has caused there to be more Christians than Muslims, even though His
Holiness the Messenger of God [Muhammad] declared Himself after His
Holiness Jesus?” He responded, “The reason is that their hand was not
stained by the blood of Prophets.”

[Mírzá Abú’l-Hasan Afnán]
An eminent personage of the Afnán of the Divine Lote-Tree [the family
of the Báb], whose name was Mírzá Abú’l-Hasan, was a resident of
Haifa. He was deeply pious, humble and unassuming, and the object of
attention and bounties of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He had a wife who was also an

Afnán. One day when she was attending to her duties in the kitchen,
suddenly the flames <p.160> engulfed her and caused her death. The
honored Mírzá Abú’l-Hasan was profoundly heartbroken and depressed
over this horrendous incident. Therefore, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had whispered to
him, “I, too, will leave soon.”

After hearing this utterance, he was bereft of patience. Next
morning, after attending to necessary tasks and the purchase of daily
provisions for his household – which had been one of his duties – he set
out at an early hour for the seashore. After discarding his clothing and
placing his green turban, which was his ancestral emblem, over them, he
threw himself into the surging sea.

When this news reached His blessed Person [‘Abdu’l-Bahá], He
instructed that certain sea-experienced souls immediately retrieve his
remains from the grasp of the strong waves. [When he was later
examined, it was discovered that] the fish had only eaten away one of his
eyes.

Thereupon, the funeral of his earthly remains was conducted with
utmost tribute and dignity in the blessed presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

After this incident, three days later, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s blessed
ascension occurred.96

At the time of the funeral procession for the sanctified Temple of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, that Beloved of all creation and that essence of
unquestioned holiness, some of the friends were shouting, “Happy art
thou, O Afnán!”

The aforementioned Áqá Jamál, who was the cook in the blessed
House, used to tell a story that one day the honored [Mírzá Abú’l-Hasan]
Afnán came to the House carrying a quantity of sugar-cube97, remarking,
“Today, the Master said, ‘I asked Áqá Habíb about his business affairs,
and even though I know he has money, he said he did not have anything,
and that saddened me. I asked Áqá Jamál the same, and even though I
know he does not have anything, he expressed his gratitude and
satisfaction. That made Me happy and pleased.’ Now in consideration
that you caused His blessed heart to be filled with joy, I wanted to

96See Appendix 4 for further discussion of this incident.
97The reference appears to be what was known as Russian Sugar-cube, which was a
cone-shaped bulk of sugar.

sweeten your mouth.” With that, he gave me the sugar-cube as a gift.
May God’s mercy and paradise rest upon him!

[Hájí Muhammad Shúshtarí]
There was a certain Hájí Muhammad, who was a native of Shushtar. He
was known as Hájí Muhammad Shúshtarí. Previously he had lived in
Baghdad and many times had walked from that town to the Holy Land
to attain the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and visit the Holy Places. He had
also spent some time in Egypt and Beirut. At the end, in accordance with
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s instruction, he became a resident of the Holy Land, and
for a while was engaged in Haifa as a cobbler – by this means he used to
earn his livelihood.

One day a priest took his shoes to Hájí Muhammad for repair. He
started a conversation with the priest and gradually reached the desired
topic [of teaching him the Bahá’í Faith]. Eventually, he said to him, “You
must worship the donkey, not the cross. This is because Jesus suffered
bitterly on the cross, but His donkey brought Him much ease and
comfort.”

On hearing this, the priest became deeply perturbed and
distressed, and quickly sought the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, complaining
about what had been said to him.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to tell this incident and laugh. He stated, “I said
to the Hájí not to say these things again.”

One time ‘Abdu’l-Bahá related that Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí (the
arch-Covenant-breaker) was passing down a road and Hájí Muhammad
had come face to face with him, but turned his head and changed his
direction. His point was [to illustrate] his constancy and firmness in the
divine Covenant and Testament.

From near or far, whenever his gaze fell upon the blessed Temple
[of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], he would begin to whisper the prayer, “Praise be unto
Thee and thanks be rendered unto Thee.” [He conducted himself] in the
same manner when he attained the presence of the Guardian of the
Cause of God.

He had a most humble dwelling near the blessed House of Haifa.

One day at noon, a number of the friends were partaking of lunch at the

blessed House, and from the window, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá saw <p.165> him
going home. He said, “Hájí Muhammad is an old man. Be considerate of
him.” That is, he should receive a portion from this food and
sustenance.

Outwardly, Hájí Muhammad was frail, fallen and poor. However,
he possessed an extraordinarily pure heart, filled with spirit and joy.

One day in the pilgrim house of the Shrine of the Exalted One
[the Báb] – on the day devoted to visitation of the Shrine, with the
beloved friends of God in the presence of the Guardian of the Cause of
God – one of the friends had put one leg over the other. Hájí
Muhammad considered such an act outside of the bounds of
appropriateness. He rose from his seat and undid his crossed legs. After
so doing, he was rebuked and threatened by the honored Mírzá Hádí
Afnán.98 However, his thoughts were solely centered on the Guardian of
the Cause of God, and none other. May his spirit be gladdened.

He was very close to this servant. One day I said to him, “It would
be good if we made a pact and covenant with each other, and that would
be: If I leave this world before you, then I will come to your dream and
tell you of the condition of that world. And if you leave earlier, then you
do likewise in accordance with this pact and covenant.” He said, “Very
well. I accept.”

He passed away in the blessed House in Haifa during the blessed
days of the Guardian of the Cause of God. The Guardian of the Cause
of God was in attendance at the time of the funeral. The late Áqá ‘Alí-
Asghar,99 that faithful and sacrificial servant of the beloved Guardian of
the Cause of God, related, “Hájí Muhammad would say, ‘I want to go
and see where the Master went.’”

With his own blessed hand, he [Shoghi Effendi] placed a ring-
stone with the death verse inscribed upon it under his tongue,100 and

98 Shoghi Effendi’s father.
99 He is remembered as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s courier. He lived at the home of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá in Haifa, in the apartment on the right hand-side as one enters the main
entrance and passes by the side gardens. On hearing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s passing, he
was so overcome with emotion that he attempted suicide by cutting his own throat.
100 Regarding the deceased, Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-i Aqdas, p. 228, states, “and on

his finger should be placed a ring bearing the inscription ‘I came forth from God,

stated, “Lift Hájí Muhammad with the utmost respect. Hájí Muhammad
is most deserving of our esteem.”

After a few days, he appeared in my dream. I knew in that vision
that he had passed away and, therefore, said to him, “Hájí Muhammad, it
is time to fulfill your pledge.” He replied, “That is true, but I am not
permitted.” That is, he was not allowed to divulge the condition of that
world.

[Hájí Farhán]
There was a believer in Haifa by the name of Hájí Farhán, known as Hájí
Za‘allán and the Hindí. He spoke fluent Hindi with Indians. For a while,
he was united with the Covenant-breakers. According to what he related:

> One day the Covenant-breakers inquired, “Who would
> volunteer to go to India at his own expense in order to
> promote [our cause] there?” That is, promotion of the path
of darkness and misguidance.

They kept repeating this inquiry and I realized that
> they intended for me [to go to India], as there was no one
> else available to undertake this matter. Therefore, I
> volunteered and left ‘Akká, meaning the Mansion of Bahjí,
> which was the seat of the Covenant-breakers, for Haifa, so I
could board a ship leaving for India in three days.

Suddenly, I became gravely ill and pale in Haifa to the

admitted to a hospital.

Day after day, my condition grew worse, and all my

abandoned hope for my recovery.

> consoling me. He said, “We have bestowed health upon

When I woke, I sensed that all parts of my body had

health. I began to sob bitterly.

<p.170> The doctor came in and asked, “What has
> happened?” I said, “‘Abbás Effendi has bestowed health on

amazement that I was in perfect condition.

The Covenant-breakers came to visit me. I said to
> them, “From now on, I have nothing to do with you. All my
> illnesses and misfortunes were as result of your evil activities
and my own idol-worshiping.”

After receiving permission from His blessed presence
> [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], I left Haifa for ‘Akká and arrived to the
> sanctified presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. God only knows how
> that hour [of being with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] passed. The Master
> caressed and comforted me. At that moment, I felt as if I
> had entered paradise by way of hell.

He [Hájí Farhán] would also relate:

> Along with a group of [Muslim] pilgrims passing through
> the region, we attained the presence of the Blessed Beauty
> and were received on the ground floor of the Mansion of
> Bahjí. Bahá’u’lláh gave each of us a handful of nuql.101
> However, some of them, due to torpid and false ideas they
> entertained, threw out the nuql. I gathered all the nuql
> though.

In short, after he [Hájí Farhán] had established his home and
dwelling in Haifa, gradually over time he began to purchase the land on
the east side of the train-station, which at that time was outside the city
limits and away from the residences. He built a modest coffee shop on
the land he had acquired, as well as a home for his own use.
101   Nuql is a sweet, small Iranian candy.

Haifa’s City Hall, 1910

At the same time, he had begun to dig a well [in the courtyard]. He
was nearly at the end of the excavation, when, one day, he had filled the
basket with dirt to be pulled up by the laborer that was standing at the
top of the well, when by chance ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who at times, either on
foot or by carriage, would visit him, arrived on one such visit. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá came by the spot where he [Hájí Farhán] was working at the
bottom of the well, and stood by the well. Thinking that his laborer was
standing at the top of the well, the Hájí shouted with a loud voice,
“Pull.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá pulled on the rope and brought up the basket filled
with earth.

He related [the rest of the story] thus:

> From the bottom of the well, I saw the white skirt of an
> ‘abá, similar to ones His blessed Person would wear. With
> great anxiety, I came up. When my eyes fell upon His
blessed Temple, I was profoundly embarrassed.

It was winter at that time and the days of war, with tea
> and sugar being scarce. He inquired, “Do you have tea?” I
> said that I did not have any. He asked, “How about
> cinnamon?” I replied that I did not have cinnamon either
> and that I only had some ginger. He stated, “Brew that.”

Quickly, I put some [ginger] in a pot, boiled it, and
> took it before His blessed Self. He drank it with utmost
> pleasure.

After he had completed [the construction], he named it ‘Abbás
Land, and devoted all his belongings to the Cause. He was a benevolent
man and His blessed Person was well pleased with him. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
used to say, “Hájí Farhán is a good person.”

During the blessed days of the Guardian of the Cause of God, at
the time that the believers of the Holy Land were sent to other localities
and countries, he too was sent to Sur, which is a town in Syria. It was
there that he joined the Divine Bounty [i.e. passed away].

[A Story from Baghdad]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to relate, “In Baghdad, the friends had gathered and
had a delightful time. A certain Hájí was sitting in a corner, silent and
pensive. Áqá Ibráhím said to him [in verse]: ‘God has bestowed unto us
a mighty mansion, O thou suspicious Hájí, what thoughts dost thou
entertain?’” He would utter this poem with a smile.

In truth, if this suspicion did not exist among the believers in the
Cause of God, what bountiful happiness would surround us! We should
pray unto God to release everyone one from the grasp of this inclination.

[Muhammad-Javád Qazvíní]
One of the pillars of the Covenant-breakers was named Muhammad-
Javád <p.175> Qazvíní. When he strolled, he held his neck exceedingly
straight, particularly if he came upon the friends or His blessed Temple
[‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. ‘Abdul-Bahá would say, “He is like someone with a back
injury, and forced to hold his neck straight to ease the pain.”102

[Various Advices]

102   An approximate translation.

Regarding protection of one’s head, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “The head
must be covered. It will once again return to a turban.”103 His blessed
purpose was that the head should not be left uncovered, so it would be
immune from cold and heat. The interpretation of this is with physicians.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “A husband and wife who greatly love
each other, will be together in the next world also.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “There is no comfort in the world,
except in death.” He then added, “Sanctified is God! Even though
comfort is in death, they flee it.” That is, people do not wish to die.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “No matter how bad a government, it is
better than not having a government.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “If a brawl is taking place, do not tarry
there.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say to the effect, “After a head cold, when
you come out from the bath, eat watermelon to your fill.” The purpose
of His blessed Person was for emission and removal of heat.

He used also to say to this effect, “Diarrhea is beneficial for three
days as it eliminates vapors and heaviness of head. But if it was to last
longer, it would cause harm.” He would moreover state, “Diarrhea has
no medicine. [The cure is] only to skip a meal.”

He spoke of the benefits and influences of quinine.104 His blessed
purpose was that even though medicine will be replaced with nutrition
[for medicinal purposes], quinine would continue to remain.

[Visiting the Needy]
In the mornings, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would go visit the poor and the ill who
were unable to leave [their home] or move. The destitute who were
upholding their public image were aided in secret and stealthy. If a poor

103 The original term is ‘amámih, which typically refers to the type of turbans worn by
Iranian clergies.
104 Quinine is a natural white crystalline alkaloid having antipyretic (fever reducing),

anti-smallpox, analgesic (painkilling), and anti-inflammatory properties. Its main use
in ‘Akká of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s time was as an anti-malarial; for other reported
comments by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá regarding quinine see, Mu’ayyad, Eight Years near ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá: The Diary of Dr. Habíb Mu’ayyad, (Trans. Ahang Rabbani).

person had no family, had fallen ill and was bedridden so that no one
was there to care for him, then He [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] would appoint a nurse
for him until he regained his health.

This servant was twelve years old when for a few days I was
confined to bed due to an illness. At that time, we lived in the Khán
‘Avamíd, and the blessed residence [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] was in the House
of ‘Abdu’lláh Pashá. Suddenly, one early morning, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came
for a visit. With that melodious and enchanting voice, He said, “What is
wrong with Khalílu’lláh?” Immediately, I rose from bed and stood with
my hands folded over my chest. He took my pulse and pronounced,
“No, no, there is nothing wrong.” Then He paused and halted a little
and said, “Marhabá,” and departed.

These doings and the conduct of His blessed Person were all
considerably more effective and superior to mere words. All were
intended for the edification and education of the peoples of the world,
and an example for all humankind. Happy are the ones who succeed in
tracing and following in His footstep. Otherwise, that Master of both
worlds was sanctified and beyond such considerations.

One night there was a gathering in the blessed House of ‘Akká. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá spoke about Takht Jamshíd, which is also written as sacred Text.
His blessed purpose was that the Bahá’ís should return [Persepolis] to its
original condition, and develop and beautify it. He stated, “I cherish this
hope.”105

[Reading]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, “Books are for reading, not for storage in a
container.” <p.180> His purpose was that from reading and studying
benefits would be realized; otherwise, it is the same as its absence.

105 This appears to be a summary of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s exposition on Persepolis, which
is given in a talk on 18 July 1915. For ease of reference, that talk is provided in
Appendix 6 in translation.

[Witchcraft]
[A question about] the nature of magic and witchcraft was asked of the
blessed presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He responded, “It has influence, but
its impact later returns to the original person.” His intent was that a
person would be seized by his own evil machinations.

[The Lukewarm]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say about those lukewarm in the Cause of God, “If
I was to administer the least admonishment to any of them, they would
take the path of the Mansion.”106 However, regarding those constant in
the Cause of God, He would say, “If I force them to leave through the
door, they would come in by the window.” The purpose of His blessed
Person was that, if He did not conduct Himself with wisdom and
compassion, then the weak in constitution who had encircled His
blessed Person would join the Covenant-breakers. Since in those days
the pivot of rebellion and his cohorts were residing in the Mansion of
Bahjí, He stated, “They would take the path of the Mansion.”

Praise be unto God that today, out of the power and sovereignty
of the beloved and appointed Guardian of the Cause of God, the
Mansion has become the point of adoration of all who are under the
shade of Bahá.

However, regarding those who are firm and constant in the divine
Covenant and Testament, no matter how angrily or heatedly He spoke
with them, they would bow more to His sanctified Threshold, would
grow more in humility and meekness, and burn brighter by the fire of
the love of God’s Proof, and more eagerly seek His good-pleasure. It is
why He would say, “If I force them to leave through the door, they
would come in by the window.” Blessed are those who arrive at this state
and sustain this manner.

[Serving Others]
106At that time, Mansion of Bahjí was the seat of the family of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá who
had rebelled against Him.

In some festivals and commemorations, after the meal ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
would pour water for each guest and visitor from a jug among the
pitchers which were common in those days – as there was no better
facility for washing hands and faces. In such a way, each believer and
attendee would wash his hands and face. He would provide this service
in the highest point of perfection for every person, whether lowly or
noble, without any exception.

This demands our reflection and pondering! When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
that Master of both worlds, stood to service to such a degree, then surely
the duty of us, who are naught but servants of that Threshold, is clear
and well evident.

[Some Answered Questions]
In consideration of His many responsibilities, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá revealed the
sacred Kitáb Mufávidát [Some Answered Questions] only at lunchtime. It
was in this manner: after all others commenced lunch, His blessed
Person would pace on one side of the table, back and forth, rather
deliberately, and answer questions raised by Miss Barney.

Laura and Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney in 1906

One day, on the upper apartment of the House of ‘Abdu’lláh
Pashá, a number of pilgrims and resident believers were the guests of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. After ensuring that food was served to each guest and that
everyone was partaking of the meal, He commenced to reveal answers to
questions [of Miss Barney], which were put to Him one after another.
The power of utterance and deduction, which exclusively belongs to the
Manifestations of the Truth, was most evident and apparent.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Eating Habits]
After He sat at table, although different forms of dishes were at hand, he
took three or four mouthfuls of bread and cheese, and then He left.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá ate little. He used to say to this effect, “When I eat, I
become heavy and cannot work. However, if I do not eat, then My vigor
is diminished. There is no choice; something must be consumed.”

[Correspondence]
At the time of responding to the missives sent from diverse corners of
the world to the blessed presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, they were opened in
order, an answer was composed immediately and the secretary would
take the dictation. <p.185> When it was completed, He would tear up
the missive into pieces and would open another envelope. It would go in
thus manner until the end – even though there was no end.

The Pen of the Center of the Covenant wrote some of the
responses.

One day in Haifa, at the time of such compositions, I was in
attendance. It was a particular condition. After I had greatly enjoyed the
experience, He said, “Fí amánu’lláh!”

At the time of the revelation of divine verses, Tablets and prayers,
the majesty of His blessed Person became a hundredfold.

One day in Haifa, a group of the ‘urafá [mystics] were in the
blessed presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. As His blessed Temple spoke with
them, He was engaged in writing. The situation unfolded in such a way
that He read that text [He had just written] to them, which was extensive

and detailed, and composed in utmost eloquence and fluency in Arabic.
They were most bewildered as to how it was possible for Him to be
engaged in conversation, giving answers to their questions and inquiries,
and at the same time compose such remarkable text and prose. Indeed
God was with Him, but they were bereft of recognizing that His power
was beyond any human abilities.107

[Bahá’u’lláh Revealing Tablets]
The paternal uncle of this servant, Áqá Muhammad-Hasan, who was the
custodian of the pilgrim house, used to relate:

> One day, the Ancient Beauty – His exalted Name is supreme
> – was pacing and revealing divine verses. Even though
> Mírzá Áqá Ján, who was His amanuensis and skilled in
> writing rapidly, was leaving many words without their
> required dots, nevertheless he [could not keep up], stopped
> and started crying. Meanwhile, divine verses were pouring
forth like capacious rain.

Suddenly, that Promised Beauty became aware of his
> condition and inquired, “How far were you able to write?”
> When he stated [how far], Bahá’u’lláh responded, “From the
> beginning, it was the most great renewal,108 since this
> unbounded and unrestrained power was solely appointed to
> this mighty Manifestation.”

Moreover, he [Áqá Muhammad-Hasan] also used to relate, “One
day it was inquired of the presence of the Blessed Beauty, ‘From which
direction should the pilgrims return home?’ He responded, ‘The station
of the Godhead is the revelation of divine verses.’”109

107 A more detailed version of this occurrence is told by Afnán, Memories of the Báb,
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, (trans. Ahang Rabbani).
108 The original qiyámat kubrá can also be rendered as the most great resurrection or

revolution.
109 The implication being that certain questions were not worthy of the time and

attention of Bahá’u’lláh. Related to this, the Báb had specifically admonished His

[The Next Manifestation]
At all events, the proof of Manifestationhood up to this mighty and
perfect Dispensation, which in no wise can be compared to the previous
Appearances, has been the revelation of divine verses.110 Moreover, this
proof was concluded with this supreme Manifestation of God, since the
Ancient Beauty states, “Ere this Manifestation, Verses alone had been
the proof unto all.” Then He states, “For in this Manifestation, God –
glorified be His mention – hath willed that most of the believers and the
sincere ones should give utterance to Verses; whence in the next
Dispensation We shall ordain a different matter as proof, lest all who
speak in this fashion should show pride towards God, the All-Powerful,
the All-Compelling, the Almighty;”111 until the end of His sweet
statement.

By clear and explicit divine verses, it is evident and plain that when
the Proof of the next Manifestation appears, it will not be by divine
verses.112 Moreover, that Appearance will be after the completion of a
full thousand years.

According to the statement of the Interpreter of God’s verses –
that is, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Center of divine Covenant and Testament –
the guidance for the present thousand-year manifestation is provided by
followers not to ask questions from Him Whom God shall make manifest – Whom
for the Bahá’ís is fulfilled in Bahá’u’lláh – so that He would be free to address more
exalted themes, such as, His own station.
110 Bahá’u’lláh states (Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 104), “Say: The first

and foremost testimony establishing His truth is His own Self. Next to this
testimony is His Revelation. For whoso faileth to recognize either the one or the
other He hath established the words He hath revealed as proof of His reality and
truth. This is, verily, an evidence of His tender mercy unto men. He hath endowed
every soul with the capacity to recognize the signs of God.”
111 For ease of reference, this Tablet is provided in Appendix 2 in provisional

translation. Appendix 3 provides Nabíl Zarandí’s recollections of Bahá’u’lláh’s
utterances.
112 This statement may need to be reconciled with other texts from Bahá’u’lláh,

where it is implied that revelation of divine verses will always be one of the proofs;
see       for      instance,      La’alí      Hikmat,        vol.       2,     pp.      39;

the Blessed Beauty. For an exposition and explanation of these
statements, refer to Kitáb Rahíq Makhtúm, volume one.113

[Warning Against Claims]
The point is that whenever individuals like the shameless Yahyá [Azal] or
the pivot of rebellion the greater firewood [Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí], or
others advance such claims, or assert Prophethood, then according to
the firm text and the decree of the heaven of the divine will, it is absolute
falsehood, complete fabrication and thorough polytheism, and stems
from misguidance and shamelessness. Likewise, [this is true of] anyone
who makes a claim to the Guardianship, like the perished and base
Remey.114 This is because in accordance with the firm and irrefutable
divine text <p.190> revealed in [‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s] Will and Testament, the
next Guardian must be a descendant of the Guardian of the Cause of
God. That is, he must be an offspring of the blessed temple [of Shoghi
Effendi]. Otherwise, he is not someone whom we would consider as the
Guardian of the Cause, nor is he specific, explicit, appointed or known
as such, and “be as sweet as he is.”

The Guardian of the Cause of God must appoint and designate
the next Guardian, officially and personally. For example, in the Will and
Testament, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in an explicit text appointed Shoghi Effendi
Rabbani, the chosen branch, as the Guardian of the Cause of God and
the authority over the people of Bahá.

Now, if a person advances such a claim that, for instance, he is an
offspring of the Guardian of the Cause of God, and in truth even
entitled to the Guardianship, since the Guardian of the Cause of God
has not appointed him in an explicit text without hints or allusions, then
he would not be acceptable to the people of Bahá. How much truer this
is in case of the crazed Remey and men like him, who are miles and

113 Ishráq-Khávarí, Rahíq Makhtúm, v. 1, Iran, 130 BE, in 762 pages. This book is a
commentary on Shoghi Effendi’s Centennial Letter (known as Lawh Qarn) to the
Bahá’ís of the East.
114 This narrative was composed shortly after the expulsion of Charles Mason

Remey from the Bahá’í community because of his unfounded claim to be Shoghi
Effendi’s successor and the next Guardian.

scores [of miles] away from the principal Tree. Delusion can be
attributed to such individuals.

In the sacred Kitáb-i Aqdas, which is the authority over all the
people of Bahá, the establishment and formation of the Universal House
of Justice is neither conditioned nor related to the presence of the
Guardian of the Cause, so that this can be made into a source of
complaint or protest. Rather, this [i.e. membership of the Guardian on
the Universal House of Justice] is an exposition enshrined in the Will and
Testament. However, the absence of its fulfillment is not a reason for
denying or disallowing the establishment and formation of the Universal
House of Justice, or – and I take refuge with God – a reason for its
invalidity.

The most that can be said is that mighty mysteries are enshrined
and concealed in this, in which at present one of those wisdoms can be
observed. That is: certain ambitious, foolish and lukewarm [individuals]
in the Cause of God, and outside of the straight divine path, are thereby
subjected to test and trial, and unaware and lost, they traverse the field of
darkness.

One day ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “It is not necessary to wait for the
Universal House of Justice to be formed at a time when all have
embraced the Faith. It must take place when a portion of the people
have come under the shadow of the Cause of God.” He did not specify
any other condition.

He would say, “The plan of God is mysterious.” He would also
add, “Odd or even, we will win.”115

[Tests]
One day in the birúní [outer section] of the blessed House of Haifa, He
[‘Abdu’l-Bahá] stated, “I have forgotten my handkerchief.” One of the
friends who was known as Ustád Muhammad-‘Alí Banná, remarked to
this effect, “How is it possible for the manifestation of Truth to forget

115Odd or even is an expression used in rolling the dice in the game of backgammon.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement implies that regardless of crisis and misfortunes visiting
the humanity, God’s plan will ultimately triumph.

anything?” Immediately, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá slapped him and stated, “Over
forgetting a handkerchief that man puts a hundred souls to test.”

Recently, this same person was excommunicated during the
blessed days of the Guardian of the Cause of God and, dejected and
remorseful, left this world.

The point is that such people are bereft of God and unaware of
His plans. “And for them is naught save hell and its fire.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá was speaking in the blessed House of Haifa about
the evil deeds of a person and stated, “I will not mention his name.”
This blessed utterance demonstrated that such individuals are not worthy
of mention or introduction, since the decree of evanescence and
nothingness governs over them.

[The Hands of the Cause]
The Hands of the Cause of God – upon them rest the Glory of God, the
Most Glorious – have each been appointed and designated through the
sovereign will and the encompassing decree of the beloved and the
chosen Guardian of the Cause of God, <p.195> whose will is the same
as God’s will and decree. Therefore, they are representative of his
blessed person and stand to fulfill his wishes. They are considered and
ascribed as the foremost learned in Bahá. Therefore, there is no doubt or
reservation left to anyone with discernment that their love-motivated
decision to establish and form the Universal House of Justice, and
achieve such a bountiful success, the likes of which has never occurred
before and will ever happen again, is by the inspiration and confirmation
of Almighty God, and in accordance with the firm text. Their very
success is manifest and clear evidence, since God has eternally been
protector, supporter and sustainer of His Cause and will ever remain so.
Therefore, no one can deny the services and mighty undertakings of
these sanctified souls, who night and day stood devoted to the Cause,
diffused the divine fragrances, and guided the inhabitants of earth and all
who dwell in various corners and continents.

Remey is also a Hand of the Cause, or was a Hand, and committed
that which is the essence of inequity and most unconscionable. His
deeds demonstrated that a dead branch is worthy of fire, much the same

as the Greater Branch [Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí] became the greater
firewood116 and was sent to the eternal infernal fire. In addition, many
like him have found their way to the lowest abyss. Therefore, we should
know with absolute certainty that such individuals who raise claims are
outside the Cause of God and the straight path of the Lord, and suffer
from mental disturbance. Consequently, in utmost misery and
wretchedness, like the ill-wishing Covenant-breakers, they spend their
time, and at the end will join them. “And this is the reward of their
deeds,” unless they remove their hands from their evil doings and,
penitent and remorseful, return [to the fold].

[An Incident at the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh]
One year during the blessed days of Guardian of the Cause of God, a
large number of pilgrims and resident believers were at hand for the
commemoration of the Ascension of the Blessed Perfection. Everyone
was gathered and present in the garden of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, and
with great sorrow and hearts set on fire, was engaged in reciting divine
verses and prayers in accordance with his blessed instruction.

At that time, a number of women Covenant-breakers who were in
the Mansion entered the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, but their visitation was
prolonged. It appeared that intentionally they did not wish to exit, so
that there would not be an opportunity for the friends of God to enter
the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. Since the time and hour of visitation was
passing and all were waiting for their departure, the Guardian of the
Cause of God stated [to the Shrine’s custodian], “Tell them to come
out.” However, they did not pay any attention and manifested enmity.

Thereupon, by his own sacred self, the Guardian of the Cause of
God rose and entered the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, instructing them to
leave. The greatness and grandeur of his person forcefully precipitated
the exit of that seditious band. At the time of departure, one of the
woman Covenant-breakers had said, “May my life be a sacrifice for the
Most Mighty Branch [‘Abdu’l-Bahá].” Her intent by uttering this remark

116Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí was styled by Bahá’u’lláh as the Greater Branch. After his
break with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, some referred to him as the greater firewood, a play on
words.

was to express her meekness, meaning, “Wrong was perpetrated against
us.”

The Guardian of the Cause of God said to the friends who had
been standing outside waiting for the opportunity to enter [the Shrine],
“Walk around a little until these persons leave.”

Next year, when like the year before, they wanted to enter the
Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, the Guardian instructed, “Do not allow them in.”
At that time, one of the friends of God who was among the resident
believers of that region, whose name was Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rahmán Ardikání,
and who presently resides in Amman [Jordan], stood outside the Shrine
as a guard.117 With a resonant voice, the Guardian of the Cause of God
announced, “‘Abdu’r-Rahmán, do not allow them to enter.” He
informed them [the Covenant-breakers], “Instructions have been receive
to prevent <p.200> your entrance. It is not possible.”

In such manner, they received the punishment for their conduct of
the previous year.

During the course of these events, ‘Alí-Ridá, who was one of the
pillars of the Covenant-breakers, from afar, that is, outside of the
assembly of the friends, had murmured about the possession and seizing
[of the Shrine] and had immediately disappeared from the scene. Later,
this incident was printed in the newspaper, stating in essence, “They
deprived us from visiting our Father.” However, no one heeded their
writings or empty words.

Later, they were completely prevented from entering the Shrine of
Bahá’u’lláh. And this was naught but through the power and might of
the “perspicuous serpent.”118 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had taken an oath that He
would appear with the perspicuous serpent. Therefore, this divine
serpent so thoroughly uprooted the Covenant-breakers, and eliminated
and destroyed them, that forever they will be unable to rise or be
reestablished.

117 ‘Abdu’r-Rahmán and his two younger brothers, Subhí and Khalíl, lived for some
time in Haifa, where Khalíl was in service to the Faith. The two former brothers
lived for some years in Jaffa, before Shoghi Effendi sent them to Jordan. Khalíl’s
daughter, Rúhíyyih, lives presently in Haifa in the same house as her father’s.
(Hossein Achtchi, private communications, 10 March 2008.)
118 See discussion of the “perspicuous serpent” earlier in this narrative.

[Sádhijih]
Mírzá Badí‘u’lláh had given his daughter, Sádhij, in marriage to the
owner of the Karmel Newspaper, who was an old man, a Christian, and
whose name was Nassar.119 Even though they presented themselves as
Muslims, this deed [i.e. marriage to a Christian] was against Islamic
jurisprudence.

Najib Nassar

‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to the effect, “They asked Mírzá Muhammad-
‘Alí (the arch-Covenant-breaker) of the station and rank of Bahá’u’lláh.
He said, ‘My Father was a Dervish.’”

119 Born to a Greek Orthodox family in Tiberius, Najib al-Khuri Nassar (1865-1948)
converted to Protestantism while working for 15 years in a hospital run by
missionaries. He then worked briefly as a land sales agent for the Jewish
Colonization Association before founding the daily newspaper al-Karmil in 1908 in
Haifa. Nassar used his knowledge of land sales to Jews to write articles against the
Jewish settlers and the first history of the Zionist movement in Arabic, Zionism: Its
History, Object and Importance. Before World War I, he founded several activist
organizations to limit Jewish immigration and land sales. Al-Karmil was closed
permanently by court order in 1944. Nassar died in Nazareth. See, Mandel, Neville
J. The Arabs and Zionism before World War I. Berkeley: University of California Press,
1976\.

At any rate, their purpose from so doing [marriage of Sádhij with
Nassar] was that whenever they wanted, they could publish their
falsehoods, lies and fabrications against ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Center of
divine Covenant and Testament, and that Karmel Newspaper would be
at their disposal. “O regret for such deeds!”

At the end, they were seized by the greatest misery and were
thoroughly obliterated.120

[Mírzá Asadu’lláh Isfahání]
There was a certain Mírzá Asadu’lláh, a native of Isfahan. He was related
to the members of the blessed household.121 From a distance, some new

arrivals would mistake his appearance for the blessed temple of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. This was because in clothing, attire, style of beard and turban –
and I take refuge unto God! – he appeared to look like ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
For this reason, some would mistake this imitator [for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
from a distance and would bow down, which would please him.
However, when the visitors learned of their error, they would be sad and
disturbed. Sanctified is God! What wickedness is this and what false
imaginings!

At last he was dismissed and left for America. It was there that his
life ended.

[Refinement]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to tie a white cloth around His inner cap and His
blessed head. Even though He did so with utmost speed, it was
extremely refined and methodical, such that others, no matter how much
time they spent, were never able to replicate His manner.

One time the Guardian of the Cause of God was instructing how
the sheets designed to spread over the mandars [“benches”] in the blessed
House of Haifa were to be cut. The Greatest Holy Leaf, the Liege Lady
of the people of Bahá, stated, “How have you learned such things?” He
replied, “By deductive reasoning.”

It is certain that it is so, since the manifestations of God are
themselves the essence of logic.

[Simplicity]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “If not for the grandeur of the Cause, I would
not even wear this attire;” even though His blessed appearance was most
simple. That is, it consisted of a long garment and a thin overcoat. In
winters, He would add a cotton ‘abá. Even then, when He came upon a
destitute person in His path, He would bestow the ‘abá on him.

121Mírzá Asadu’lláh had married the sister of Munírih Khánum, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
wife. He rendered notable services to the Faith, including the transfer of the Báb’s
remains from Iran to the Holy Land. However, later he followed his son, Dr.
Fareed, in rebellion against ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and was excommunicated.

Therefore, from His blessed utterance it can be discerned that
clothing is only for the purpose of covering the body, and one must not
be attracted to lavishness.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “If one’s clothing has a patch, there is
no harm. But it must be clean.”

One of the servants of the blessed House was Bashír. He passed
away in Haifa <p.205> in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s residence.122 He was
exceedingly devoted and interested in the cleanliness of his headgear and
its presentation. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to him, “Do not be so excessively
concerned with spotlessness of your hat.” That is, every undertaking, no
matter how desirable, has limits.

At one time in Iran, the government forbade the wearing of the
‘abá. The Guardian of the Cause of God stated, “The ‘abá is a good
thing.”

[Sweetmeat]
During the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, one day a number of Iranian
pilgrims were invited for lunch to the blessed House in Haifa. At
lunchtime, this servant also attained unto this bounty. Among the food
items and various dishes on the table, there were plates filled with
bámiyih.123 This particular sweetmeat was not common at that time in
Iran, and indeed did not exist. Therefore, the pilgrims were hesitant in
partaking of them. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “This is bámiyih. It is a natural
laxative and reduces the bile.124” After this remark, they were favored
with great appetite and much enjoyment, with coincided with
considerable cheers and delight.
122 On the manner of unfortunate incident leading to Bashír’s death see, Mu’ayyad,
Eight Years near ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: The Diary of Dr. Habíb Mu’ayyad, (trans. Ahang
Rabbani).
123 A confection resembling the shape of okra.
124 The original term safrá is yellow bile (sometimes called ichor), which together

with black bile were two of the four vital fluids or humors of ancient and medieval
Islamic and European medicine (the other two were phlegm and blood). The Latin
name for yellow bile gave rise to the word choler. Excessive yellow bile was supposed
to produce an aggressive temperament, known as choleric. The word bilious refers
especially to a temperament produced by an excess of black bile.

[Bahiyyih Khánum]
During the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, suddenly the Greatest Holy
Leaf, the Liege Lady of the people of Bahá – may my soul be a sacrifice
unto her meekness – became ill and bedridden. Smilingly, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
said to His illustrious sister, “Do what you wish, but I have work for
you.” That is, “If you wish to depart this world, for now suspend that
idea, as there is much work that remains which you must shoulder.”

In truth, the veracity of His blessed utterance became evident after
His ascension when it was observed what significant and critical matters
were entrusted to her.125 In this regard, the beloved Guardian of the
Cause of God has written extensively.

125During the first decade of Shoghi Effendi’s ministry, Bahíyyih Khánum often
served as the Head of the Faith during the Guardian’s absence from Haifa.

Whether during the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, or during the
blessed period of the Guardian of the Cause of God, the Greatest Holy
Leaf was their principal representative.126 Night and day, she was
engaged in service within and outside the Cause, administration of daily
affairs of the household, serving as host to friends and strangers by her
own sacred self, and many other matters and affairs that remain
unnumbered and unaccounted. All of this while she was brokenhearted
over the infidelity, deeds and activities of the Covenant-breakers both in
[the Holy Land] and outside. These things brought much harm to her
tender and delicate person. Nevertheless, she endured it all with the
utmost dignity, calm, patience, fortitude, serenity and composure. She
was a singular friend and companion to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the Guardian
of the Cause of God. Except each [of these luminous figures] had their
own sphere of responsibility, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s was so extensive that
He would say, “I must even think of the hay and fodder for the horses.”

> The Greatest Holy Leaf was the treasure house of mysteries.127

When Arab ladies were invited to the blessed House of Haifa, and
a gathering held in the evening, coinciding with this servant having the
bounty of attaining as well, then word would be sent [by Bahiyyih
Khánum] that I should chant Arabic prayers. It was mentioned to her
sanctified presence, “That person [i.e. Khalíl Shahídí] chants well.” She
had responded, “He chants eloquently.” This was yet another bounty
upon this hapless and unworthy servant.

At the time of her ascension, she was looking heavenwards saying,
“Very well. Wait, I am coming.” It was evident that from the world
above that the spirits of the Concourse on High, impatiently and with
great fervor, were anticipating the arrival of the pure and sanctified soul
of that remnant of God and trust of Bahá, which propelled her to speak
such words of assurance to them.

126 The original na‘amu’l-vakíl implies more than being the principal representative or
prime confidant and suggests a standing as the deputy or principal substitute.
127 Another reading of makhzan asrár is vault of secrets. While it is true that Bahiyyih

Khánum was entrusted with the most confidential matters of the Faith, such as
being charged with secretly housing the remains of the Báb in her room for over a
decade, it appears that the intent of the narrator by asrár refers more to spiritual
mysteries.

The Greatest Holy Leaf was extremely sympathetic, <p.210> kind
and compassionate. With great care, she would inquire of the minute
details of all affairs and would administer every enterprise. She would
bring about the healing of every ill and unwell person, would give timely
advice and counsel, and guide every wayward one. Whenever someone
would speak of God, she would immediately utter words of affirmation.

In truth, she was the solver of every difficulty and the tender
friend of the people of Bahá.

[Mount Carmel]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to praise and admire the vivifying effect of the air of
Mount Carmel. For instance, He would say to this effect, “Whatever
problem that a person may have, if he was to stroll a little in that air and
think about his problem, a solution would be presented. Whoever wants
to live a long life should live there.”

He would also say to this effect, “From the perspective of its
natural beauty and pleasantness, it is preferable to all other locations.”

The Guardian of the Cause of God used also to greatly extol
[Mount Carmel], particularly the spot where the Shrine of the Exalted
One is located.

[Ottoman Military]
Prior to the intervention of the British government, the Ottoman
authorities had decided to draft the Iranian youth residing in that region
into their military and began that process. However, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
influence prevented this.

At that time in ‘Akká, He instructed this servant to go to the
pilgrim house of the Shrine of the Exalted One [the Báb] so that I would
be away from the eyes of the authorities. Therefore until such time as the
eminent British government arrived [in the Holy Land], I was staying
and serving at the pilgrim house of the Shrine of the Exalted One.

[Mullá Abú-Tálib Badkubih’í]

There was a certain Mullá Abú-Tálib, who was a native of Badkubih,
whose age was in excess of one hundred and ten years.128 In accordance
with the blessed instruction [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], he resided in one of the
rooms on the lower floor of the pilgrim house. He was deeply faithful,
had great certitude, and was the recipient of attention and bounties of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He was happy, thankful and appreciative for the sweet
humor of His blessed Person.

One day ‘Abdu’l-Bahá visited his room. After He had inquired of
his health, he [Mullá Abú-Tálib] had said, “Since I do not have any
companions, I am lonely.” At that point, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá summoned me
and stated, “Each day, you must sit and for two hours converse with
Mullá Abú-Tálib.”

After a few days, he said to the blessed presence [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá],
“I am most pleased with him [Khalíl Shahídí].” He responded, “‘Abdu’l-
Bahá is also pleased with him.”

One day he had submitted [to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], “If You grant
permission, I would like to go for a few days to the Ridván Garden.” He
responded, “What for? Stay here.” However, since he wished to go, He
replied further, “Very well.”

> Two or three days later, he passed away in the Ridván Garden.

Thereupon, in accordance with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s blessed instruction,
a number of the friends from Haifa proceeded to the Ridván Garden for
his funeral procession. This servant was in their company as well.

His resting-place was in the Bahá’í cemetery of ‘Akká. However, it
was among the graves that were not yet built. Since there were no
numbers [on the graves], its location is unknown.

128He accepted the Faith through Nabíl’s efforts and became the first Bahá’í in the
Caucasus; Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p. 176. “Two doors, one facing north
towards ‘Akká and the other on the eastern side of the Shrine, are named for Ustád
Áqá ‘Alí-Ashraf and Ustád Áqá Bálá, sons of Mullá Abu-Tálib. These two brothers
were master masons who went on pilgrimage from their native town of Baku,
Russia [now Azerbaijan], and with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s permission remained for some
time in the Holy Land. During this period, they devoted their efforts to the
construction of the Shrine and offered financial contributions towards the project”;
Ugo Giachery, Shoghi Effendi - Recollections, p. 214.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “If Mullá Abú-Tálib had not gone [to
the Ridván Garden], he would have lived a while longer.” His blessed
point was to praise the refreshing air of Mount Carmel.

[Tobacco]
According to what this servant has heard from those that beheld the
Countenance of the Lord [i.e. Bahá’u’lláh], one day during the time of
the Blessed Perfection – may His mention be supreme – a group of the
believers in God gathered in the Ridván Garden.

Suddenly, they learned of the arrival of the Blessed Beauty. At that
time, one of them was smoking a waterpipe. Immediately, he concealed
it in the tall and thick bushes. Upon arrival, the Temple of the Truth –
that all-knower of hidden and visible – had proceeded directly to the
spot where the waterpipe was hidden, <p.215> and stated, “This is why
God has forbidden its use.”

During the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, when different visitors
would arrived in His sanctified presence, some would present Him with
cigarettes. In order to please them, the blessed Temple would accept
them. One day, He remarked to the Greatest Holy Leaf, “Khánum, they
insist on giving cigarettes to us. My chest has developed aches. I am in
pain.”

One night, there was a gathering in the blessed House of ‘Akká
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá uttered words to this effect, “It is strange. Even
though everyone knows the harm of cigarettes, yet people consume
them. Civilization will advance to a point one day that they will say, ‘Why
did previous generations use cigarettes which are so harmful?’ This will
greatly puzzle them.”

When Lawh Dukhán was revealed by the pen of the Center of the
divine Covenant and Testament,129 even though Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl was an
old man and deeply addicted to the use of tobacco, to the point that he
would light his cigarette with the previous one, nevertheless he

129 Lawh Dukhán was composed in honor of Muhammad-Husayn Vakíl. It is known
in the West as the Tablet of Purity and is published in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections from
the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, pp. 145-50. Smoking is not forbidden in the Bahá’í Faith,
but ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has discouraged it for the sake of health and cleanliness.

immediately threw his cigarette case and accessories through the window
and announced, “From now on, separation between me and you
[tobacco]!”

Similarly, many other elders of the Faith, both men and women,
[suspended the use of tobacco], even though the intent was for the
younger members to come to their senses, since the Blessed Perfection
has exempted the older ones from this injunction. In truth, this
ordinance was aimed at the youth so they would purify and cleanse
themselves.130 Nevertheless, it was the elders who pioneered in their
obedience.

Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí also abandoned the use of tobacco.

However, since he was frail and unwell, he became severely ill. No
matter how much the physician insisted, he refused to resume his
smoking. It went thus until that compassionate and kind Master gave
him permission [to smoke] and exempted him from this [prohibition].
After that permission, he would halve his cigarettes and of that half,
would smoke only a half – and even that was out of obedience to the
wishes of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

…131

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Health]
130 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states the following in Lawh Dukhán (Selections from the Writings of
‘Abdu’l-Baha, p. 147):

> The Báb, at the outset of His mission, explicitly prohibited tobacco,
> and the friends one and all abandoned its use. But since those were
> times when dissimulation was permitted, and every individual who
> abstained from smoking was exposed to harassment, abuse and even
> death – the friends, in order not to advertise their beliefs, would
> smoke. Later on, the Book of Aqdas was revealed, and since smoking
> tobacco was not specifically forbidden there, the believers did not
> give it up. The Blessed Beauty, however, always expressed repugnance
> for it, and although, in the early days, there were reasons why He
> would smoke a little tobacco, in time He completely renounced it,
> and those sanctified souls who followed Him in all things also
> abandoned its use.

131 A small paragraph pertaining to the private life of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is left

untranslated.

If we were to overlook certain illnesses and infirmities that would
sometimes visit His blessed Temple – most of which were caused and
brought about by the Covenant-breakers – His blessed Person was in
excellent health.

The arch-Covenant-breaker [Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí] was
remorseful over this matter. One day ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, out of wisdom and
by design, said to him, “After Me, it will be you.” He responded, “It is
not certain.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said no more to him. In truth, he lived after
the blessed ascension [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], but his life was like death.132

If ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s will and decree had not ordained His ascension,
He would have stayed longer in this world, since His sanctified being
was bereft of any illness or decease. However, God’s inscrutable wisdom
decreed as it occurred.

[Card Playing]
The blessed presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was asked about playing cards
with no intention of gambling. He replied, “It is a waste of time.”

This blessed utterance demonstrated that from such proclivities,
not only would a person squander his time, but he may gradually be
drawn to gambling as well, <p.220> and be distanced from sincerity and
spirituality.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá Watering the Gardens]
During the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, at the time of the World War
[I], the garden at the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh was watered by a hand pump
installed in the garden. Whenever it was possible, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would go
and pump water with His blessed hands while whispering prayers.133

For a long time before installation of this pump, indeed for many
years, the garden of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh was watered using large jars
known as jarrah, or with large tin cans, from an aqueduct that passed by

Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí passed away in 1937, some 16 years after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

\[132\] 
For more details see, Mu’ayyad, Eight Years near ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: The Diary of Dr.

\[133\] 
Habíb Mu’ayyad, (trans. Ahang Rabbani).

the spruce-fir trees across from the Shrine – this waterway was known as
Áb-i Kábarí. It was through this method that the garden was irrigated.

On the days devoted to general visitation [of the Shrine], using
jarrahs built by my father, Ustád Abú’l-Qásim, which some of the friends
of God had donated to the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, the believers would
collectively participate in carrying water from the aqueduct to irrigate the
garden in accordance with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s instructions.

My father was responsible for filling each of the jarrahs with water
from the aqueduct. After filling ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s jarrah, my father would
dry the jar with a towel and then softly place it over ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
shoulder, in accordance with His wish.

This process would continue a number of times, and they would
go back and forth, until the garden was fully irrigated.134

At all events, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá – the Master of the people of Bahá –
would manifest and demonstrate such a degree of submissiveness and
servitude to the Threshold of the Blessed Perfection, so that His deeds
would be an example for all who profess belief in Bahá.

[Financial]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, “Having no money is arduous. But too much of
it also causes difficulties.” The truth of this utterance is clear and evident
unto every man of discernment. His purpose was moderation in earning
a livelihood.

[An Attempt to Defraud ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
During the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, several authorities of the
Ottoman government who worked in an office in ‘Akká decided,
through deceit and trickery, to force ‘Abdu’l-Bahá into paying a large and
significant sum that they had in mind. However, that essence of
generosity and favor [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] would never give a single coin to
anyone as a bribe or in fear.

134Four lines at the top of page 222 are crossed out beyond readability. They appear
to recount an insulting comment by one of the Covenant-breakers.

They selected one of their own to go before His blessed Person to
implement their evil and wrong-headed plan. When he arrived [before
‘Abdu’l-Bahá], he spoke facts that were manufactured and resided
outside the truth, all intended to [cause] harm and loss to the Cause. This
representative spoke to this effect, “The government has decided to do
this or that [action against the Faith], but it is possible through a
payment of such an amount to prevent the government from taking this
action.” His entire presentation to the end was such unsound and untrue
statements.

Thereupon, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sought water to perform His ablution.

With the utmost deliberation, He completed His ablution and then
commenced to perform the long obligatory prayer of the Muslims.
During His prayer, the man kept interrupting, “This matter must
<p.225> be concluded quickly, as there is little time!” Meaning that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá should end His obligatory prayer and attend to this urgent
matter.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá finished His prayer, with the utmost dignity and
authority He came close to him and slapped him several times, saying, “I
sent it for you.”

With great stress and anxiety, never having imagined such an
outcome, he held his face and head, and shouting, screaming and
roaring, he returned to the government office and informed his
comrades of what had transpired.

That very night telegraphs in Turkish were received from the
Sublime Port [Istanbul] for each one of them, signed by one of the
eminent and distinguished personages in the [Central] government.
These telegraphs dismissed each one of them from office and further
instructed them to kiss the hand of ‘Abbás Effendi.

This incident heightened the wonder and astonishment of every
high and low citizen, marveling how and when ‘Abbás Effendi had
informed Istanbul so that at such an hour of the night dismissal orders
were dispatched. Of course, in view of their lack of faith, they were right
to wonder in this regard.

Those around these men became deeply frightened and perturbed,
and for this reason hastened to the presence of His blessed Person and
through this act expressed their humility, beseeching His good-pleasure.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, “I am sitting in this room, but I spin the
world around My little finger.” His purpose by this comment was that
the sovereign will and abiding decree of His sanctified being was the
same as the will and decree of God.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Generosity]
One day ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was at Jámi‘ Jazzár [al-Jazzár mosque] and a group
of eminent citizens were in His presence. One of the inhabitants of
‘Akká arrived and whispered [to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], “My wife has just given
birth and I have no money.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gave him a five lira gold coin.
With that, he prepared all the necessary provisions. When the people
that were aware of his meager situation inquired, he responded, “This
alleviated situation is out of the favors and bounties of His Holiness
‘Abbás Effendi.”

The generosity, munificence, mercy and benevolence of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá surrounded every deserving person.

[The Seed of the Next Manifestation]
One time ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “The next Manifestation will also appear
through Me.” From this utterance, it was understood that the next
Manifestation would be of the blessed descendants of the Center of the
divine Covenant and Testament, and none other.

Praise be unto God that in this mighty Dispensation nothing has
been left undisclosed. We must pray unto God to give sight to every
sightless one.

[Bahá’í Marriage Recognition in Iran]
For a while during the blessed days of the Guardian of the Cause of
God, the exalted government of Iran was most hostile towards the
Bayáníc135 marriages and considered them unofficial. This opposition

135Since the Bahá’í law of marriage in the Aqdas is derived from the Bayán, often the
early literature of the Faith referred to it as the Bayáníc marriage.

was such that after the marriage ceremony, the [Bahá’í] couple would be
imprisoned and punished.

During these upheavals, the beloved Guardian of the Cause of
God stated to this effect, “In Iran, marriage will become civil based. The
friends must persevere and establish firm foundations so they do not
participate in this instance.”

[Snake]
In Tiberius, one night near the morning, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá noticed that a
snake had crawled under His cushion. He instructed to this effect, “Put
him in a bag, take him to the field and release him. But do not slay him.”

This kindness of His blessed Self was <p.230> consistent with the
explicit text of His in which it is stated, “Unless ye must, bruise not the
serpent in the dust, how much less wound a man.”136

[Visiting the Shrine]
During the blessed period of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, on the days when the friends
of God attained and achieved visitation of the Shrines of Bahá’u’lláh or
the Exalted One [the Báb], for the sake of wafting pleasant fragrances,
His blessed Person would sprinkle each person with the essence of red
rose or pure perfume. And if for some reason He was not there and the
visitors [to the Shrine] were deprived of beholding the Countenance of
that beloved Beauty, then the custodian of that Threshold would carry
out this task and perfume everyone.

This practice and tradition was continued and maintained in the
same exact form during the blessed days of the Guardian of the Cause of
God.137

At the time of the arrival of the British government in Palestine
and the Holy Land, many of their soldiers were Indian, and a large
contingent of them set camp in the vicinity of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh.

136 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 256; the official
translation is not precise.
137 The present translator recalls the same practice continuing into mid 1970s by the

custodians of the Shrines.

Since they considered the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh a sacrosanct spot and a
site of visitation, they would go and enter the Shrine at the time of the
obligatory prayer, and to the extent they had time engaged in offering
their supplications and prayers.

Whenever ‘Abdu’l-Bahá went to visit [the Shrine], they would
attain His blessed presence and partake of that bounty.

Since the aforementioned Áqá Siyyid Abú’l-Qásim Khurásání was
somewhat familiar with the Hindi language, he would serve as a
translator for the blessed utterances [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. However, he
would excessively use Kertahi and Murtazi dialects. Therefore, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá said to him, “This is all Kertahi and Murtazi!” His own Person
recounted this story with much laughter and delight.

Bahjí 1918

At all events, one day He remarked to those soldiers, “Whatever is
your wish, ask it of this Sanctified Edifice and it will be granted.” After
hearing this utterance, immediately they performed their ablutions,
entered the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh and commenced their entreaties and
obligatory prayers.

After this event, only within two or three days, a telegraph with
the instruction for their discharge and return home was received. At that
time they would say with the utmost happiness and excitement, “Our
appeal to this Sanctified Edifice was this [returning home]. Praise be
unto God that He accepted our plea.”

[Dreams]
Once the aforementioned Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl had a dream in which he
had seen himself in Iran. He had inquired [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] about that
vision. He replied, “Do not forget this dream.”

At the time that the Guardian of the Cause of God sent him and
his kinfolks to Tehran, that exact vision came to pass.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “Whoever has a vision of the Prophets
and the chosen ones in a dream, that dream is true.”

[Benefits of Grapes]
One afternoon Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rasúl Mansúr took some excellent grapes
from ‘Akká to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s blessed presence in Bahjí. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
replied, “Today My meal was heavy and I wanted some grapes.”
Therefore, He immediately partook of some.

> His blessed purpose was that grapes enhance digestion.

Regarding radishes, which in Arabic are called fujl, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
would say, “A fujl enhances digestion. However, a radish itself is hard to
digest.”

[Divine Laws]
One day the Guardian of the Cause of God was in the pilgrim house of
the Shrine of the Exalted One. That day was a day for general visitation,
and as such, a group of <p.235> the friends of God, both pilgrims and
resident believers, were in his presence. Among his blessed utterances to
that assemblage, words to this effect were included, “I have received a
letter from one of the friends in the West in which he has suggested that
I remove the law of fasting from the Book.” With a baffled look and

smiling, he added, “I wrote him that these are divine laws and
ordinances.”

His blessed purpose was that teachings and exhortations that have
been sent down from the heaven of the divine decree will remain and are
established until the end of eternity, and under no circumstances may a
word or a jot of it be changed or altered.

[A Contemporary Violator of the Covenant]
It may be that the questioner had asked about this matter [fasting] out of
simplicity, or perhaps he was a new Bahá’í, but in these days in which
God’s Universal House of Justice has been formed and established, and
the sovereignty and grandeur of the Cause of God has penetrated all
corners of the globe, and rank upon rank are entering with humility and
meekness beneath the Word of God, a foolish and unthinking person,
with evil and base intentions, has shamelessly attempted such a thing.138
That is, through his vain imaginings, false ideas, and evil, petrified and
empty thoughts, which all stem from passion and desires, he has
abrogated many of the laws and teachings of the Kitáb-i Aqdas –
revelations which are the spirit of this age, sufficient for the happiness of
humankind, and the savior of all that dwell on earth from every harm
and difficulty. In addition, his cohorts, whose pride and egotism are
combined with mindlessness and stem from irreligiosity and absence of
faith, have arisen to assist and aid that senseless polytheist.

This wayward and misguided person has opposed the explicit
divine texts, and under all conditions has raised complaints, criticism and
opposition based on his own desires and passions, much like the pivot of
rebellion [Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí] and the abased Covenant-breakers.
More or less, he is engaged in interpretation and elucidation, and day and
138This section appears to be a reference to Jamshíd Ma’ání, an Iranian Bahá’í, who
in the 1960s claimed to be a new Manifestation of God (despite Bahá’u’lláh’s
specific prohibition in the Kitáb-i Aqdas against such a claim before less than 1000
years passed). He gained some following, mainly in Iran, and later was expelled by
the Universal House of Justice. He formed an organization called, “The House of
Mankind” (which is also known as the “Faith of God”) and the “Universal Palace of
Order,” which now appear to be defunct, as announced by the Encyclopedia of
Religions: http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html

night, with great insistence and much audacity, employs every means to
divert simpletons from the straight path, and to bring them to imbibe
the poison of faithlessness.

It is evident that association with the ignorant and unwise, and
those unaware of the truth of the Cause and God’s inscrutable teachings,
with such evil and satanic individuals, will result in being sealed with the
mark of the violation of the Covenant, and becoming dispersed,
confused, dejected, humbled, ashamed before the community and also
by their family and loved ones, and in being cast afar and distanced.
Moreover, they will achieve the loss of both worlds and God’s
chastisement.

Moreover, with the utmost impudence, deceit and trickery, these
polytheists have written letters to various places so that others would be
diverted from the straight path of God, and join them in their shameful
and superfluous beliefs.

Even though they stand condemned at God’s door, and immersed
in misery and deprivation, they have not repented or atoned. They
consider the Cause of God to be a plaything of the foolish, and have
preferred fire to eternal life.

At the end, such people will become an example for all people to
avoid. Praise and glorification be unto God, for having completed, in
every manner, His proof unto the people of Bahá, and for having
established the exalted institution of the Hands of the Cause of God,
and through explicit, clear, evident text having enjoined upon all to turn
to the sublime threshold of God’s Universal House of Justice, may its
pillars be strengthened. <p.240>

[Pages 240-241 are missing in the copy of the manuscript available to the present
translator. It appears that in this section, the marriage of Shoghi Effendi and
Ruhiyyih Khánum is recounted. Translator.]

[The Marriage of Shoghi Effendi and Rúhiyyih Khánum]
… upon both be the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, proceeded in an
automobile from the blessed House of Haifa to the Shrine of

Bahá’u’lláh. After their visitation and return, their marriage vows were
taken that very night in the chamber of the Greatest Holy Leaf – the
remnant of God and the trust of Bahá – who longed to witness such an
hour. The marriage readings were recited softly by his own blessed
temple [Shoghi Effendi] in the presence of those maidens of celestial
heaven and the parents of both sides.

After the conclusion [of the ceremony], he turned to that essence
of sanctity [Bahiyyih Khánum] and said words to this effect, “Khánum,
the marriage ceremony took place in your chamber.”

> In short, with utmost reverence and dignity it was concluded.

In the morning, when the friends of God learned and became
aware of this most mighty tidings and this joyous news, out of their
delight and exhilaration, they decided to hold a [marriage] celebration in
the blessed House. However, when this was mentioned to his blessed
presence, he stated, “The friends may do what they wish, but in their
own homes.”

In truth, a joy and elation enveloped everyone on that day that is
beyond any description, mention or exposition.

In beauty, splendor, perfection and dignity, Ruhiyyih Khánum was
like the Virgin Mary, and in truth, was a product of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
influence. This is because her illustrious parents – upon both rest the
mercy and paradise of God – made an appeal. His blessed will and
decree bestowed upon them this mighty bounty and precious trust [i.e.
Rúhiyyih Khánum]. How sweet it is that out of the kindness and
compassion of His Holiness, every aspect of this marriage took place.

[Gift from America]
After Rúhiyyih Khánum’s marriage, as a gift and a good omen, the
Bahá’ís of America presented and submitted a chest of luxurious and
expensive clothes, which typically were worn by the westerners. <p.245>
However, this was not acceptable unto her and she stated in effect,
“Such attire is not the clothing for this place” and in accordance with her
instructions, they were returned.139

From the original, it is not clear if it was Rúhiyyih Khánum or Shoghi Effendi

\[139\] 
who did not accept the gift of clothing and instructed that it be returned.

[A Gift for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
In the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, a container full of the finest prized
tableware was presented to Him. However, upon seeing it and before
they were removed from the container, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated, “These will
not be of benefit to us.” Therefore, in the same manner and condition as
they had been in the container, He bestowed them upon someone else.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá enjoyed a simple and uncomplicated life, even in
food and clothing.

My mother used to relate that the Blessed Beauty would say,
“Prepare only one dish, but make it in perfection.”

[Mírzá Mahmúd Zarqání]
The honored Mírzá Mahmúd Zarqání was a teacher of the Faith during
the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and readily stood to the service and
promotion of the Cause of God, and the diffusion of divine fragrance.
After the ascension [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], through the bounties and
benevolence of the Guardian of the Cause of God and in accordance
with the command [of Shoghi Effendi], he was engaged day and night in
writing and speaking [for the Faith] and, as before, continued to remain
in the utmost constancy and firmness.

One night, there was a gathering in the blessed House of Haifa.

Because of his many obligations, he [Zarqání] arrived a little late. The
Guardian of the Cause of God – may my spirit be a sacrifice unto his
kindness – said to him, “I give you too much work. I am embarrassed.”

In truth, this very remark, which was solely out of his benevolence
and munificence, would suffice Mírzá Mahmúd in both worlds.

After ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ascension, he composed a poem, which
included this repeated refrain:

O ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, glance over us,

Glance from that world above.

This poem greatly attracted the blessed attention of the Guardian
of the Cause of God and he would instruct, “Recite it.” Therefore,
collectively and in a heartrending tone, this poem would be recited [by
the friends].

After some time, when the Guardian of the Cause of God was
away [from Haifa], he journeyed from the Holy Land to Iran. However,
during his return, suddenly he became ill, passed away in Rasht, and
joined the Exalted Paradise.140

After the passing of that devoted servant of God, the beloved
Guardian of the Cause of God would speak about him, including the
remark, “The preciousness of Mírzá Mahmúd Zarqání’s services will
become evident in the future.”

[Mírzá Mahmúd Furúghí]
The honored Mírzá Mahmúd Furúghí was one of the teachers and
eminent believers of the Cause. He had [previously] been a cleric. He
was a native of Dughabad of Khurasan.141

One day in ‘Akká while offering his obligatory prayer, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá suddenly entered the room. He immediately turned his face
towards the brilliant visage of the Master. However, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to
him, “Mind your business!” That is, in the course of obligatory prayer,
one’s attention must remain solely, and without any deviation, on the
Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh which is point of adoration of the people of Bahá.

One day in the pilgrim house of the Shrine of the Exalted One,
while he was listening to the recitation of God’s verses, after hearing
some passages, from the attraction and enkindlement of the fire of
God’s love that burnt brightly in his soul, suddenly he removed his
turban and fiercely threw it to the ground.

140 Zarqání’s passing took place on 11 October 1927 and he is buried in Mudíriyyih
Cemetery.
141 For intriguing stories about him see, Afnán, In the Land of Refuge: The Genesis of the

Bahá’í Faith in Shiraz; (trans. Ahang Rabbani), and for a more complete biography
see, Bushrú’í, The Voice of the Heroes: The Genesis of the Bahá’í Faith in Khurasan, (trans.
Ahang Rabbani).

This intense condition, which stemmed from his indescribable
love and enthrallment, would occur from time to time, and would draw
and fascinate the attention of the listeners. However, later, in view of the
fact the beloved Guardian of the Cause of God had said to him,
“Remain in a calm state,” he changed his behavior and would maintain
his peace and composure.

[Condition of Confirmation]
<p.250> The Guardian of the Cause of God – may my spirit be a
sacrifice unto him – had dismissed one of the friends [who was resident
in the Holy Land] in favor of Egypt with the promise of success. After a
while, one of the believers of that region attained his blessed presence,
and that night a gathering was held in the blessed House of Haifa. In
that assembly, he reported in effect the following on the condition of
that person [sent to Egypt], “He stated, ‘The Guardian of the Cause of
God promised me confirmations, but I am not successful yet.’ I said to
him, ‘Success is conditioned upon and results from efforts and exertions
on the requirements.’”

The Guardian praised and approved this comment, and remarked,
“It is as you state.”

His purpose was that success comes from action in undertakings,
and comes from endeavoring and instigating.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, “Confirmations and success are
suspended betwixt earth and heaven. That is, only action is required for
it to be realized.”

[Provocation of the Opponents]
During the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in ‘Akká, the spiteful Covenant-
breakers, solely for the purpose of turmoil, division and harm upon the
temple of the Cause of God and achieving their own purpose, had given
some of the divine verses and Tablets of the Blessed Perfection to the
mutisarrif of that era. After studying [these documents], the mutisarrif
summoned ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the government-house so he could ascertain
His objective.

In the blessed House of ‘Akká, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá described this
incident and stated in effect, “The mutisarrif brought out those divine
verses and Tablets, and inquired of the truth of the matter. I realized that
it was no longer time for wisdom, so I sat him down and commenced
teaching him the Faith. The mutisarrif accepted and attained unto
certitude.”

Towards the end of his life, Siyyid Mihdí Dahají had also given
some of the verses of the Blessed Beauty to ‘Akká’s muftí.

In short, all the harms of their evil machinations returned to
themselves. They were all obliterated and expunged, and their existence
became nonexistent.

[Neutralizing the Enemies]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá – may the spirit of all sincere friends be a sacrifice unto His
footsteps – used to say to this effect, “When someone harms my Person,
I forgive him. However, when their harm impacts the Cause of God,
then I will not pardon.”

During the blessed days of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, a person in Egypt was
the leader of a band of men, and would provoke these men against the
Bahá’ís of Egypt, and for this reason had brought about difficulties. One
day that same person arrived in Haifa from Egypt. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
summoned him. After the man entered into ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence, He
said to him, “You are causing injury to my community.” Then he was the
recipient of warnings, admonishments and several slaps.

After he left [the room], immediately he was summoned once
more. He thought to himself that perchance the page had turned [and
this time ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would be friendly to him], but it was not so since
upon his entrance, one more time, the same thing occurred and ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá picked up where He had left off.

When this man returned to Egypt, he gave unequivocal, emphatic
and decisive command to that band and emphasized, “You should not
show any malice towards this community [i.e. Bahá’ís], as no one can
defeat their Chief [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]; He is most powerful and able.”

It was then that the Bahá’ís of Egypt were freed from his mischief.

One time, He [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] stated, “With some people, a
thousand counsels and admonishments would not have the same effect
as a slap.”

At all events, in different forms and taking <p.255> different
shapes, many such occurrences would take place – so many that they
remain unnumbered and uncountable. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, while extremely
meek, was the zenith of power and grandeur.

[Chanting]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “If voice-recording had been available during
the days of the Blessed Beauty, I would have recorded His voice.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá was not pleased with the chanting of some Iranians
who, while reciting prayers, excessively extended [the final syllable]. This
was especially true of the chant of the divine verses and prayers since it
diminished the condition of spirituality and the effect of the prayer. He
would also say to this effect, “Some are consumed in their own singing
and this causes the effect [of God’s words] to be reduced.”

His point was that divine verses must be recited with the finest
voice.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá praised the chanting of the Qur’an in the Egyptian
dialect. Moreover, He would say, “If someone reads Arabic well, then I
allow him to recite verses of the Blessed Beauty in the gatherings of non-
Bahá’ís.” Sometimes this would occur and the listeners would be
thoroughly enchanted and enkindled.

[Colophon]
Presently, I conclude my memoirs at this point. With Bahá’í greetings,
this servant’s recollections and reminiscences were written in Tehran,
and concluded on the first day of ‘Ilm of the year one-hundred and
twenty-two Badí [corresponding to 16 October 1965].

Author’s Supplement

[The following supplemental materials appear after a page of comments by the Iranian
Bahá’í Publishing Committee (cited in the Translator’s Foreword). It appears that
after the Publishing Committee had expressed interest in publishing Shahídí’s
narrative and prepared the text for this purpose by editing it, it had decided to ask the
narrator to offer supplemental recollections and placed these additional materials at the
end.142 Translator.]

[Divine Confirmations]
During the time that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá resided and was established in ‘Akká,
one year it did not rain in that region. The inhabitants of that area
became deeply perturbed and distressed. For this reason, they
commenced prayers and supplications in mosques and other places of
worship. However, these entreaties remained unanswered [by God].

One day, a contingent of prominent non-Bahá’ís came into the
presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and expressed their considerable anxieties.
Among them was a man whose only daughter had recently died, and he
was passing his days with a heart filled with sorrow and grief. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá stated to that group words to this effect, “If this person was to
arise and offer obligatory prayers, in view of the fact that he is
brokenhearted, then God would accept his plea.”

After hearing this, he immediately rose, performed his ablutions
and in the presence of the entire congregation carried out the obligatory
prayer and supplications. At that moment, the weather changed, with
clouds filling the sky, and immediately rain began to pour.

This incident – like so many other similar occurrences that remain
unnumbered and untold – increased the wonder and astonishment of

142Further evidence that this section was a later addition include: (1) the page
numbers are different from the main document and only each sheet has been given
a sequential page number; and (2) there is no evidence that the Publishing
Committee edited this supplemental section.

those in attendance. It is because of this that it is revealed in the hadith
[Islamic traditions], “What we do comes from the will of God.”143

After the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá – may my spirit be a sacrifice
unto His remains – the child of one of the ladies, who was a follower of
His Holiness the Spirit [Jesus] and lived in Haifa, became severely ill to
the point that everyone had lost hope of his recovery and life.

One day, wailing, sobbing and crying, she came by the Shrine of
the Exalted One and with her fists began to repeatedly and loudly pound
on the door, shouting, begging and pleading, “O ‘Abbás Effendi, I
implore my son from Thee!” At the same time, she continued to cry
intensely, kissing and caressing that Edifice.

At last, in the same condition, she returned home. Upon arrival,
she saw her child was sitting in the bed and through God’s bounties and
benevolence had regained his health. In that instant, she raised her hands
heavenwards and thanked God that, sanctified be the Lord, her prayers
and supplications had found such ready and immediate acceptance at His
door of holiness.

[Avoidance of Tobacco]
One night ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was in the blessed House of ‘Akká and the
friends were in His blessed presence. In that gathering, a small quantity
of snuff reached His blessed nostrils, but with the utmost delicacy.144

143 The quoted hadith seems to be a corrupted form of a tradition cited by
Bahá’u’lláh (Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 112), “As to the Bayán, it consisteth in thy
recognition of God – glorified be He – as the One Who hath no equal, and in thy
adoration of Him, and in thy refusal to join partners with Him. As to the Ma‘ání,
We are its meaning, and its side, and its hand, and its tongue, and its cause, and its
command, and its knowledge, and its right. If We wish for something, it is God
Who wisheth it, and He desireth that which We desire.” Moreover, another hadith
of the same type is quoted in Muhammad-Báqi Majlisí, Biharu’l-Anwar, vol. 26, p. 14:
‫ ﻓﻨﺤﻦ ﻧﻔﻌﻞ‬، ‫ اﺧﺘﺮﻋﻨﺎ ﻣﻦ ﻧﻮر ذاﺗﻪ وﻓﻮض إﻟﻴﻨﺎ أﻣﻮر ﻋﺒﺎدﻩ‬، ‫وأﻣﺎ اﻟﻤﻌﺎﻧﻲ ﻓﻨﺤﻦ ﻣﻌﺎﻧﻴﻪ وﻣﻈﺎهﺮﻩ ﻓﻴﻜﻢ‬
‫ وإذا أردﻧﺎ أراد اﷲ‬، ‫ وﻧﺤﻦ إذا ﺷﺌﻨﺎ ﺷﺎء اﷲ‬، ‫( ﺑﺎذﻧﻪ ﻣﺎ ﻧﺸﺎء‬Omid Ghaemmaghami, Private
Communication, 1 January 2008.)
144 Snuff is a type of smokeless tobacco. There are several types used in different

ways. Traditionally Dry (or European) nasal snuff is inhaled, or snuffed, through the
nose and is a form of insufflation.

That is, like someone inhaling the fragrance of a flower – even more
delicate. He stated, “A small amount is beneficial. But too much will
cause dryness of the nose.”

However, this servant did not witness another occasion of such
use [by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá].

The point was that the snuff removes the vapor and heaviness of
the head, but it is conditioned on the use of a small amount. That is, it
should not be used in such a way as would cause addiction in a person.

Nevertheless, the principle intent of His blessed Person in so
doing was to emphasize the ill and loss due to this usage, so that the
friends of God would remain sanctified and pure from every direction.

[Morality versus Expediency]
During the blessed days of the Guardian of the Cause of God, one of
the Bahá’ís of Iran, whose job was in a governmental office and who was
thoroughly an expert in discharging his duties, wrote a missive [to Shoghi
Effendi] and therein described his situation and that of those wishing ill
upon the Cause of God.

The entire letter explained that the authorities in his department
were insisting that he should forego his religion and convictions, or at
least conceal and hide them, since they needed his person [for the
department to function]. However, they were seeing no results from
their insistence except disappointment. For this reason, they had read the
poem of Sa‘dí to him:

> “A well-intended lie is admitted to be preferable to a
> seditious truth.”145

145Sa‘dí (1213-1292) is nom de plume of Musharrifu’d-Dín ibn Muslihu’d-Dín. Born in
Shiraz, he is one of the greatest figures in classical Persian literature. The cited poem
comes from one of his best-known works, Gulistán (1258; The Rose Garden), which is
mainly in beautifully crafted prose and contains stories and personal anecdotes. The
text is interspersed with a variety of short, eloquent poems, containing aphorisms,
advice, and humorous reflections. The morals preached in the Gulistán border on
expediency.

That is, they implied, “Ascribe to whatever religion you wish, but
speak this lie out of expediency.”

In short, after the arrival of this missive, one day the beloved
Guardian of the Cause of God was at the pilgrim house of the Shrine of
the Exalted One [the Báb]. That day was a day of general visitation. That
supplication was in his blessed pocket. It was read in accordance with his
instructions and the friends of God heard its contents. After a short
pause, the Guardian stated, “They are resorting and clinging to the
corroded sayings of Sa‘dí.” He immediately rose and proceeded to the
Shrine of the Exalted One for visitation.146

From His statement it could be discerned that the very standard
and balance for humanity will be the heavenly utterances and divine
teachings, and nothing else, and will remain so forever, particularly as it
relates to matters pertaining to God and morality.

[Souls]
One night a gathering of the friends of God was assembled in the
blessed House of ‘Akká in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence. This bounty was
also bestowed on this servant. He was speaking regarding the soul of the
deceased, including words to this effect, “In consideration of the
attraction and connection that the soul has had with the body, for forty
days the soul visits that location and spot [of burial].”147

[Penmanship]
<p.260> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá used to say, “Handwriting must be legible.”

His blessed purpose was that the prime importance is legibility of
writings. However, it is certain that if something is written with exquisite
penmanship, then it is the very perfection.

146 In 1985, ‘Alí Nakhjavání shared a description of the same incident with the
present translator. However, he recalled, “Shoghi Effendi stated, ‘With one verse,
Sa‘dí destroyed the moral foundation of the Iranian people.’”
147 A similar sentiment is expressed in the Persian Bayán, 5:12.

[Daily Livelihood]
One time, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke about daily livelihood. Included in His
utterances was the essence of the following: “If a person conducts
himself in accordance with God’s teachings, then he should never worry
about his daily bread, as somehow it will be made available to him.”

His purpose was that a person’s success in all matters – including
his daily bread, which is made available to every living thing – is
conditioned and dependent upon his obedience to the divine laws and
ordinances, and nothing else.

[Commemoration Periods]
It was inquired of the presence of the Guardian of the Cause, “By the
difference of how many days should the observances, commemorations
and festivals that occur before or after the memorial and solemn Days148
of the Cause be held?” He replied, “By a difference of ten days before
and after.”

His blessed purpose was that out of respect, at least ten days [of
separation] is required. In truth, it is a bounty for the people of Bahá that
he did not decree and fix more days than this.149

148 It appears that the Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh and the martyrdom of the Báb are
intended here; and it may include the commemoration of the passing of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá.
149 Shoghi Effendi’s comments regarding the date of Bahá’í Holy Days are further

explored in Appendix 5.

Bahá’u’lláh’s Lawh Istiqámat

[The narrator cited Bahá’u’lláh’s Lawh Istiqámat [Tablet of Constancy] in the text
and Mark Costine has graciously prepared a provisional translation. The original
text is found in La’álí Hikmat, vol. 1, pp. 113-14,
http://reference.bahai.org/fa/t/b/LH1/lh1-112.html ]

He is the Holy, the Most Glorious.

O ye servants of the Merciful One! We admonish you to observe
trustworthiness, truthfulness and faithfulness, and to manifest the fear of
God, the Mighty, the Wise. Verily, he who holdeth fast to the fear of
God is accounted among those who occupy this sublime station. Your
eyes have been solaced, O people of Bahá, by gazing upon My Realm of
glory, and blessed are your ears for they have been honored by
hearkening unto the Verses of God, the Lord of the worlds. Appreciate
ye the value of this exalted station. By My life! The treasuries of the
heavens and of the earth can never hope to match it.

Verily the glances of God’s loving-kindness are cast upon you. He
heareth what ye speak in your love for Him and seeth what ye encounter
in the path of the all-compelling Cause of the All-Wise. He truly
remembereth you from His habitation in the Most Great Prison,
inasmuch as your names are written and preserved in the Guarded
Tablet. Say: By God! Each and every thing is a messenger of joy unto
you at all times, did ye but know.

Ye must be constant, exceedingly constant, so that your feet shall
not slip in the Straight Path. Say: This is My mightiest commandment
and My greatest charge upon you and amidst you. Heed ye it, then set it
before your eyes, and God is a witness unto what I say. In My Tablet,
My Scroll, My Scriptures, My Treatises and My Books, I verily have
admonished My loved ones, who soar in My atmosphere and who drink
the wine of Mine utterance, to observe the most perfect constancy. To

this testify My pen, Mine ink, My finger, My hand, Mine arm, Mine ear,
Mine eye, My hairs, My limbs and My truth-telling tongue.

Time and again We have mentioned this weightiest of themes, so
much so that My most exalted Pen hath addressed Me while moving
between My fingers, saying “O Thou Who art wronged and imprisoned
and the Guardian of the hidden and the known! I see that the ocean of
Thine intent is turning towards this word which Thou hast made the
foundation of Thy most exalted words in the station of remembrance in
the realm of creation. The glory of Thy might beareth me witness! I am
perplexed by this, O King of eternity, and truly Thou art the All-
Knowing, the All-Informed. I beseech Thee to remove the veil from the
face of mine understanding and to enable me to recognize Thy purpose,
O Thou the Desire of the World. {Can it be possible that after the
dawning of the day-star of Thy Testament above the horizon of Thy
Most Great Tablet, the feet of any-one shall slip in Thy Straight Path?”

Unto this We answered: “O My most exalted Pen! It behooveth
Thee to occupy Thyself with that whereunto Thou hast been bidden by
God, the Exalted, the Great. Ask not of that which will consume Thy
heart and the hearts of the denizens of Paradise, who have circled round
My wondrous Cause. It behooveth Thee not to be acquainted with that
which We have veiled from Thee. Thy Lord is, verily, the Concealer, the
All-Knowing!}150 Turn thou thy most radiant face toward the Most
Sublime Vision and say, ‘O my God, the Most Merciful! Adorn the
heaven of utterance with the stars of constancy, trustworthiness,
truthfulness and faithfulness. Verily, potent art Thou to do what Thou
willest. There is no God but Thee, the Ruler, the Beneficent.’”

Bahá’u’lláh on the Next Manifestation

[Portion of a Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh in which He refers to the next Manifestation was
cited by the narrator. This Tablet can be found in ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Ishráq-Khávarí,
Má’idih Ásimání, vol. 4, pp. 92-94. The full Text is provided below for ease of
reference as a provisional translation. Translator.]

This very moment was I summoned before the Throne.151 He
[Bahá’u’lláh] inquired, “With what wast thou occupied?” I submitted, “I
was writing answers to the objections raised by the infernal temple.”152
Thus spoke the Tongue of God:

Write:

> “Hast thou not heard that My proof is My essence, My
> evidence, My person, and My argument is My

passage is revealed.
152 Haykal jahím, rendered as infernal temple, is most likely a reference to Mírzá Yahyá

Azal. It appears that Mírzá Áqá Ján was engaged in responding to objections raised
by Mírzá Yahyá in a letter sent to the Holy Land by one of the believers. From the
Tablet it may be inferred that the chief objection raised was that Mírzá Yahyá had
advanced his claim to leadership by revealing verses. It is with this specific claim
that Bahá’u’lláh is concerned here and sets out to refute.

Here end the words of God, the Peerless, the Wondrous, the
Unique.

Appendix 3

Bahá’u’lláh’s Utterance

[Under the section “The Next Manifestation,” Khalíl Shahídí cited a passage from a
Tablet of Bahá’u’lláh, which read in part: “For in this Manifestation, God –
glorified be His mention – hath willed that most of the believers and the sincere ones
should give utterance to Verses.” Perhaps as an exposition on this theme, the
following extract from Fádil Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 5, pp. 25-
26, is provided. Translator.]

Nabíl Zarandí has narrated some of the oral utterances of the Blessed
Beauty [Bahá’u’lláh], spoken in those days [in Edirne].

“While I was in the presence [of Bahá’u’lláh] with a number of others in
the house of ‘Izzat Áqá, I heard the Blessed Tongue speak these words:

> Since We were well-known among all the ministers of Iran,
> they would all exhibit friendship towards Us. However, they
> were afraid lest the government would issue a grave order
> against Us. Since the governor of Tehran had heard of the
> incident of Badasht that a group [of the Bábís] had been
> with Us, he took an oath, “Many times I have heard various
> accounts about Him [Bahá’u’lláh], but I have overlooked
> them. However, next time, of a certainty I will slay Him.”
> He ordered the khans [local chieftains] in Mazandaran to
> arrest and punish Us. However, his majesty the king
intervened.

Later on, the Amír-Nizám said in the assemblage of
> the nobles, “He [Bahá’u’lláh] has brought much harm upon
> the government. But, nevertheless, He resides in Tehran in
the utmost splendor.”

It was a perilous time. Many of the nobles were urging
Me to journey [away from Tehran] in a different direction.

> However, I considered all of these talks to be drivel, since
> God desired to manifest His Cause and it was not possible
> for any harm to come to Me until the Cause had been made
> manifest, or for the Almighty not to protect Me in midst of
calamities.

However, from another direction, in consideration of
> divine wisdom, We empowered the tongue of a few others
> to speak Wondrous Words so that people’s attention would
> be diverted elsewhere and before its appointed time, none
> would become aware of the Source. One of those people
> was the honored [Mírzá] Munír [Káshání], whose words
> were preferred over the words of Yahyá [Azal]. However, in
> publicizing the name Yahyá, and speaking about him in his
> absence, Our intention was for the people of the Bayán to
> focus their attention on the house wherein God’s Purpose
> was concealed. And the intention of His Holiness the
> Exalted One [the Báb] by proclaiming the naming of Azal
> was the same, but He styled him as one of the mirrors and
> He exalted the Letters of the Living – of whom Mullá Hasan
Bajistání was one – over the mirrors.

Moreover, He [the Báb] instructed the most
> renowned of the believers [Bahá’u’lláh] to educate Yahyá.
> For years, We busied Yahyá with writing the Words of God
> and the Verses of the Lord. He wrote them in Our presence
> and We encouraged him, and corrected whatever he wrote.
> He commenced writing from the age of twenty, but never
> were his writings without errors, both in the material and
spiritual meanings.

However, the honored Munír wrote Wondrous Words
> without having had the benefit of tuition from Us and
> without needing any corrections. If Yahyá had a jot of
> equity, he would consider the presence of Munír as a
> complete proof [of Our influence], since he saw that in both
> Baghdad and Edirne, Munír’s words were the essence of
> power, and composed without any pauses.

In view of the Will of His Holiness the Exalted One,
> it was binding upon Yahyá that should someone like him
> [Munir] appear in his days, then he should hand the Cause
> to him.

The Suicide of Abú’l-Hasan Afnán

[In the section “Mírzá Abu’l-Hasan Afnán”, the narrator recounted the story of the
Afnán who committed suicide on hearing ‘Abdu’l-Bahá foretell of His own passing in
a few days. The following materials expand on this poignant story. Transliteration of
names has been adjusted in conformity with the rest of this monograph. Translator.]

yet made public, he clearly stated in regard to his departure.

My dear uncle:

Oh! what a calamity has befallen us by the departure
of our beloved Master.

Several times in meetings during the year, up to the

happening. I do not say anything.”

> Such words were uttered by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá many times.

A certain person was such a great stumbling block in

to work, read and write.”

To begin with, he dismissed Mírzá Azízu’lláh Bahádur

Bahá’í Holy Days

In the section “Commemoration Periods”, the Guardian’s comments
about the observance of Bahá’í Holy Days were recorded by the
narrator. While the details of the Bahá’í calendar system will be legislated
by the Universal House of Justice in due time, the following research
note is offered as an exploration of this subject.

The Bahá’í Holy Days consist of 9 days (given below in no
particular order):

> 1.   Birth of Bahá’u’lláh
> 2.   Birth of the Báb
> 3.   First day of Ridván
> 4.   Ninth day of Ridván
> 5.   Twelfth day of Ridván
> 6.   Declaration of the Báb
> 7.   Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh
> 8.   Martyrdom of the Báb
> 9.   Naw-Rúz

In determining the date of observance of these Holy Days, we are
aided by the following Tablet by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá addressed to Áqá Shaykh
Muhsin in Hamadan:155

> Regarding observances [of Holy Days] in this mighty
> Dispensation, some are by the solar and others by the lunar
calendar.

The Ridván festivity, the Naw-Rúz celebration and the
> night of Ascension [of Bahá’u’lláh] are observed according
> to the solar calendar.

155   Ishráq-Khávarí, Ganjínih Hudúd va Ahkám, p. 426.

However, in accordance with an explicit text, the twin
> blessed Birthdays [of Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb] are observed
> consecutively, and this cannot be except by their observance
in accordance to lunar reckoning.156

During the blessed days [of Bahá’u’lláh], the
> declaration of His Holiness the Exalted One – may My spirit
> be a sacrifice unto Him – and the martyrdom of His
> Holiness the Primal Point were observed in accordance with
> lunar calculations. However, this has not been explicitly
> stated in the Kitáb-i Aqdas.

Therefore, according to this explicit exposition by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
the date of 7 (out of 9) Holy Days are fixed. That is, it can be concluded
that Ridván (3 Holy Days), Naw-Rúz and the Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh
are by solar calendar, while the twin Births are to be observed based on
lunar calculations.

Of the remaining two Holy Days, namely, the Declaration and the
Martyrdom of the Báb, the observance of one of them has been clarified
by the following statement of Bahá’u’lláh:

> 36. QUESTION: If the anniversary either of the Twin
> Birthdays or of the Declaration of the Báb occurreth during
> the Fast, what is to be done?
> ANSWER: Should the feasts celebrating the Twin Birthdays
> or the Declaration of the Báb fall within the month of
> fasting, the command to fast shall not apply on that day.157

156 The explicit text referred to by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá appears to be the following
statement in Questions and Answers (Bahá’u’lláh, The Kitáb-i Aqdas, p. 105):

> 2. QUESTION: Concerning the Festival of the Twin Birthdays.
> ANSWER: The Birth of the Abhá Beauty was at the hour of dawn on
> the second day of the month of Muharram, the first day of which
> marketh the Birth of His Herald. These two days are accounted as
> one in the sight of God.

157 Bahá’u’lláh, The Kitáb-i Aqdas, p. 118.

From the above statement, it is clear that the only reason why the
Declaration of the Báb would coincide with the fast season would be for
it to be observed on a lunar basis.

That leaves only the Martyrdom of the Báb. There are reasons to
believe that this Holy Day is to be observed according to solar
reckoning. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in a Tablet to Mírzá Qábil Ábádih’í states the
following:158

> You had written about the Day of Declaration of His
> Holiness the Exalted One – may My soul be a sacrifice unto
> Him, which is mentioned in Questions and Answers. This
> occurred on the day of kamál of the month of ‘Azamat,159
> and the day of Martyrdom took place on the day of sultan of
> the month of Rahmat.160 This is an explicit text and nothing
> may conflict with explicit texts. Later it will be followed as
such.

However, during the blessed days [of Bahá’u’lláh],
> these two sacred days were observed on the fifth of
> Jamádu’l-Avval and the twenty-eighth of Sha‘bán, and the
> friends used to gather in the Hallowed Presence [of
> Bahá’u’lláh]. On the Day of Declaration, He would express
> His joy, and on the Day of Martyrdom would express
> sadness, to the point that a profound effect was evident on
> His sanctified Countenance. Therefore, we also observe
those two occasions on the same dates.

However, what has been written explicitly will take
place in the future …161

Regarding the twin Birthdates, the explicit text states
that they occur on the first and the second of Muharram.

158 Ishráq-Khávarí, Ganjínih Hudúd va Ahkám, pp. 426-427.
159 ‘Azamat [Grandeur] is the fourth Bahá’í month and starts on 17 May. Kamál is
the eighth day of the month. Therefore, the reference here is to 24 May.
160 Rahmat [Mercy] is the sixth Bahá’í month and starts on 24 June. Sultán is the

seventeenth day of the month. Therefore, the reference here is to 10 July.
161 A portion not cited in Ishráq-Khávarí, Ganjínih Hudúd va Ahkám, p. 427.

If the above analysis is correct, then the following summary could
be concluded:

> Birth of Bahá’u’lláh                             Lunar
> Birth of the Báb                                 Lunar
> First day of Ridván                              Solar
> Ninth day of Ridván                              Solar
> Twelfth day of Ridván                            Solar
> Declaration of the Báb                           Solar162
> Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh                         Solar
> Martyrdom of the Báb                             Solar
> Naw-Rúz                                          Solar

Inasmuch as this analysis concludes that both the Martyrdom of
the Báb and the Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh will be observed by the solar
reckoning (and these are the only two solemn Holy Days), and three
joyous occasions, namely the Births of the Twin Manifestations and the
Declaration of the Báb, are observed on lunar basis and move
throughout the year, then it appears that the question put to Shoghi
Effendi (as reported in the section “Commemoration Periods”) requires
further legislations by the House of Justice. That is, it appears that
Shoghi Effendi did not wish for the solemn Holy Days to come within
10 days of joyous Days, but how this is to be reconciled and reflected in
actual Bahá’í calendar remains a matter for the House of Justice’s
consideration.

162 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement that the Declaration of the Báb will be observed in the
future on solar basis appears to contradict Bahá’u’lláh’s injunction in Questions and
Answers. However, the system of Bahá’í interpretative law requires that all
differences between Bahá’u’lláh’s and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statements be settled in favor
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, as the authorized interpreter of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá on Persepolis

[A summary of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s remarks about Persepolis (in Persian commonly
referred to as Takht Jamshíd), was given by the narrator in the text. This appears to
be a summation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s talk given on Sunday, 18 July 1915. Two
versions of this talk are known to the present translator: (1) Mírzá Badí‘ Bushrú’í,
Nuzdah Sál Shádmání, manuscript in private hands, pp. 92-94,163 and (2)
‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Ishráq-Khávarí, Rahiq Makhtúm, vol. 2, pp. 499-502. Without
citing its source, Rahiq Makhtúm appears to be quoting the eyewitness account of
Bushrú’í, which is used as the source text for the present rendering.

Persepolis was an ancient ceremonial capital of the Persian Empire. It was
built during the reign of Cyrus the Great around 560 BC. This vast and majestic
complex is situated some 70 km northeast of Shiraz. To ancient Iranians, the city
was known as Parsa, meaning The City of Persians, Persepolis being the Greek
interpretation of the name Pars.

Bushrú’í explains that in the morning, one of the German residents of Haifa,
Dr. Finkelstein, attained the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Afterwards, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
went to the pilgrim house and someone remarked, “Most of the homes in the upper
section have their doors shut.” The text below is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s response.
Translator.]
163 The present translator is grateful to Adel Shafipour for pointing out this
reference.

If someone goes to Takht Jamshíd [Persepolis], he will see how homes
are shut. There is no building that has not been destroyed. As expansive
as it was, Takht Jamshíd was destroyed and made into ruins. In
comparison, these present buildings are nothing.

When they say that Jamshíd raised this edifice [Persepolis], it is
frivolous talk. Takht Jamshíd was built by Gushtásb,164 Isfandiyár,165 and
Dará. This edifice was raised by them. However, its details are very
involved; few structures are found with such grandeur.

This edifice was located on the skirts of a mountain and had
several levels. A barrier was built in front of it ten meters high.

164   King Vishtaspa was the first Zoroastrian monarch of Iran.
165   Spendodata succeeded his father, King Vishtaspa.

Two sets of stairs flung out on each side: one on the right, and one
on the left. Each of these stairways were sixty feet [long]. However, they
were most amazing. Each step was a chárak wide and a girih high.166
When one reached the top of the stairs, one turned to the right, which is
sixty feet long, and then left, which is another fifty feet, for a total of one
hundred and ten feet. Similarly with the stairs on the left: sixty feet to the
left and fifty feet to the right. These stairs were built in such a way that a
person’s feet would not bend. With utmost ease, horses could go up and
down these steps.

When one reached the top [of these stairs], a platform appeared
that was 470 meters long and 290 meters wide. It is an expansive
platform. At the end of this platform, Gushtasb built an entrance that
had four pillars. On these pillars were [the statues of] four beasts: their
body was the body of a bull, and their head like the head of a man. They
had wings. Behind these statues, the platform sloped high for nine
meters. This corridor led to the royal hall that had forty pillars. This
building was initiated by Gushtasb and completed by Isfandiyar. In a
similar manner, the steps are short in height.

When you reached the top, there was the forty-pillar building. The
pillars were wide and tall. However, they were not made of a single
stone; rather, they were in three parts. Nevertheless, they were so well
fused that they appeared seamless.
166 A chárak is equivalent to one-fourth of a dar‘, which in turn is about one meter. A
girih is one-fourth of a chárak, or about one-sixteenth of a meter.

After this forty-pillar building, one reached the building raised by
Dará. It had many halls. For instance, its entrance gate was made of
three stones and two main pillars. The walls were made of such stones
that even today they shine like a mirror. They were so refined that one
could see oneself in them.

But, alas, it was destroyed. Most of the pillars have fallen. Of the
forty pillars, only thirteen remain standing. Besides this forty-pillar hall,
there was another building with one hundred pillars – most expansive.

When a person passed this [building] and ascended the short
mountain, at the top there was a dakhmih,167 which in its outer structure
was made with pillars. After this portico, there was a dakhmih where the
dead were placed. On the walls of this building, they have carved faces.
They have made statues [from the stones] of the mountain itself.

167Dakhmih was a circular building where the Zoroastrians laid the bodies of their
dead.

In the Gushtasb building, many pictures have been engraved on
either side of the stairs. The stones in the Gushtasb structure were each
two meters wide and of the same length. Many faces have been carved
on the walls: the faces of kings and soldiers, with some holding shields
and others spears. Also faces of farmers, artisans and shopkeepers.

On the walls, they have written in cuneiform, which was read by a
German. He traveled in Iran for many years and worked hard until
eventually he was able to decipher them. At first, he was unable to read
them, but found a piece of paper in Greece, which gave a translation of
cuneiform into the Pahlavi language beneath each word. By comparing
the letters, he was able to read the cuneiform inscriptions, since
cuneiform, the Pahlavi and Zand [languages] stem from the same Aryan
root. That is, they are from the same branch [of languages] and were
close to one another. Therefore, aided by this [decoding] paper, the
German was able to decipher the cuneiform in Takht Jamshíd.

In short, in cuneiform they have written who constructed this
building. People say that it was Jamshíd who built this structure, but this
is not true. Jamshíd lived five thousand years ago.

One of these pillars was brought to Paris and displayed in a
museum. At the top of the pillar were two bull heads, upon which the
building was built.

In truth, what amazing monuments Iran had! What a civilization it
possessed!

The Persian nations have written on these stones, “I am Darius,
the king of kings. By the favor of Ahura Mazda,168 I have raised this

168Ahura Mazda is the Avestan language name for a divinity exalted by Zoroaster as
the one uncreated Creator, hence God.

building. I have conquered the nations of Iran, Egypt, Greece, and
India” – and other nations that he named.169

Now Iranians in this age have brought down their nation from the
height of such grandeur to this misery and ruin, and are still conspiring
in the destruction of their nation. In truth, what ignorance can do!

I cherish the hope that Iran will become even mightier than her
past and that they would build a magnificent Mashriqu’l-Adhkar in Takht
Jamshíd. May Takht Jamshíd be developed even better than before and
be built in its original design and a Mashriqu’l-Adhkar be raised there
too. However, this must be done on the same foundation, and built in

169   Part of the inscription shown on this page reads:

> I am Darius the great king, the king of kings, the king of many
> countries, the son of Hystaspes, an Achaemenid.
> By the favor of Ahuramazda these are the countries which I got into
> my possession along with this Persian people, which felt fear of me
> and bore me tribute : Elam, Media, Babylonia, Arabia, Assyria, Egypt,
> Armenia, Cappadocia, Lydia, the Greeks who are of the mainland and
> those who are by the sea, and countries which are across the sea,
> Sagartia, Parthia, Drangiana, Aria, Bactria, Sogdia, Chorasmia,
> Sattagydia, Arachosia, Hinduš, Gandara, Sacae, Maka.

the exact form it had in the ancient days. This must be completed. In
addition, a Mashriqu’l-Adhkar must be instituted. …170

170The remainder of this talk is unrelated to Persepolis and as such has been left
untranslated in the present monograph.
