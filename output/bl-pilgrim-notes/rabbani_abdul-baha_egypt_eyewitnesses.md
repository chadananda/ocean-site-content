Editor’s Foreword

Introduction
It was Bahá’u’lláh Who from Edirne in the mid 1860s encouraged several
Bahá’í merchants to settle in Alexandria and Cairo, thus opening Egypt to
His Faith. Among this group were Hájí Báqir and Siyyid Husayn, two natives
of Kashan, who took up residence in Egypt.1 Bahá’u’lláh also sent Hájí Mullá
‘Alí Tabrízí, Hájí Muhammad Yazdí and Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí Isfahání to that
region and they lived in Mansuriyya, where they converted a number of
people, including Hájí Abú’l-Qásim Shírází.2 In 1888, at the instigation of the
Iranian Consulate, the Khedive Ismá‘íl Pasha deported Isfahání to Sudan.3
However, other Bahá’í merchants from Iran arrived and by early 1890s a
sizeable Bahá’í community was flourishing in several towns, including Port
Said, which were led by Áqá Mírzá Áqá Núri’d-Dín and Mírzá Hasan
Khurásání.4

The arrival in 1894 of Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl Gulpáygání (1844-1914), a
renowned scholar who had converted to the Bahá’í Faith after receiving
training as a Muslim seminarian, reinforced the Bahá’í community in Egypt.
He started lecturing at Al-Azhar University and soon a large circle of
students surrounded him. He taught philosophy, logic, history, dialectical
theology (kalam), Qur’an commentary, and geography. He gained the trust
of some of his Sunni students and soon was able to win many of them to
the Faith.5 This first influx of native Egyptian intellectuals into the religion
gives evidence both of the appeal of the Bahá’í teachings for this group and
the persuasiveness of Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl himself.

In 1896, an assassin, who was a disciple of Jamálu’d-Dín Afghání,
killed Nasiri'd-Dín Shah. Both in Iran and among Iranian expatriates, many
blamed the Bábís for this incident (few Iranians at that time, or even at the
present, made any distinction between Bábís and Bahá’ís). Until official
word came from Iran through the Consulate that the Bahá’ís were not
involved, a number of Shi‘at Iranian expatriates were calling for a retaliatory
massacre of the Bahá’ís in Egypt. It was during this period that at a
gathering in the Iranian Consulate, Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl openly declared himself
to be a Bahá’í. He had by this time established contacts with the Egyptian

press. When news reports containing charges that the Bábís were behind
the Shah’s assassination began to circulate, Ya‘qub Sarruf and Farís Nimr
asked Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl for an article on the Bábí and Bahá’í movements for
their secular-minded journal, al-Muqtataf. Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl complied, and as
such brought the history and teachings of the Faith to the attention of
intellectuals throughout the Arab world.

During this period, a number of early treatises were published in
Cairo, including: an Arabic polemical history of the Bábís by Mírzá
Muhammad-Mihdí Khán, the Za’ímu’d-Dawlih, was printed in Cairo in 19036;
numerous titles in Persian, including collection of Tablets, prayers and
poetries of Bahá’u’lláh, His Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, The Seven
Valleys, The Four Valleys; three volumes of Makátíb [Letters] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá;
Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl’s Kitáb Fará’id, Dawra’l-Bahiyyih, and Hujaju’l-Bahiyyih; and
Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí’s Dalá’ilu’l-‘Irfán. Publications in Arabic included
Bahá’u’lláh’s Ishráqát, Tajallíát, Tarázát, and Kalamát. Myron H. Phelps
completed his work, Life and Teachings of Abbas Effendi, when in Cairo in
March 1903.

In addition, starting 1899, Egypt had become a transit point for
Western Bahá’ís coming to and from the Holy Land for their visit to the
Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, and attaining the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

Against this backdrop, we find ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to Egypt. The
years following Bahá’u’lláh’s Ascension, brought intense pressure on
‘Abdu’l-Bahá instigated by his unfaithful half-brothers. For the first five
years, He tried to conceal the actions of Mírzá ‘Alí-Muhammad and other
siblings in undermining His authority and bringing about divisions, but their
own deeds finally brought their rebellion into open. They continued with
their constant harassments and machinations against ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, but the
latter pressed ahead with developments both within the Holy Land and
elsewhere. In Haifa, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá supervised the construction of the Shrine
of the Báb and establishment of a larger Bahá’í community in Haifa, which
also included His own residence and family. In 1904 in Iran, He encouraged
the immediate reconstruction of the House of the Báb in Shiraz, to the
same design that it was during the time of the Báb. He continued to guide
the ever-expanding Bahá’í community of ‘Ishqabad and under His directions,
the first Mashriqu’l-Adhkar was raised there. In the United States, land was
purchased and dedicated for the first Temple in the West. Bahá’í
communities were established in a number of towns in Europe and the
North America. And all during this time, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá endured the

\[6\] Miftáhu Bábí’l-Abwab [The Key to the Gate of Gates]. Supposedly this was a
dispassionate account of the Bábís and Bahá’ís, but in fact a distortion of truth, and in
effect, as attested by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, intended to arouse passions against the Bahá’ís.

investigation of two Commissions of Inquiry sent from Istanbul to ‘Akká as
result of Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí’s lies that he was spreading through local
officials. The second Commission’s visit, resulted in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
confinement in the city of ‘Akká.

But, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has described it, “God’s cannon roared” and the
Commission was withdrawn and His imprisonment ended. Soon after that,
as result of Revolution of the Young Turks, all political prisoners are
pardoned, including ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

On hearing that he was free, His first act was to visit the Shrine of
His Father since during the years of His incarceration, He had been denied
the opportunity to visit that Shrine and this weighed heavily upon Him. No
sooner was He at liberty to visit Bahjí than He resumed the task which He
had so diligently pursued in days past, namely, carrying water for the
gardens to that Sacred Spot every Friday and Sunday.

But now He was sixty-five years old, and His health was failing due to
years of hardships which He had endured. Resident Bahá’ís and pilgrim
begged ‘Abdu'l-Bahá to spare Himself physically difficult tasks, but He
thought it was important for Him to continue with all His services.

Subsequent to the entombment of the remains of the Báb on Mount
Carmel, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá transferred His residence to Haifa, where a house was
built for Him. Soon He ceased to set foot within the city gates of ‘Akká.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s health continued to decline. Sorrows and tribulations
pressed hard upon ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and weakened His frame and made Him a
prey to various ailments, which at times were severe. Physicians advised
Him that He ought to seek a change of air, and leave the region. “But
subsequent events demonstrated the fact that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, when He did
this, was not just embarking on a journey to improve His health in a
different setting, or to prevent its further deterioration. He was indeed
taking the first step to reach the world of the West and deliver, in person,
the Message of His Father. There was another purpose evident in ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s journey. Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí and his partisans were now thoroughly
discredited. In the absence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá from the Holy Land the violators
would have the field entirely to themselves, but their utter inability to make
any move to impair the unity of the Bahá’ís would set the final seal on their
downfall. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá particularly stressed this fact in a Tablet addressed
at the time to a Bahá'í of Iskandarun (Alexandretta).”7

‘Abdu’l-Baha stayed in Port Said for nearly a month. Once again,
without previous announcement He took a ship, first intending to go to
Europe, but it became obvious that the state of His health did not permit

\[7\] Hasan Balyuzi, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: The Centre of the Covenant, p. 133.

the strenuous journey. Instead He disembarked at Alexandria. Here a
complete change occurred and all the work of last two decades began to
pay off. Egyptian Journalists, who had until then shown open hostility,
began to ask for meetings with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and significantly changed their
tone and often wrote in terms of high praise. Shaykh ‘Alí-Yúsuf, the editor
of the Arabic paper, al-Mu’ayyad, had previously made harsh attacks on the
Bahá’ís, urging that they be severely constraint. He visited ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
in the October 16 issue of his paper he published an article under the
heading, “Al-Mírzá ‘Abbás Effendi.” “These are the opening lines of that
remarkable article: ‘His Eminence Mírzá ‘Abbás Effendi, the learned and
erudite Head of the Bahá’ís in ‘Akká and the Centre of authority for Bahá’ís
throughout the world, has reached the shores of Alexandria.’ At first,
related the writer, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stayed in the Victoria Hotel, but after a few
days moved to a rented house. Then he went on to say:

> He is a venerable person, dignified, possessed of profound
> knowledge, deeply versed in theology, master of the history of
> Islam, and of its denominations and developments . . . whosoever
> has consorted with Him has seen in Him a man exceedingly well-
> informed, Whose speech is captivating, Who attracts minds and
> souls, dedicated to belief in the oneness of mankind . . . His
> teaching and guidance revolve round the axis of relinquishing
> prejudices: religious, racial, patriotic.”8

Other newspaper editors visited him and had the same remarkable
transformation. This period of stay in Alexandria also coincided with the
month of Muharram, which is observed with great fervor, recalling the
tragedies befallen on Imam Husayn. ‘Abdu’l-Baha participated in these
observances and contributed to holding of commemorative meetings on His
behalf and to feeding the poor.

Early in May, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá moved to Cairo and took residence nearby
in Zaytun. As His stay in Egypt lengthened, newspapers showed increasing
friendliness. In Cairo, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was able to meet with many liberal
Islamic thinkers and win their support. During this stay, He also renewed His
friendship with Muhammad ‘Abduh, who had met Him in Beirut during the
1880s. The two had subsequently maintained a correspondence on the
subject of Islamic reform. On his return to Egypt, ‘Abduh was appointed
Grand Mufti and became a leading professor at Al-Azhar University. He
extended a particularly warm welcome to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Many other
notables, including many clerics, administrators, parliamentarians,

\[8\] Hasan Balyuzi, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: The Centre of the Covenant, pp. 136-37.

intellectuals, journalists, politicians, foreign dignitaries, and Arabs, Turks
and Persians, sought His presence as well and were deeply impressed by His
vision. The poor and the deprived also had access to Him and left satisfied.

His visit to Egypt a complete success, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá turned His
attention to Europe. On August 11, 1911, He boarded S.S. Corsica bound
for Marseilles, France.

Over the course of the next two years, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá visited many
major Bahá’í communities in Europe and North America – a story that is told
in great depth in other available sources.9

After completing His journeys, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá returned to Egypt at the
end of June 1913 and stayed until early October of that year. During these
two stays, He became quite well known and influential — as evidenced by
extensive press coverage in Egypt of his funeral in 1921. For Bahá’ís
around the world, the extended visits of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gives Egypt a special
significance.

Comments on the Present Volume
There is a large body of materials on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s stay in Egypt during
1910-11 and 1913, and much more to be gathered. The present volume is
only a small step in making some of these materials more accessible to
students of history.

The first section provides a series of extracts from Bahai News, which
was renamed Star of the West. These are all from the 1910-11 period.
Since these extracts used a system of transliteration no longer current
(often making the names difficult to recognize), all the eastern names were

\[9\] There are several volumes of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s talks in Europe, most important being Paris
Talks and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in London. Most of H talks in North America were collected as a
single book titled The Promulgation of Universal Peace. Though much has been written on
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visits to America, little has been published about His travels in Europe,
except such short accounts as “’Abdu’l-Bahá Meeting with Two Prominent Iranians”, or
pilgrim’s notes such as The Diary of Juliet Thompson. The most complete study of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s visit to North America, Allan L. Ward’s Two Hundred Thirty-Nine Days: ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s Journey in America, and a detailed chronicle of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s trip is provided in
Mírzá Mahmúd Zarqání’s, Mahmud’s Diary, vol. 1. Hasan Balyuzi’s ‘Abdu'l-Bahá: The Centre
of the Covenant, chapters 12-18, also provides a summary. Other sources include:
Memoirs by Thornton Chase and Juanita Storch about ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to North
America, describing the impact he had on Bahá’ís, (World Order, 25.1 (Fall, 1993)); The
Diary of Juliet Thompson also includes a wealth of information about his visits to America,
especially pages 223-395, and some of his time in Europe, especially pages 147-222;
Agnes Parsons’ ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in America: Agnes Parsons’ Diary, and the biography of Lua
Getsinger, Lua Getsinger: Herald of the Covenant, also cover much of the same ground.

edited to make them consistent with transliteration presently used in Bahá’í
publications. Several footnotes were added.

The    second     section   [not     included;   see    http://bahai-
library.com/sohrab_abdulbaha_egypt -J.W.] provides a detailed description
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s activities during the summer of 1913. The source used
here was Abdul Baha in Egypt by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab (New York: J. H.
Sears & Company, Inc., 1929). This publication was approved by the
Publishing Committee of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of
the United States and Canada, and the author’s dedication read, “There
records of the perfect life of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá are dedicated to His ever-present
spirit.” The Foreword to 1929 printing stated:

Around the great figures of the Prophets in all ages have
> been woven stories and records, often in the remote past clouded
> by myth and allegory, which nevertheless, constitute a witness to
the light.

In this age when the influence of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá is universally felt and their writings are being studied and
> translated into many languages, this intimate diary record should
meet with wide response.

Mírzá Ahmad Sohrab served for more than eight years as
> one of the private secretaries and interpreters of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; he
> accompanied him on his journey throughout the West in 1912
> and was with him during the World War. In this diary he has vividly
> portrayed certain aspects and events in, the daily life and
> surroundings of the “Master” not found elsewhere, thus adding a
> document of human interest and appeal to the ever expanding
literature written around the Bahá’í Cause.

Through his great love for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Mírzá Ahmad
> Sohrab has given us a glimpse into that divine life of servitude
> and sacrifice, whose imperishable traces are written in the history
> of this age.

The diary notes of the author were arranged chronologically and a
Preface was provided in the same volume (1929 printing) which stated:

‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‘Abbás, a Persian, to whom millions turned as
> the prophet of International Peace and Brotherhood and who was
> hailed both in the East and in the West as the teacher of Love
> and Goodwill among mankind, was one of the outstanding spiritual
> figures of the 19th and 20th centuries.

His were inspired words, and men of all ranks obeyed him
and carried his precepts in their lives, because they realized that
here lived among them a godman—as 2000 years ago there lived
another godman in the midst of another people and another race.
To the students of the origin and growth of religions, the lives of
the founders of those religions have been the sources of the
most fruitful and searching studies, and here in the 20th century,
we saw with our own eyes a man who embodied in his life and
practiced in his daily association with his fellowmen, the highest
ideals of truth and beauty; laying the foundation of a Universal
Faith to which an ever increasing number of people from every
religion, and no religion have subscribed with unflinching loyalty.

Mírzá Ahmad Sohrab, also a Persian, lived and traveled with
‘Abdu’l-Bahá throughout America, Europe, Egypt and Palestine. As
his secretary and interpreter, from 1912 to 1919 he was with
him during eventful years which included the World War. Thus he
became a close observer of the events that transpired around
this great teacher of Universal Ideals and recorded daily his most
salient remarks, talks and utterances. Besides this, he translated
into English thousands of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s “Tablets” or letters to his
followers, scattered in all parts of the Western hemisphere.

Thus the Diary, kept by Mírzá Ahmad Sohrab, during those
eight years, is no other than a compendium of Bahá’í Ideals,
principles, events and stories, interspersed with general
reflections and descriptions of the countries through which they
traveled. It is a treasury of hopeful things for the sore-footed
traveler along the path of spiritual search.

When the Diary was being written, the Manuscript was
regularly mailed to Mr. and Mrs. Joseph H. Hannen of Washington,
D.C., who faithfully made typewritten copies and forwarded them
to all the Bahá’í Centers throughout the world.

In this manner, for years, extracts and quotations have
been circulated and published in all the Bahá’í literature and books
from what has become popularly known as “Ahmad’s Diary of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá.”

At different times in the past years, efforts have been
made to publish the Diary in its entirety—so that it may become
available not only to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s followers and admirers, but to
students of religions and philosophy as well; but the psychological
hour had not yet arrived. Praise be to God, these obstacles are at
last removed and God in His mysterious way has provided the

means through the instrumentality of “The New History
> Foundation”—so that the Diary may be given to the world in a
series of uniform volumes.

The present book covers a period of three months—from
> July 1st to September 30th, 1913. It is hoped that the second
> volume will be ready for publication at an early date and so, with
> the help of God, from time to time various volumes will be given
out until the whole series is complete.

In the course of writing the Diary, the author often refers
> to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‘Abbás as the “Master” or the “Beloved.” This
> title was one of the many given to him by his Father, Bahá’u’lláh,
> the founder of the Bahá’í Movement. “Aga” is the Persian word
> for the “Master” or “Lord” and by this title, he was known to all
> the Bahá’ís, up to the year 1892, when Bahá’u’lláh departed from
> this life and then, he took to himself the name of “‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá”—the Servant of God. But to the people outside the Bahá’í
community, he was ever known as “‘Abbás Effendi.”

The author in presenting this Diary to the world in its
> original form written some twenty years ago hopes that the
> reader will be able to conjure a picture of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s life and
> ministrations among the early adherents of the Bahá’í Movement.

In preparing Abdul Baha in Egypt for inclusion in this volume, great
care was exercised in ensuring authenticity. However, it was felt that a light
editing would make the text more accessible:

> 1. Several misspellings or punctuation errors corrected.
2. Transliteration of Persian names were brought in line with current

method used in Bahá’í publications.

Bahai News , vol. 1, Chicago (October 16, 1910) Ilm, No. 12

First of a series of special news items pertaining to the tour of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá.

Portion of a letter from Mr. Sydney Sprague to Mrs. Isabella D.

Brittingham.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Egypt.

\[11\] The author of this letter, Sydney Sprague, was married to the daughter of Mírzá
Asadu’lláh and had been one of the early pioneer teachers. His book, A Year With the
Bahais in India and Burma, was published in London in 1908. Sprague rendered valuable
help in the running of the Baháaí Tarbiyat School in Tehran.

significance; for it is, undoubtedly, that event whereby the
Word of God, as uttered by the Prophet Hosea (11:1), finds its
complete fulfillment—although foreshadowed in the sojourn of
the infant Jesus in that land nearly two thousand years ago
(St. Matt. 2:15).

It is an event that has stirred the Bahá’ís everywhere, for
when it became known that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had departed for that
ancient country of Joseph, there swept over the Bahá’í world a
mighty spirit of activity. It is an event that will, doubtless, soon
command the serious attention of the Jewish and Christian world
(especially those who await the coming of the Son “in the glory
of his Father”), as it has already commanded the attention of
the Mohammedan world; for, at present, the Egyptian
newspapers—the most influential in the Mohammedan world
today—are divided into two camps: some praising ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
work; others trying to stop the floodgate of his irresistible
influence.

Moamid, a paper respected by all the Islamic world, says:
“Although he (‘Abdu’l-Bahá) has lived the greater part of his life
in ‘Akká, Syria, yet there are millions of people—in Persia, India,
Europe and America—who follow him and respect him to the
point of worship and adoration. Whosoever associates with him,
finds him a man who has information upon all subjects of human
interest; his words are eloquent and attract the hearts, and
enkindle the souls. His teachings and conversation revolve
around the center of the greatest of the world’s problems: To
remove entirely, religious, racial and patriotic prejudices and lays
the foundation of a brotherhood and unity that will last
throughout the ages and eternity.”

Such is the statement of the leading newspaper printed in
Arabic, while the editor of an influential Persian newspaper
printed in Cairo writes in a personal letter that he was summoned
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to his presence, and although a few weeks
before, he wrote and published an article against the Cause of
Bahá’u’lláh, he accepted the invitation and left Cairo for
Alexandria. He met ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and became a changed man. He
went a stranger and an avowed antagonist; he returned a friend,
and will write an article in favor of the Cause. He writes: “Indeed,
I was very much benefited in meeting ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The Arabic
newspapers are now anxiously waiting to read my comment upon
the matter. You shall read my paper No. 20 and believe you will

prize it very highly. There is no doubt that some people will
> slander and accuse me of being bought, but I do not care. I have
> seen the Truth, and I will write the truth, no matter what may
happen.”

Many others, who have been the enemies of the Cause,
> have gone, either through curiosity or honest investigation, to
> visit ‘Abdu’l-Bahá—the Servant of God and man—and have
returned with the Glory of Truth in their faces.

What is the key to this irresistible spiritual power that
> thus opens the locked doors of the hearts of men? Those who
> are familiar with his Teachings, answer that it is his practice of
> them. He says: “Be ye kind to the human world as be ye
> compassionate to the race of man. Deal with the stranger as you
> deal with the friends. Be ye gentle toward the outsiders as you
> are toward the beloved ones. Know ye the enemy as the friend.
> Look upon the satan as upon the angel and receive the unjust
with the utmost love like unto a faithful one.”

Truly, as of old, great miracles are transpiring on the
banks of the river Nile, and the ancient land of the Pharaohs!

Third of a series of special news items pertinent to the sojourn of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá in Egypt.

Special to the Bahai News:

You have asked for an account of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s departure to
> the land of Egypt. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá did not inform anyone that he
> was going to leave Haifa. The day he left he visited the Holy
> Tomb of the Báb on Mt. Carmel, and when he came down from
> the mountain of the Lord, he went direct to the steamer. This
> was the first anyone knew about the matter. Within two days he
> summoned to his presence, Mírzá Núri’d-Dín12, Shoghi Effendi,
> Khusraw13, and this servant. The only persons who accompanied
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Egypt were Mírzá Munír Zayn and ‘Abdu’l-Husayn,
> one of the pilgrims who was leaving at that time. When Mírzá
> Núri’d-Dín arrived in Port Said, his brother Mírzá Munír returned
to Haifa.

For nearly one month ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remained in Port Said
> and the friends of God came from Cairo, in turn, to visit him. One
> day he called me to accompany him when taking a walk in the
> streets of the city. He said: “Do you realize now the meaning of
> my statement when I was telling the friends that there was a
> wisdom in my indisposition?” I answered, “Yes, I do remember
> very well.” He continued, “Well, the wisdom was that I must
> always move according to the requirements of the Cause.
> Whatever the Cause requires for its promulgation, I will not delay
> in its accomplishment for one moment! Now, the Cause did
> require that I travel to these parts, and had I divulged my
intention at that time, many difficulties would have arisen.”

The day that he left for Alexandria he did not mention the
> matter to anyone; nor did this servant know the time of his
> departure. However, when I heard that he had left, I hurried to
> the steamer and there met him with two pilgrims from ‘Ishqabad.
> He said: “Tell the friends, how, under severe circumstances of
> bodily weakness, I have accepted the hardships of traveling to
> promote the Word of God, to spread the Cause of God and to
> diffuse the Fragrances of God! I have left behind friends,
> relatives, and home for the sake of the Cause!” By this he meant
> that the believers of God must follow in his footsteps and
> illumine the East and the West with the lights of knowledge,
> peace, and brotherhood.

\[12\] Mírzá Núrí’d-Dín Zayn was a son of Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin, who had been an apostle of
Bahá’u’lláh and had transcribed many of His Tablets. Mírzá Núrí’d-Dín served as a secretary
to both ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and later to Shoghi Effendi.

\[13\] Khusraw was an attendant of ‘Abdu'l-Bahá of Burmese origin.

While in Alexandria many mooted persons, formerly

> the Movement. In regard to the Moaid article, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says:
> “A clipping from the newspaper of Moaid, which is the first

Fourth of a series of special news items pertaining to the sojourn of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Egypt.

> A Call to the American Bahá’ís
> From Muhammad Yazdí

\[14\] He was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s attendant during His journey to the West.

Praise be to God! that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has left the gloomy city of
imprisonment for the freedom of the world. His only aim is to
teach and raise the Standard of the Cause. When he was under
the surveillance of the authorities in ‘Akká and confined to a
limited prison life, he created the spirit of happiness and joy in
every heart, and never complained, neither did he show distress
or sadness on account of that imprisonment. When freedom was
proclaimed in Turkey, a constitution declared, the prisoners set
free, and a new era of brotherhood and good fellowship ushered
in among the various sects, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, while happy for the
freedom of the people, longed for his own imprisonment. His
opinion was that under all circumstances he ought to serve the
world of humanity, and while living in ‘Akká he served it
effectively, even though a prisoner; but being freed, nothing was
left for him to do in ‘Akká, and, like a bird released from its cage,
he soared to other climes and countries.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá in all the divine characteristics is intensely
human and keenly alive to the joys and sorrows of existence.
There is no one who feels more acutely the sufferings of
humanity than he and no one loves his fellow-men more than he.
Here, in Alexandria, he lives exactly like other men; he goes into
the stores, into the mosques, into the prisons. He converses just
as kindly and amiably with the humblest man in the street as
with the highest in the land. His matchless and magnetic
kindness attracts all, whether ignorant or wise, rich or poor; he is
no respecter of persons and in some instances, after a half-
hour’s conversation, his bitterest enemy has become his
staunchest friend.

His coming to Egypt has added great enthusiasm and zeal
to the hearts of the friends. He has uplifted them from a state of
comparative oblivion to a world-wide celebrity. He is no more a
possible myth or a fable; he is there, standing “powerful, mighty,
and supreme!” The sun of his presence radiates the light of love
and compassion; people see him, feel the wonderful influence of
his presence, talk with him, walk with him as did the men of old
walking with Jesus of Nazareth along the shores of Galilee. They
can no longer doubt him and his Teachings.

When he first arrived in Egypt, a great cry and clamor was
raised by the representatives of the people (the newspapers). All
were expressing opinions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. No one could form a
just and impartial view of him. Facts were exaggerated and

misrepresentations abounded in every paper. One writer
expressed the opinion that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá hates all religions, that
his followers throughout the world are very few, and that his
teachings are destructive to the well-being and prosperity of
human society.

Such were the conditions when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá with his
might and his glory, his meekness and humility, entered the land
of Pharaoh. But lo! after a short time the clouds of
misrepresentation were dispelled and the light of reality shone
forth with great splendor. So much so, that at present there is
not one dissenting voice in the land of Egypt about the
greatness of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Muqaddam, one of the most
influential Arabic newspapers, in a long article of November 28,
1910, comes out valiantly and defends in most eloquent terms
the Teachings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Not being satisfied with this, the
editor quotes from the Book of Aqdas wherein Bahá’u’lláh
commands all despotic rulers to lay aside their absolutism and
accept the constitution and establish in their kingdoms the
Houses of Justice. He even upbraids in the strongest terms the
other newspaper writers, calling attention to the responsibilities
and duties of their positions—that is, to mirror forth facts and
realities and not falsehoods and accusations. He says that every
writer has been reveling in a riotous feast of exaggeration and
derision; that they have gone beyond the limit of politeness and
courtesy, which attributes differentiate man from beast. Now, if
we compare such articles with what first appeared concerning
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, we will find them as different as day from night.

Some people have expressed anxieties and fears because
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s possible visit to America; they think that the
newspapers will write sensational articles and ridicule the Cause.
Such people are very short-sighted. They have not realized
deeply, or superficially, the force of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence.
Neither have they dreamed of the magnetic influence of his
Highness (rather his Kindness, ah, me!). He is a man whose very
appearance will solve all the perplexed anxieties of the visionaries
of disaster. We as Bahá’ís have nothing to be afraid of. We are
the spiritual physicians of the world; we are the torch-bearers of
the ideal civilization; we are the teachers of the Kingdom of
Abhá. Should we be afraid to receive the One who is the source
of all our inspiration and all our light; America must raise a
gladsome voice of spiritual beatitude, spread a heavenly

banquet, and be prepared, for “he shall come as a thief in the
night.” Future historians will record the coming of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
to America as a great and momentous event. Broaden your
vision and look into the future, when the nations of America shall
celebrate, from one end of the continent to the other, the
anniversary of the day when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá set foot upon “the
land of the brave and the free!” Future generations will sing in
anthems and songs the resplendent glory of such a day. Children
will be taught to respect and love that day. America is on the
threshold of a great spiritual awakening, and it must arise to
fulfill the responsibilities of such a wonderful and glowing
promise. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has written to you in several Tablets that
he will come as soon as the friends in that country are united as
bands of steel or a golden chain of life. Now it depends upon
you. You must show to the world that you are united, that you
are worthy to receive him in your midst. Let not this opportunity
slip from your grasp. Arise, work, band together, and remove the
difficulties from his path. This day is not for fretting and
discontentment, nor imagining the possibility of ridicule by the
masses. Have you not faith in him? Has he not grappled with and
solved the greatest problems for the past sixty years! Has he
not conversed with the wisest men of the age? Again we say,
prepare the way for his coming! Let not your minds be troubled
with outside questions. He is able to change the ridicule into
praise, the enmity into friendship and the derision into exaltation.
When he arrived in Alexandria we were not prepared to receive
him. There is no need of preparing houses and establishments for
his reception; the probability is that he will take a place for
himself when he arrives. The first thing that he did when he
arrived in Alexandria was to take a house, and all the friends
from far and near flocked around him He does not want your
houses and palaces, but your hears. Prepare your hearts, purify
your hears, cleanse your hearts, the he may find a place therein!

The life of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is simple; is attitude is humble;
his needs are very few. You think that if he should come to
America you must have a house prepared and surround him
with luxuries of modern civilization. Far from it! With love,
unity, and harmony, shining like stars of heaven in your dist, a
little cottage is greater than the imperial palace of kings. All
through his life his sole purpose and aim has been to spread
the fragrances of God, to serve the Kingdom of Abhá, and to
sacrifice himself for the good of the world. He has done all

these; nay, rather, his services to man cannot be measured by
> any criterion. His life, like unto a tempestuous sea, is ever in
> motion, casting pearls of significance and truth upon its shore.
> Humanity owes to him a debt that can never be paid with
> money or gratitude. Notwithstanding all he has done for the
> world, hearken to what he says in a recent Tablet:

> The invisible hand has opened the doors, and wisdom
> requires that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá hasten to the country of
> Egypt; for he is infinitely ashamed and chagrined that
> he has not yet been assisted in servitude. Perchance,
> through traveling in this land, he may be assisted in the
> future to some small service. Now we are living in the
> country of Canaan and are supplicating day and night at
> the Threshold of Mercifulness and beg confirmation and

> the quality of the believers than the quantity? This is the policy
> of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, as the following incident will show:

Two nights ago, an American journalist, Mr. William Ellis,
representing The Continent, came especially to Alexandria to
interview ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. It was my privilege to be the translator
on this occasion. One of the first questions Mr. Ellis asked was:
“How many followers have you?” The answer was: “We have no
statistics and we do not consider these things important. It is
the quality of the believers we care for. If a few were
characterized with the attributes of God and live according to
the divine Teachings, it is praiseworthy. Five diamonds are worth
more than five million stones.” Again the journalist asked: “Have
you not many followers in America?” “I have a few friends in
different cities who love me,” was the reply. “Is it not true that
half of Persia is Bahá’í?” persisted the journalist. “No; it is not,”
replied ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “but many there who are not Bahá’ís, are
influenced by our Teachings.” “Are there not many followers in
the Turkish Empire?” “No,” and again ‘Abdu’l-Bahá reiterated the
non-importance of numbers. The journalist seemed very much
taken aback. He evidently expected ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to boast of a
large following. What an example ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has set us!

Then Mr. Ellis asked briefly: “What are the Teachings of
the Bahá’í Revelation and in what does it differ from other
religions?” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá replied: “While all the other religions are
hating and denouncing each other, the Bahá’ís are the friends of
all religions and the lovers of all peoples, and their aim is to unite
and harmonize all.” There were many other questions which drew
forth wonderful, illuminating explanations from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. I
have not the time to write them now, but be on the lookout for
an account of this interview in The Continent. Mr. Ellis is on his
way to Persia to write articles about that country, so he may
write of the Cause there.

There are two interesting English persons here, a Mr. and
Mrs. Atwood, at one time prominent spiritualists in London. As
Mr. Atwood is slightly paralyzed, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá went to see them,
much to their great joy. They are now eager to serve the Cause.

There are pilgrims here from Persia, Russia, India and
England, and every night we meet in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s house and
our cups are filled to overflowing. His health is good. When Mr.
Ellis asked him if he was benefited by the change of air, he
replied: “Certainly, one who has been a prisoner for forty years
must be benefited to breathe another air.” I thought to myself,
can we Bahá’ís realize what those forty years mean? The

Christians think so much of the forty days Jesus fasted in the
> wilderness and observe a penitential season to commemorate
> this; but forty years for every day a year!

A visit to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Alexandria.

> representative of The Christian Commonwealth recently called

upon Mr. Wellesley Tudor Pole, who has just returned from the
East, where he has been studying the movement at first hand.

“How did you come to be interested in the Bahá’í
movement?” he said.

“I first heard of the movement when on a visit to
Constantinople prior to the Turkish revolution in 1908, and I was
very much impressed by the fact that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá could exert
such an influence from within prison walls. When I returned to
London I found that very little was known of the movement, and
I determined to visit ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, known to the outside world by
the name of ‘Abbás Effendi, on the first available opportunity
and discover for myself the secret of his power.”

“And it is most extraordinary,” Mr. Pole continued, “that
so little should be known of this movement in England. There are
said to be between two and three million Bahá’ís at least in
Persia alone, and many more in India, the Middle East, America,
France, Russia, and elsewhere. There is no religious freedom in
Persia; if there were it would be found that very great numbers
of men would declare themselves disciples. No less than thirty
thousand men and women in Persia alone are reported to have
sacrificed everything for the movement. I met an old Persian
Bahá’í in Alexandria his name was Shaykh Muhammad who joined
the movement when he was a young man, and he was publicly
flogged and all his property was taken from him. He and his
whole household were sent out into the mountains in the heart
of winter without food or money. Many times he has been
imprisoned, and it has been a miracle how he has escaped with
his life. In many towns and villages he has been stoned and
brutally treated. Hundreds of men and women have proved
themselves ready to endure such treatment, to leave home and
country, for the sake of their great ideal.”
“What is the ideal which has inspired such heroism?”

“The fundamental principle of what has come to be called
the Bahá’í Revelation is a belief in the underlying unity of
religions and peoples. It stands for the harmony of all spiritual
truths and all faiths, for international peace and goodwill. It
asserts the equality of the sexes, the duty of everyone to serve
the community, and the duty of the community to give
opportunity for such service. It desires a social order where the
brotherhood of man shall be expressed in all the relationships of
life, and where the community shall be responsible for the sick,

the aged, the infirm, and all who cannot obtain their own
livelihood.”

> “What gave birth to this movement?”
> “It arose in 1844, when a young Persian, Mírzá ‘Alí-
Muhammad, went about Eastern Europe prophesying that a great
teacher would follow him. He called himself the Báb (the Gate)
and stood as the John the Baptist of the new movement. He
affirmed that the coming teacher would not only fulfill the
prophecies of the Qur’an, but also of the sacred scriptures of the
Hindu and Hebrew peoples. Mírzá ‘Alí-Muhammad was bitterly
persecuted, and finally shot in 1850. By this time the movement
had spread all over Persia, and in the early fifties Bahá’u’lláh, the
son of a noble Persian family, came forward and proclaimed
himself the teacher who had been promised.”

“Bahá’u’lláh, by the way, had never met the Báb. In 1863,
by an arrangement between the Persian and Turkish
Governments, spurred on by the mullás, who were alarmed by
the spread of the new teaching, Bahá’u’lláh and his family were
first sent to Constantinople, then banished to Adrianople, and
finally, in 1868, exiled to ‘Akká, a fortified Turkish town on the
Syrian coast, where Bahá’u’lláh was kept in more or less close
confinement until his death, at the age of seventy five, in 1892.
At times he was treated in the most brutal way chained to other
men by the neck and subjected to torture. In spite of the
imprisonment of the leader, the movement spread with
tremendous rapidity throughout the Middle East. Pilgrims came
from India and other distant parts to receive the blessing of
Bahá’u’lláh at the prison bars.”
“What happened when he died?”

“He left a book of laws and many other works, and
instructed his followers to look to his eldest son, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
to carry on his work and to expound his writings. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
which means the ‘Servant of God,’ was kept in prison at ‘Akká
until the time of the Turkish Revolution in 1908, when, along
with all political prisoners, he was released. He went to live near
Haifa, close to Mt. Carmel, but about two months ago he started
on a journey, and is now in Egypt. That is a bare outline of the
progress of the movement, but it gives no idea of the
extraordinary power that lies behind it.”

“Did you meet ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on your recent visit to the
East?”

“Yes, I met ‘Abdu’l-Bahá near Alexandria, where he was
> staying with some of his followers. Let me try to give you a word
> picture of him. He is sixty five years of age, of medium height
> and of commanding presence; he has long silver gray beard and
> hair, blue grey eyes, a fine forehead, a wonderful carriage, and a
> sweet but powerful voice. He was dressed when I saw him, in
> cream white robes and a white Persian headdress. You feel at
> once that here is a master of men and a marvelous spiritual
> personality. He seemed to me to focus in a truly divine manner
> the spiritual ideal of the coming age. When one has come in
> contact with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s power, or rather the power behind
> him, one has no doubt that this movement will vitally affect the
> religious and social evolution of the whole world. At his table I
> met pilgrims who had come to receive his blessing from many
> parts of the world, and representing almost every faith the world
> knows. Jews, Mohammedans Hindus, Zoroastrians and Christians
> sat around one table, all holding this one great belief that God
> has again sent one of his messengers to earth, and that the
> great call that was focused in Bahá’u’lláh is the call for the unity
> of nations, the brotherhood of man, the peace of the whole
> world, and the realization of those fundamental truths that lie
> behind all faiths. Bahá’u’lláh did not say to the Christian, ‘Come
> out of your religious order,’ nor did he say to the Mohammedan
> ‘Turn your back on your faith.’ He said to every man, ‘Go and live
> out your faith in unity and brotherhood with all mankind, and
> thus show that behind all expressions of religion there is one
> religion and one God.’”

Statements Regarding His Morals and Religion.

However, it is probable that he will not respond to their
invitation, on account of the remoteness of the country and the
length of the trip.

We have received a letter from the celebrated scholar,
Shawkry Effendi, who has just arrived from Syria, in which he
praises ‘Abbás Effendi, explains his religion and produces certain
arguments in his favor.

He says: “The wisdom of ‘Abbás Effendi, our respected
guest, descends from a family which was noble in lineage and
descent in the Kingdom of Persia. He is the son of the ‘Dweller of
Paradise, Bahá’u’lláh, the founder of the Bahá’í Movement, and
he is the successor of his Father. In regard to his morality and
character, he is the pattern of dignity and perfection. He is
gracious, generous, noble minded, philanthropic, charitable and
full of benevolence. He is very kind to the poor and patient to
the indigent. He does not make any difference between the
followers of any religion, whether they be Christians, Jews,
Mohammedans or Brahmans. To him all are the same; he looks
upon them as part of the same family of humanity and not their
particular religion. The aim of his movement is the unity of
religions in the world and their equality among the children of
men. He thinks that the differences of religions are impeding the
progress of the world and he believes that the removal of these
differences will benefit mankind.”

“This religion has spread greatly and is carried to Europe
and America so much so that today the number of Bahá’ís has
reached the number of fifteen million, men, women and children
included. Many of these Bahá’ís are in New York, Chicago and
India, Persia, Egypt and Syria, and it is continually growing and
spreading.”

“The Tomb of Bahá’u’lláh is in ‘Akká, called Bahjí and every
year the Bahá’ís come from all parts of the world to visit it.”

“Twice I have called upon ‘Abbás Effendi while in Ramleh
and have seen the poor and indigent gathered around his house
waiting for him to come out and when he appears, they beg alms
and he gives to them. This is just a short sketch of his generous
qualities and I confess my inability to do it justice. His physical
appearance is medium size, white hair, penetrating eyes, smiling
face and wonderful countenance, courteous, and his manner,
simplicity itself, disliking any ostentation and show. He is a wise

man, a philosopher and his knowledge of the Turkish, Persian and
Arabic is unsurpassed.”

“He knows the history of nations and understands the
causes of their rise and fall.”

“He is sixty years old and on account of certain nervous
> ailments he has come to Egypt for change of air. He personally
> reads all the articles and letters sent him from all parts of the
> world, and answers the most important of them in his Persian
> handwriting which is famous for its beauty. Many of the great
> men of this country and delegates from other nations have met
> him and he gives a personal interview to each one of them. No
> one has visited him without leaving him impressed by his
> presence and praising his qualities and wondering at his
magnanimity and his astonishing mind.”

“Concerning the reports of his leaving ‘Akká and the
> statement that he is against the Constitution, this was without
> foundation and the proof of this is his endeavor to unite the
> religions in the world and establish equality among nations. If
> such were his qualities, working against religions and
> constitution, and on the other hand trying to bring union and
> harmony amongst them, how can we reconcile the two? This is
> indeed far from him, for he is a man who advocated the
> Constitution from the very beginning and before the Turkish
> people received their Constitution. But the real object of his
> coming to Egypt is for the change of air and his physical
> condition. This is the real truth we are proclaiming at the top of
> our voice and if there is any virtue in it, it requires no praise or
blame.”

This is what our correspondent writes and we thought it
advisable to quote it as we received it.

> Impressions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá while in Ramleh.

By Mr. Louis G. Gregory.

I am asked by the Star of the West for impressions
> gathered during a recent pilgrimage to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at Ramleh
> and the Holy City. Now I can respond but briefly; but later I hope
> that a full account may be given to the friends of the Cause of
all the valuable lessons received from the Perfect Man.

It is the will of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that all the friends should be
> united and happy in the light of the Kingdom. On one occasion
> Bahá’u’lláh said, “Heaven is happiness and peace. Hell is the
> hearts of those who deny and oppose.” Today the happiness and
> peace of the Glory of God (Bahá’u’lláh) are reflected in the clear
> Mirror of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Thus by meeting him one meets all the
> Prophets and Manifestations of cycles and ages past. It is
> difficult for one to realize at the time, or for a long time
> afterwards, the true honor of such a meeting. To one who
> realizes even faintly who this Servant of God is and what powers
> he represents, such a meeting is high above all honors of earth.
> But no soul can give adequate testimony of what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
> may be to any other soul. With mental and spiritual horizon more
> or less limited, each pilgrim discerns according to his capacity
> the Majesty and Power that radiate from the Center of God’s
> Covenant.

At Ramleh, ‘Abbás Effendi* might at times be seen walking
> about the streets. Oft times he would ride upon the electric
> tramway, making change and paying his fare in the most
> democratic fashion. His reception room was open to believers
> and non believers alike. Upon a visit to some unfortunates one
> day I asked if they knew him. “O yes,” they responded, “he has
> been in this house.” Thus in one way or another, thousands of
> Persians had opportunity to see ‘Abbás Effendi; but among these
how few perceived ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

Viewed with the outer eye, he is about the medium height,
> with symmetrical features. His lineaments indicate meekness and
> gentleness, as well as power and strength. His color is about that
> of parchment. His hands are shapely, with the nails well
> manicured. His forehead is high and well rounded. His nose is
> slightly aquiline; his eyes light blue and penetrating; his hair is
> silvery, and long enough to touch the shoulders; his beard is
> white. His dress was the Oriental robes, graceful in their
> simplicity. On his head rested a light tar bush, surrounded by a
> white, turban. His voice is powerful, but capable of producing
> infinite pathos and tenderness. His carriage is erect and
> altogether so majestic and beautiful that it is passing strange
> that anyone seeing him would not be moved to say: “This truly is
the King of men!”

On the rational plane his wisdom is incomparable. During
> the time of my visit, persons were present from different parts
> of the world. But people of acquired learning are bat as children
> to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. They were reverent in their attitude toward him
> and one of them, an Oxford man, praised his wisdom with much
> enthusiasm. They sought his advice and found it of the highest
value in application to life.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá has the power to make his friends very
> happy. What music and harmony, joy and peace, may enter into
> the lives of those who attain this meeting! He has a balm for
> every wound and feeds hungry souls with the Manna of his
> Perfect Love. One of the friends at Cairo, a noted worker in the
> Cause, exclaimed, “If I could only see ‘Abdu’l-Bahá once a week!”
> At ‘Akká and Haifa were to be found those who had spent most
> of their lives with him. But they were all longing for his Presence.

Among the letters received by him at Ramleh was one from the

daughter of a king, expressing as her utmost desire a visit at the
threshold of his door. This is the Power of the Spirit.

Thus the friends of the Cause may catch a glimpse of what
