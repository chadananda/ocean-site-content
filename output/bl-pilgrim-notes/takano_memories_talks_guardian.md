      MEMORIES OF TALKS WITH THE GUARDIAN

by
a Japanese pilgrim, Mr. Hiroyasu Takano

(as related at
the 1980 Bahá’í National Convention of Japan)

Haifa, February 1954. Hiroyasu Takano, on the right, with fellow
pilgrims Loyce Lawrence and Maud and Albert Reimholz. From Haifa Mr.
Takano returned to Japan, having spent a year in the United States,
where he had been sent by his company. Loyce Lawrence, originally from
the U.S.A., was a Knight of Bahá’u’lláh serving in the Lofoten Islands of
Norway, beyond the Arctic Circle; the Reimholzes were living in the U.S.A.
and later were pioneers in South Africa. The photograph was taken by
another pilgrim, Irene Bennett, originally from the U.K. and a pioneer in
Kenya and Uganda. Thus do pilgrims gather in the Holy Land from, and
disperse to, all corners of the globe.

The above photograph is reproduced from the webpage

-1954/. The webpage contains Irene Bennett’s account of her pilgrimage,
including several mentions of Mr. Takano—it seems the other pilgrims
called him “Hero”.

Foreword

Mr. Takano and his talk
Hiroyasu Takano was the only Japanese Bahá’í, other than Saichiro
Fujita, to meet Shoghi Effendi. An electrical engineer, he became a Bahá’í
in the United States of America, where he had been sent by his company
for training and experience. Attendance at the May 1953 dedication of the
House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois was apparently an impetus for his
acceptance of the Faith. Mr. Takano applied for pilgrimage and, after a
brief stint in West Germany, visited Haifa in late February and early March
1954 on his way back to Japan. He later served on the Tokyo Spiritual
Assembly and was for many years the chairman of the National Spiritual
Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Japan. Among other achievements, he was
largely responsible for the computerization of operations at the Bahá’í
National Center. He passed away in 2011; in a posthumous message
from the World Center, assurance is conveyed of the supplications of the
Universal House of Justice “at the Sacred Threshold for the progress of
[Mr. Takano’s] noble soul throughout the worlds of God.” (This too-brief
biography is mostly based on information contained in the book Unfurling
the Divine Flag in Tokyo: An Early Bahá’í History pp. 72-73.)

Although the subtitle of this document suggests the following text is
a translation of a talk recalling his pilgrimage that Mr. Takano gave at the
1980 Bahá’í National Convention of Japan, there is reason to believe it is
actually a translation of a cassette tape recording Mr. Takano made not
long after the Convention, under the auspices of the Audio-Visual
Committee, reprising a talk given at the Convention; this matter is
addressed just below, under “The translation”. What follows, therefore, is
not Mr. Takano’s pilgrim’s notes, per se, but rather a talk based on those
notes. Perhaps in reviewing his notes to prepare for the talk Mr. Takano
decided to redact some of their content, in that he does not mention
remarks made to him by Shoghi Effendi as recounted by Amatu’l-Bahá
Rúḥíyyih K͟ hánum in her book The Priceless Pearl p. 360:

> I remember watching the face of the first Japanese Bahá’í pilgrim
> when Shoghi Effendi, with those wonderfully expressive eyes of his
> fixed upon him, said that as the majority of the human race was not
white there was no reason why the majority of Bahá’ís should be

white. The emphasis and openness with which Shoghi Effendi
> stated this was clearly a revelation to this man from the Far East
> who was returning from a protracted stay in the United States.

A number of items among Mr. Takano’s belongings have recently
come into the possession of the National Archives Committee, following
the passing of his wife, but, as of the writing of this foreword, these items
have not been processed as a collection by the Committee. The original
Haifa notes may be among these items.

Early in his talk Mr. Takano indicates that this is the second occasion
his recollections of the Guardian’s remarks have been recorded on tape
by the Audio-Visual Committee. Through the kindness and efficiency of
Ms. Tomo Fushimi, a member of the National Archives Cmte., the
undersigned editor was able to listen to both recordings: one produced in
1980 and one in 1977 (the year being printed on each cassette). There is
some material in the ’77 recording not heard in the ’80, and this is
elaborated in Appendix 1.

The title given this document, presumably by the translator, is
“Memories of Talks with the Guardian”, but Mr. Takano himself in his
recording does not give the talk any title nor does a narrator who speaks
a few introductory lines at the beginning; the title as handwritten in
Japanese on the Audio-Visual Cmte. cassette is 守護者会見記ᴆ高野博康氏
巡礼ノートより (shugosha kaikenki takano hiroyasu shi junrei no̅to yori),
which can be rendered as “Record of Interviews with the Guardian, from
the Pilgrimage Notes of Mr. Hiroyasu Takano”.

The translation
The following text, including its title and subtitle, has been retyped
by the undersigned editor from a typescript containing the English
translation of Mr. Takano’s original talk in Japanese. Concerning how the
typescript became available to this editor, see the afterword.

While the subtitle of the translation typescript states that it is of a talk
Mr. Takano gave at the 1980 Bahá’í National Convention of Japan, as
mentioned above there are several points which together constitute
reason to believe it is actually of a tape-recording made after that
Convention: first, the translation both fully renders the content of the tape-
recording and precisely follows the order or sequence of that content;
also, early in the tape-recording and in the translation (see page 8 herein)

Mr. Takano says “this tape is the third time I am relating my experiences
as a pilgrim”—which confirms that the translation is of a tape-recording—
but the tape contains no applause or background sound one would
expect at a Convention session; and finally, toward the end of the tape
and the translation (see page 24 herein) Mr. Takano states that the
particular matter he is discussing was not covered in his remarks at the
Convention, which confirms that both the tape-recorded talk and the
translation postdate the Convention. (Incidentally, if Mr. Takano spoke at
the Convention about his pilgrimage, his experiences would have been
related four times total, not three as he is quoted above saying.)

On the other hand, in places the translation contains text not spoken
by Mr. Takano in the recording. Furthermore, that text has not been
enclosed in brackets or otherwise distinguished by the translator in the
typescript. Why this extra text exists is unclear: as far as this editor knows,
he listened to a tape copied from the master tape, not an edited version
missing parts of Mr. Takano’s talk, and thus presumably the editor
listened to the same recording the translator worked from; it is also
certain that the translation is not of the 1977 recorded talk.

A possible explanation for the extra content is that Mr. Takano may
have spoken from the same script for the tape-recording as at the
Convention—the above-mentioned introductory narration (which itself is
not translated) states that the tape-recording reprises remarks Mr.
Takano made at the Convention—but the script may have been pared
somewhat for the recording, and the pared content then restored for the
translation, perhaps at Mr. Takano’s request and perhaps for an
expository purpose—the added passages often expound or summarize
the points Mr. Takano is making on the tape. It is also possible that the
passages in question are not from a talk given at the Convention but
rather exclusive to the translation and inserted by the translator, either on
his/her own (which seems unlikely) or at Mr. Takano’s direction. In any
case, these extra passages have been identified by footnote herein. If the
provenance of these added passages or if other information concerning
the talk or the translation comes to be known, this foreword will be
updated.

The translation itself, generally accurate and quite readable, uses
here and there some rather colloquial or idiomatic expressions that
convey the meaning but not the formal register of the original talk; further,
Mr. Takano employs an honorific level befitting the stature of the Guardian

when speaking about him, a style that cannot be duplicated in English.

The translator’s name is not given on the typescript; the presence of
colloquialisms makes it doubtful that Mr. Takano himself is the translator.

Editorial matters
It would easy to edit the translation here and there for style as well
as delete the added content, but the text has been retyped precisely as it
is for historiographical reasons (including that the translation text was
apparently sent to the World Center; see the afterword). Nevertheless,
one part of the text has been redacted by this editor for reason of
sensitivity of subject matter (the number of readers of this account on the
Bahá’í-Library website very likely being far larger than the number of
listeners of the original talk); the location of the deleted text is marked by
an ellipsis.

Editorial comments are placed in footnotes and editorial
interpolations embedded in the main text in brackets; the afterword and
appendices contain further editorial commentary. In the editorial matter,
passages from works revealed by the Central Figures are italicized;
passages from the messages and letters of Shoghi Effendi and the
Universal House of Justice are placed within double guillemets ‹‹ ›› rather
than quotation marks; and passages from letters written on behalf of
Shoghi Effendi and written by the secretariat of the House of Justice are
placed within quotation marks, unless the passages are given block form,
in which case the marks are left off. Book citations are from editions that
were readily available online. The translation text has a misspelling or is
lacking capitalization usual in Bahá’í usage in a few places, and these
have been editorially “sicced”. Macrons signify long vowel sounds in the
transliteration of Japanese text.

Other bios
Following are brief notes on the only persons, other than ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and Shoghi Effendi, to be referred to individually in Mr. Takano’s
talk. Very early in the talk—the first page of the translation, or page 8
herein—reference is made to Agnes Alexander and Ikuo Mizuno. Ms.
Alexander needs no note, but mention can be made of her distinction by
name in the Tablets of the Divine Plan, her appointment as Hand of the
Cause, and her being the first Bahá’í in the Hawaiian Islands, the second

to pioneer to Japan, and the first to teach the Faith in Korea. Shoghi
Effendi once wrote to her (Japan Will Turn Ablaze! p. 9) that she was a
‹‹radiant herald›› whose ‹‹glorious services in those remote regions of the
earth are never to be forgotten.››

Dr. Ikuo Mizuno was a surgeon by profession, served for many
years on the National Spiritual Assembly of Japan and as a member of
the Auxiliary Board, and translated the Kitáb-i-Íqán into Japanese. He
passed away in 1986 at the age of 91 years, and is fondly remembered
for talks in which, as would be expected of a physician, he compared the
structure and function of the Bahá’í Administrative Order to that of the
human body. (See Traces that Remain pp. 202-203.)

Caveat lector
The editor contacted the National Spiritual Assembly of Japan to
express his wish to post this document online, and the Assembly’s
secretariat stated no objection in reply but advised it be clearly stated
editorially that the recollections of pilgrims are not authoritative. And so
the abiding advisory is reiterated here: The content of notes taken by
pilgrims of the remarks of Shoghi Effendi—and perforce the content of
talks based on such notes—is inherently limited in authority and veracity.
Mr. Takano’s recorded talk, and thus the translation, almost entirely
summarizes Shoghi Effendi’s remarks rather than attempting to directly
quote them, and as such the reader should find it easier to resist the
temptation—which readily arises with pilgrims’ notes—to regard the
content as a verbatim record of those remarks.

by
a Japanese pilgrim, Mr. Hiroyasu Takano

(as related at
the 1980 Bahá’í National Convention of Japan)

It was 25 years ago, in the year Showa 29*, that
is, in 1954‡, that, at the invitation of Shoghi
Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith, I had the
honor of visiting Haifa as the first Japanese Bahá’í
pilgrim, and there sharing intimate discussions with
Shoghi Effendi.¶

After that, as soon as I got back to Japan, I
related the things I had heard from Shoghi Effendi
during my visit as a pilgrim, and at that time, some
of my notes were translated into English by Agnes
Alexander and passed out to some of the Bahá’ís of
Japan. Also, more than 20 years later, [Dr.] Ikuo
Mizuno came to me and suggested that I put these
pilgrim notes in order. I did do this, and the
resulting memoirs were distributed◊ by the Bahá’í
Audio-Visual Committee in the form of a cassette
tape bearing my name and entitled “Pilgrim’s Diary”.
Thus, this tape is the third time I am relating my
experiences as a pilgrim.

I’d like to tell you a little story as to why
* In Japan years can be reckoned by either the Gregorian calendar or the
imperial era. “Sho̅wa” is the regnal name of the person and the era of
Hirohito (r. 1926-1989).
‡ On the tape Mr. Takano does not say “that is, in 1954”.
¶ The original Japanese (親しくお話を伺う shitashiku ohanashi wo
ukagau) suggests listening to the remarks of the Guardian in a warm
atmosphere or intimate setting.
◊ In 1977.

I’m putting this tape together at this time. You
see, there was to be a teaching conference in the
Kansai Area* and there was a suggestion that, as one
of the conference topics, I relate my impressions of
the Guardian or some of the things he’d said to me.
Unfortunately, I couldn’t make it to that
conference, and had to turn down this request at
that time. But I took the opportunity to go over my
pilgrim notes once more.

Also, I met a number of Bahá’í pioneers and
foreigners who’d come to Japan, and each time I was
introduced as the only Japanese pilgrim to have ever
met the Guardian, I was asked, “What did the
Guardian say?” So I decided for myself that I would
like to put down on tape the things the Guardian
talked about during my pilgrimage, and the result is
this tape.

At any rate, since this was 26 years ago, when I
went over these notes, I realized that some of the
things were outdated and others were long passed. So
there is one thing I’d like you to bear in mind as
you listen to this talk. At the time I made my
pilgrimage, there were only 12 N[ational]
S[piritual] A[ssemblie]s in the entire world. Now, I
believe there are 150 or 160, but at that time,
there were a mere 12. Also, at that time, the only
areas in Japan that had been opened to the Faith
were Tokyo, Yokohama, Kyoto, Osaka, Amagasaki, Kobe,
Yanai, and the prefectures‡ of Nagasaki, Aichi, and
Akita — a mere 12¶ in all. It was at such a time,
then, that the Guardian talked with me about the
* The Kansai region includes the cities of Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe.
‡ A Japanese prefecture is analogous to a U.S. state. Yanai was the
home of Saichiro Fujita, who in 1955 left Japan to return to the Holy Land.
¶ On the tape Mr. Takano says “ten”.

things I’m going to relate to you on this tape. I’d
greatly appreciate it if you would keep this in mind
as you listen to my talk.

The first matters I should talk about, I
suppose, are those that concern Japan. The Guardian
said that, in the future Bahá’í world, the two areas
in the world that would be most in the limelight
were the continent of Africa and the area circling
the Pacific Ocean. He went on to stress that Japan
has an important role as one of the two centers in
the Pacific Region. These two centers are Australia
in the south and Japan in the north.

At this point, the Guardian said that there were
two meanings to the word “center” as he used it
here. One meaning is that of a center that could be
compared to the poles of a magnet, a center of
centripetal force that pulls in strength from its
surroundings; the other meaning is that of a
radiating center that gives off rays of light, that
is, a source of illumination.* He said that these
two centers, Australia and Japan, must be centers in
both of these ways. He stressed the fact that not
only will they develop this way, but also, that we
* One of the definitions of “centripetal” given in a dictionary online is
“moving or directed toward a center or axis.” In a letter dated July 19,
1957 found in Letters of the Guardian to Australia and New Zealand pp.
134-140, Shoghi Effendi writes of ‹‹a spiritual axis, extending from the
Antipodes to the northern islands of the Pacific Ocean—an axis whose
northern and southern poles will act as powerful magnets, endowed with
exceptional spiritual potency, and towards which other younger and less
experienced communities will tend for some time to gravitate.›› It would
be interesting to know if “centripetal” is the actual word Shoghi Effendi
used; on the tape Mr. Takano uses the Japanese equivalent of
“centripetal” (求心 kyu̅shin). Concerning the axis and the “radiating
center” see Appendix 2.
must work to make them this way.*

By the way, the Guardian stated that, as Japan
holds this important rank and shoulders such an
important role in the Bahá’í world, he was confident
that both Japan and the Japanese people have all the
qualities necessary to fully measure up to this
vital responsibility and to carry out this important
mission. He said that the Japanese are qualified not
only in terms of ability but also in terms of
experience and trials.‡

Let me give you the precise explanation of this
matter that the Guardian gave to me: He said that,
along with the Germans, the Japanese are the most
industrious nation in the world; also, they have
great capacity and are very spiritual. Japan has
continuously had a very high level of culture since
ancient times, and especially if one looks at the
amazing development Japan has achieved since
entering the modern age, one can say that the high
level of ability of the Japanese people has been
amply demonstrated. Moreover, if one also looks at
Japanese art, one realizes that the Japanese people
have an extremely great sense of balance. The
Guardian stressed that these points demonstrate the
ample ability of the Japanese people.

Secondly, the Guardian stated that the Japanese
* On the tape Mr. Takano does not speak this paragraph from “He said
that these two centers” beyond. (On unspoken text see the foreword.)
‡ On the tape Mr. Takano does not speak this last sentence. In a letter to
the Bahá’ís of Japan written soon after he became Guardian—see Japan
Will Turn Ablaze! p. 73—Shoghi Effendi quotes ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: ‹‹Japan is
endowed with a most remarkable capacity for the spread of the Cause of
God! Japan, with (another country whose name He stated but bade us
conceal it for the present) will take the lead in the spiritual reawakening of
the peoples and nations that the world shall soon witness!››

had ample experience to fulfill their
responsibility. As one example of this, he said that
the previous examples showed that the Japanese are
quite experienced in making organizations and
accomplishing things through these organizations.
Looking at Japanese society, one sees sufficient
proof of this.

He added that the Japanese also had ample
qualifications in terms of tests, since Japan is the
only country in the world to have experienced the
atomic bomb, and in this way, had experienced ample
sacrifice.

These three things, then, Japan’s great ability,
its organizational experience and its severe trials,
qualify it to be both a center of light and a center
of centripetal force.*

In saying this, the Guardian said that he felt
that if we just looked at the amazing progress the
Faith had made in Japan in the past two years, we
would naturally agree with these statements.

The Guardian also said that, in order to carry
out its functions, along with Australia, as one of
the two centers, in both senses of that word, in the
Pacific Region, the Japanese Bahá’ís themselves
would first have to strengthen the center of the
teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. The Guardian said that at
* While this one-sentence paragraph helpfully summarizes Mr. Takano’s
points, he does not actually speak this sentence on the tape. In the
aforementioned July 19, 1957 letter to the N.S.A. of Australia, Shoghi
Effendi writes of Japan as ‹‹a country which by reason of its innate
capacity and the spiritual receptivity it has acquired, in consequence of
the severe and prolonged ordeal its entire population has providentially
experienced, is destined to have a preponderating share in awakening
the peoples and races inhabiting the entire Pacific area, to the Message
of Bahá’u’lláh . . .››

that time, what this actually meant was that an NSA
would have to be established in Japan.

This is a bit of a digression, but the Guardian
said that not only did Japan need to establish its
NSA, but that he had such confidence that in the
near future Japan would be added to the list of
NSAs, which at that time included only 12 countries
in the entire world, that he would entrust me with a
present for Japan, even though he had never before
done this unless an NSA was already established in a
country. He said that this present was actually for
Japan once it had established its NSA, but he gave
it to me then, saying that he believed the NSA of
Japan would be established in the near future.

This present is now hanging in the Tokyo Bahá’í
Center. It is a piece of cloth that had lain
directly on the body of Bahá’u’lláh. Actually, it is
only half of this cloth. As I understood it at that
time, the other half went to the other center in the
Pacific Region, that is, to Australia. The Guardian
said that this precious gift to the Bahá’ís of our
area should be put in a frame and displayed for all
to see in the national Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds. This has
been done, and this cloth is still hanging in the
Center in Tokyo.*
* On the tape this paragraph, other than the first sentence (“This present
is now hanging . . .”), is not spoken. In a March 2, 1954 letter written on
behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Local Spiritual Assembly of Tokyo, found in
Japan Will Turn Ablaze! pp. 95-96, it is stated, “The beloved Guardian is
so confident that the Faith will spread rapidly in Japan, and the believers
will firmly establish the institutions of the Cause, that he has chosen to
send to them for ultimate display in the National Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds in Tokyo
one of the very precious relics from the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. He has
entrusted with our dear brother, Hiroyasu Takano, a very precious
brocade, which has rested immediately over the remains of Bahá’u’lláh

What surprised me at the time was that this was
done in spite of the fact that there were very few
Bahá’ís in Japan at that time. I went back and
looked at the records of Japan at the time, and
found that there were only Bahá’ís in Tokyo and
Yokohama in the Kanto area, and in Kyoto, Amagasaki
and Kobe in the Kansai area, and perhaps only two or
three LSAs, and yet at that point, Shoghi Effendi
could confidently state that we would have an NSA.
This really moved me. I believe that this fact will
also help you understand how much the Guardian
anticipated from, and trusted in Japan.*

Now, as to the problem of what actual measures
were needed to establish an NSA in Japan, the
Guardian said in a country like Japan, strong Bahá’í
communities should first be raised in areas like
Tokyo and Osaka. Then, he said, from these strong
communities, as many Bahá’ís as possible should be
dispersed — “dispersed” is the word he used‡ — to
in His glorious Shrine. It is very precious and very sacred. The Guardian
is sending this to the Spiritual Assembly of Tokyo as a gift. The friends
may wish to have it carefully and beautifully framed for display in the
Ḥaẓíra, when it is acquired. Ultimately of course it is to be hung in the
Ḥaẓíra of the National Assembly, when that great goal has been achieved
by the Japanese believers.” For more on the brocade see Appendix 1.
The Tokyo Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds was acquired in December 1954.
* Aside from the last sentence, this paragraph is not spoken on the tape.
The Regional Spiritual Assembly of North East Asia, with its seat in Tokyo,
was first elected in 1957; its jurisdiction was Japan, South Korea, Taiwan,
Hong Kong, and Macau, and its establishment fulfilled a goal of the Ten-
Year Crusade (1953-63). In 1974 the Regional Assembly ceased to exist
and the N.S.A. of Japan was elected for the first time: the culmination of a
process in which, one by one, the North East Asia communities
established their own Assemblies.
‡ On the tape Mr. Takano uses the English word “disperse” and then the

radiate out like light to* nearby areas to serve as
isolated centers.

He likened these isolated centers to the points
of ink made as a pen hits a piece of paper in
writing. When the pen moves, these points become
lines and letters, then letters come together as
words, and the words come together to form
sentences. In this comparison, the sentences would
be the NSAs. To make an NSA, you need as many points
as possible, so he strongly emphasized that at
first, what is important is the points, that is, the
dispersed individuals.‡

He also said that the dispersed individuals
should be like mercury, and hold themselves together
in tight little balls. He admonished that it is very
important to not be like jelly and collapse.¶

The Guardian always spoke in this kind of easily
understood examples.◊
Japanese equivalent.
* On the tape Mr. Takano does not say “radiate out like light to”.
‡ Former Universal House of Justice member ‘Alí Nak͟hjavání refers to a
letter written in Persian and dated Naw-Rúz 1954 (soon after Mr.
Takano’s pilgrimage) in which Shoghi Effendi compares the isolated
believer to a point, a group to a letter of the alphabet, a Local Spiritual
Assembly to a word, a National Spiritual Assembly to a sentence, and the
Universal House of Justice to the “Luminous Book”, further urging the
Bahá’ís to achieve this progression during the Ten-Year Crusade: see the
document “Shoghi Effendi: The Range and Power of His Pen”, p. 254
(PDF p. 265), available at www.bahai-library.com/

its-relationship-to-the-teaching-work.
¶ On the tape Mr. Takano says neither “and hold themselves together in
tight little balls” nor “and collapse”.
◊ On the tape Mr. Takano does not speak this sentence.

The Guardian stressed that once a community
reached a good size, it should have a Bahá’í Center,
a Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds, for that area. In regards to the
importance of the Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds, he emphasized
that it is not just the seat of the center of Bahá’í
administration, but that it is also very important
since it is a center of worship and a center of
spiritual unity as well. He said that on the
national level, there would eventually be a House of
Worship, but that on the local level, the
Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds should function in these three ways:
as a spiritual center, an administrative center and
a center of worship. In this way, the Ḥaẓíratu’l-
Quds is not just a physical thing, and it is very
important to have such centers in the strong
communities throughout Japan.*

As an illustration of this point, Shoghi Effendi
gave the example of some country or other in which,
for some reason or other, the Faith was outlawed and
Bahá’í meetings were banned. In this case, the
Bahá’ís felt it their duty to maintain the
Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds, and later on, when the oppression
ended, this became the driving force in the
rebuilding of the Bahá’í community. From this story,
we can see how important it is to have a Ḥaẓíratu’l-
Quds.

Now, I’d like to move on to a few general points
that do not necessarily directly concern Japan or
the Japanese. The first is the concept of the Bahá’í
World Center that is to be built on the side of
Mount Carmel. At the time I was there, the
construction of the Shrine of the Báb had just been
completed. According to the explanation of the
* On the tape Mr. Takano does not speak this paragraph from “He said
that on the national level” beyond.

Guardian, the Shrine of the Báb is to house the
spiritual center in the total World Center plan,
and, with its completion, the spiritual center at
the World Center had taken shape.

From that time on, we would enter the era for
building the administrative center, he explained.
The actual buildings in the administrative center
will include the Seat of the Universal House of
Justice, the office of the Hands of the Cause, and
so on. And once this is completed, the center of
worship at the World Center, that is, the House of
Worship, will be built. When this is completed, the
World Center will at last be complete, he said. But
at that time, only one of these centers had been
completed.*

By the way, the person who [sic] indicated where
the Shrine of the Báb was to be built was ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá,‡ and that was 60 years before the time of my
pilgrimage. 10 years after that, that is, 50 years
before my pilgrimage, construction began, but it
took that next 50 years before the Shrine was
finally completed. . . .¶

Because of this [i.e., the completion of the
Shrine of the Báb despite many difficulties
encountered], the Guardian had great confidence that
anything that is truly necessary or desirable for
the Faith, and that we really pray for from the

‡ Perhaps there was a misunderstanding on the part of Mr. Takano, as
“where” is the one matter concerning the Shrine of the Báb that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá—or Shoghi Effendi after Him—did not decide: the site was selected
by Bahá’u’lláh (see God Passes By pp. 194, 275).
¶ Several paragraphs concerning difficulties encountered in completing
the Shrine of the Báb have been redacted by the editor (see the
foreword).

bottom of our hearts, will inevitably come to pass.

And this was not vain confidence; he told us that
just this one example should be enough to make us
understand such things clearly.

Next he talked to us about the pattern of all
facets of Bahá’í development that can be seen in
looking back at Bahá’í history. All development in
the Faith follows the same pattern, starting from a
small spark, which then becomes a flame, then a
glowing light, and finally, an explosive force.* The
Guardian said that you can easily see this if you
look at the examples of the number of languages into
which Bahá’í literature has been translated, and the
number of countries that have been opened to the
Faith.

During the 75 years between the time of the
Declaration of the Báb and the close of World War I,
there were not even 40 countries that had been
opened to the Faith. In the 25 years following,
until the end of the second world war [sic], more
than 40 countries were added to this list, more than
doubling the number. But after that, in the nine
years that passed until the year before my
pilgrimage, another 50 were added; then, in the
following one year alone, 90 more were added, so
that, at that time, 218 countries‡ were opened to
* On the tape Mr. Takano gives the pattern or sequence, using the
English words for the first three, as “spark”, “lamp”, “crystal globe”, and
explosive force.
‡ Statistics recorded by Mr. Takano are given as they are. Sources such
as The Bahá’í World volumes and Bahá’í Faith, The: 1844-1963:
Information Statistical and Comparative contain authoritative information
in this regard. The figure of 218 may refer to countries (i.e., sovereign
states) and also—or more correctly—to territories, a term which is used in
the Guardian’s messages and in other Bahá’í sources and which

the Faith. In the future, this number would continue
to grow until it becomes an explosive force, the
Guardian said with firm conviction.

Next, I’d like to relate some of the things the
Guardian said about Bahá’í teaching. He said that,
in the first place, Bahá’í teaching is not done by
the spoken word, it should be done through actions
and character. If we first empty ourselves and then
try to follow the teachings of God which were
revealed to us through the Prophets*, we will,
according to the extent of our exertions, become
exemplars of the divine nature of God. Because other
people will become attracted to this divine nature,
they will feel God, seek Him out and come to believe
in Him.

To be able to teach through actions and
character, the most important thing for us to do is
study God Himself, as revealed through the
Prophets*, for ourselves. However, to do this,
translations should be particularly emphasized in
Japan, the Guardian said. First of all, such works
as the Gleanings, the Kitáb-i-Íqán, and Some
Answered Questions by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá should be
translated into Japanese. Then, the Japanese should
read them so thoroughly that they can recite all the
important passages from memory, he said. This is the
encompasses various polities and places such as dependencies,
colonies, principalities, islands, and, depending on the passage,
countries.
* On the tape Mr. Takano uses the Japanese equivalent of “prophet(s)”.
The Japanese language does not distinguish between the singular and
plural grammatical numbers by inflection, and as such it is possible all
Prophets are referred to here, but it is likely the reference is actually to
Bahá’u’lláh, in which case perhaps “Manifestation” would be a better
choice in both languages.
start of teaching.*

Next, I’d like to talk about the standards of
Bahá’í behavior. The Guardian told us, in a humorous
vein, that, very briefly, the way Bahá’ís should
decide how to act is to do everything just the
opposite of what the non-Bahá’ís are doing. For
example, the present world is full of hatred, and
war never ceases, so Bahá’ís should love one
another, help one another and try to live even just
a little bit more peacefully. Also, the whole world
is leaning towards materialism, concentrating only
on the large cities, and seeking only material
comfort. Bahá’ís should go in the opposite
direction, valuing spirituality, placing importance
on the human heart, dispersing throughout the
countryside, where there is more contact with
nature, and seeking a lifestyle more befitting of
man.

Also, the Guardian said that in the teachings of
Bahá’u’lláh, it is emphasized that entertainment
should be reduced, that we should go to bed early at
night and wake up early in the morning, and that we
should work hard.

Concerning the relationship between Bahá’ís and
politics, the Guardian said that Bahá’ís should
rigorously strive to remove themselves from politics
and especially from political power. He emphasized
that today’s politics are way too full of hatred,
too full of Machiavellian deception, and are also
very devisive [sic], so it is also important to
follow this law in order to escape from the
influence of politics.‡
* On the tape Mr. Takano does not speak this last sentence.
‡ On the tape Mr. Takano does not use the term “Machiavellian”; also, he
does not say “law” but rather “thing” or “matter”, the referent of which is

Moreover, he said that it is not only all right
for Bahá’ís to explain this Bahá’í position to
governments that have political power and to
opposition parties seeking political power to make
sure that they understand this principle, but that
it is actually important that Bahá’ís take positive
steps in this direction.*

However, even though we say that the Bahá’í
world is strictly a spiritual realm, when time has
passed and at last the whole world has become
Bahá’í, of course, the political affairs of the
whole world will be carried out according to the
Bahá’í order, being brought before the local house
of justice [sic] and handled there.‡

This could be taken as meaning that the fact
that we must separate ourselves from political
affairs is just a matter of convenience, and that
Bahá’í is actually a political group, a group with
political motives. However, the Guardian said that
it must be realized that the Bahá’í administrative
the principle of non-involvement in politics mentioned at the beginning of
the paragraph.
* There are many sources that have compiled from the messages and
letters of the infallible authorities the formal Bahá’í perspective on politics:
see, for example, the volume Lights of Guidance and the document
available at www.bahai-library.com/
khan_political_noninvolvement_obedience.
‡ On the tape Mr. Takano says “Bahá’í administrative order” (バハイ行政
秩序 bahai gyo̅sei chitsujo), not simply “Bahá’í order”; further, he says
“the House of Justice at each level” (各層の正義院 kaku so̅ no seigiin),
meaning either (i.e., as appropriate) the local, national, or universal, not
simply “Local House of Justice”. Also he uses the English term “political
affairs” before giving the Japanese equivalent. (In the context of the
future Bahá’í Administrative Order, of course, “political affairs” does not
mean partisan political issues but rather the general affairs of the polity.)

order cannot be understood using existing political
concepts and notions.

For example, some may take the existing
political concept that is most similar to Bahá’í,
namely, democracy, and, seeing that the two concepts
resemble each other, decide that they are almost the
same. However, he explained that they are decidedly
different in at least the following two respects.

The first difference is that, whereas democracy
is a concept that starts from the premise that there
are differences of opinion and conflicts of interest
rooted in fundamentally different viewpoints and
ideologies, and which tries to achieve a balance of
power between these, the fundamental concept on
which the Bahá’í administrative order is founded is
that it is basically impossible to have conflicts of
interests and differences of opinions.

The second point of difference lies in the fact
that, whereas democracy solves problems arising from
conflicts of interest and opinion that can’t be
resolved in any other way by appealing to the people
and deciding according to majority opinion, in the
Bahá’í world, if, unfortunately, it should happen
that conflicting or differing opinions should arise,
it is said that the solution should be entrusted to
the House of Justice. Thus, in these two ways, the
Bahá’í order is fundamentally different from
democracy. So, the Guardian strongly warned that,
even if it is similar externally, the Bahá’í order
should not be identified with politics or political
power.*
* In a number of the Guardian’s works, such as in the compilation volume
The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, pp. 18ff. and 152-154, the Bahá’í
Administrative Order is contrasted with various secular forms of
government and ecclesiastical organizations.

Finally, the Guardian also said that the history
of all true religions follows the same basic
principle, that is, that all new religions, when
they are first brought into the world, have life and
are the driving force behind a culture. They also
serve as the force that sets a standard for human
life. But, as time passes, before one is really
aware of it, they lose their power, and gradually,
they become a social or material force, their
spirituality wanes, and finally, even their life as
a religion is lost. Then, the birth of a new divine
religion is awaited in this world to take the place
of the old one. This is the Bahá’í outlook on the
religions of the past as well as on the history of
the Faith itself.*

Finally, the Guardian said that someone had
called the Guardianship the fruit of the Bahá’í
Faith, but the Guardian said that this is a mistake.
If the Prophet is compared to the root and the
Master to the trunk, then the Guardianship is the
branches. The branches actually raise the height of
the whole tree, and make it visible from afar, but
are different from the actual goal or purpose of the
tree. The purpose of this tree is world order, and
in that respect, the administrative order can be
compared to the tree’s blossoms. Thus, when the
world order, which is the fruit of the tree, appears
the Bahá’í civilization will also come into being.

In comparing the Bahá’í civilization to
* On the tape Mr. Takano does not speak this last sentence but rather
says, “Religions have this sort of fundamental principle” (宗教は斯う言う
風な一つの原則を持っている shu̅kyo̅ wa ko̅yu̅fu̅ na hitotsu no gensoku
wo motteiru)—viz., the principle, borne out in the history of religion, of
decline and birth anew. Shoghi Effendi treats this theme formally in a
number of his general letters.

civilizations up until now, he said that we will
find two decided differences. First, he said that in
the Bahá’í civilization, emphasis will be placed on
the spirit. Secondly, the Bahá’í civilization will
be universal in nature, not at all localized.

And finally, I would like to include a point I
did not actually cover at the Convention. I’d like
to add one remaining point the Guardian made about
Japan. When the Japanese Bahá’ís spread the Bahá’í
Faith in Japan, he said they must take great care in
building up the organization, since the organization
is very important. Also, he said that the Japanese
Bahá’ís should not be in too much of a hurry to
spread the teachings. For example, in securing new
members, he said that we should make sure not only
that they are sincere, but that we should also
select people of good character. He also said that
if we are in too much of a hurry and unconditionally
accept people, even if they’re not of good
character, eventually this will come close to
obstructing the development of the Faith itself in
Japan.

Also, he said that Japan, at the same time that
it must become a center for teaching to Soviet
Russia, it would also, in the future, come to bear
the responsibility of sending pioneers to the
islands in the Pacific Ocean, to Taiwan, China,
Manchuria, Mongolia, Sakhalin and other areas.

Even now, the words of the Guardian continue to
move me, so I’ve taken this opportunity to put them
down on tape once more. Thank you very much for your
time.*
* On the tape Mr. Takano does not speak this final paragraph but rather
employs a short expression commonly used in Japanese to signal the end
of a spoken or written matter. The talk ends here.

Afterword

It seems the English-language translation of Mr. Takano’s talk was
sent to the World Center, the following being the acknowledgment, dated
August 12, 1980, addressed by the secretariat of the Universal House of
Justice to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Japan, found
in the volume Selected Communications from the Universal House of
Justice Concerning the North East Asia Area Including Japan p. 23. The
translation was probably sent to the World Center by then-member of the
Asian Board of Counsellors, the late Rúḥu’lláh Mumtází, in whose
personal archive the editor (who was looking there with the permission of
his daughter) found the copy of the translation typescript that was used
for this PDF document.

Through the courtesy of the Counsellors of North-eastern Asia

The “attraction” and “illumination” in the last sentence of the
Secretariat’s letter correspond, respectively, to the centripetal force and
radiating light of which Mr. Takano states Shoghi Effendi spoke (see page
10 herein). Also, the letter acknowledges receipt “of an English translation
of the pilgrim notes made by Mr. Hiroyasu Takano” and refers to “the
account of his [Haifa] experience given by Mr. Takano at your last
Convention”, but the editor assumes that what was sent to the World
Center is the translation of the post-National Convention tape-recorded
talk—i.e., the translation contained in this PDF document—and not that of
notes taken in Haifa or of the Convention talk. (Concerning the translation
see the foreword.)

Appendix 1: 1977 Recollections

The following describes content in Mr. Takano’s 1977 tape-recorded
pilgrimage recollections (see the foreword) that is not heard in the 1980
tape-recording and does not appear in the translation herein; i.e., content
that is exclusive to the ’77 recording. While much of the two recordings is
identical or very similar, the ’77 talk is somewhat longer.

First Mr. Takano gives historical background and context to the sites
in the Holy Land, quoting from the Japanese edition of Bahá’u’lláh and the
New Era, and describes Haifa. He states he arrived at Haifa on February
22, 1954; stayed at the Western Pilgrim House; attended dinner meetings
with the Guardian at the Pilgrim House on the 22nd, 25th, 26th, 27th,
March 1st, and 2nd; visited the Shrine of the Báb on the 23rd, 25th, 26th,
27th, 28th, 1st, and 2nd; visited the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh at Bahjí and the
other holy sites in ‘Akká and vicinity on the 23rd and the 24th, having
spent the night at Bahjí, and once again on the 3rd; and departed for
Japan on the 3rd. Although their periods of stay did not entirely coincide
with his, he mentions fellow pilgrims Loyce Lawrence, Maud and Albert
Reimholz, and Irene Bennett, pictured on the title page of this PDF
document. (Incidentally, Ms. Lawrence’s given name is correctly “Loyce”,
not “Joyce” as it appears in some Bahá’í sources. It is listed as “Loyce” on
the Roll of Knights of Bahá’u’lláh and is so pronounced by Mr. Takano.)
He also refers to a dinner for diplomats based in Haifa given by Amatu’l-
Bahá Rúḥíyyih K͟ hánum on the 24th, to which the pilgrims were invited,
and comments admiringly on her abilities as a hostess.

Concerning the Guardian’s remarks on Japan, Mr. Takano recalls
him stating that Japan, in addition to functioning, together with Australia to
the south, as both the pole of a magnet and a radiating center for the
Pacific region, should also, together with Germany to the west, America to
the north, and India and Iran to the south, function in the same two ways
for the Soviet Union. Also, until such time as the National Spiritual
Assembly is elected (which happened in 1957), the Tokyo Spiritual
Assembly should function, de facto, with national responsibility, its
committees, such as the translation, education, and dispersing (sic),
having national purview. (Mr. Takano says “disperse committee”, using
the English word “disperse”, about which see page 14 herein.)

Mr. Takano stresses, in both the 1977 and ’80 talks, that some of
the issues the Guardian raised in 1954 may, by 1977 or ’80, be
considered outdated. He does not give examples, but the reference to the
national responsibilities of the Tokyo Assembly would be so (and also,
from a current perspective, the reference to the Soviet Union—if perhaps
not the now-independent countries which at that time constituted its
republics).

On more general matters, Mr. Takano recalls the Guardian saying
that all things should be in moderation, not taken to extremes. For
instance, patriotic sentiment must not become nationalism, nor religious
belief fanaticism.

Finally, Mr. Takano speaks about the precious cloth he was
presented by the Guardian. This matter is mentioned more briefly in the
1980 talk, although the translation of the talk (see page 13 herein) goes
into more detail on its own. While in the translation Australia is identified
as the country which received another piece of the same cloth, in neither
the original 1977 or ’80 talks does Mr. Takano name the country. In the
’77 talk Mr. Takano states that the cloth was divided in two and he thinks
the other piece presented to the N.S.A. of a country with a historical
relationship with Japan, but that he cannot remember what country it was.
The two-piece cloth is mentioned in published Bahá’í works on Japan,
such as Traces that Remain (p. 135), but the other recipient national
community is not named, and it would be interesting to know the source
for this information in the translation.

Appendix 2: Geo-spiritual Motifs

Shoghi Effendi in his messages, and more informally in his table
talks, has propounded several what might be called geo-spiritual motifs,
which can be defined (quite unrigorously, not having been thoroughly
thought through by this editor) as passages in which spiritual themes are
expressed in geographic terms or in which geographic loci are associated
by symbol, metaphor, or anagogue with spiritual verities. The nine
concentric circles centered on the Holy Land are a prime example, as
described in Citadel of Faith pp. 95-96:

‹‹For, just as in the realm of the spirit, the reality of the Báb has
> been hailed by the Author of the Bahá’í Revelation as “The Point
> round Whom the realities of the Prophets and Messengers revolve,”
> so, on this visible plane, His sacred remains constitute the heart
and center of what may be regarded as nine concentric circles . . .

The outermost circle in this vast system, the visible counterpart
> of the pivotal position conferred on the Herald of our Faith, is none
> other than the entire planet. Within the heart of this planet lies the
> “Most Holy Land,” acclaimed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as “the Nest of the
> Prophets” and which must be regarded as the center of the world
> and the Qiblih of the nations. Within this Most Holy Land rises the
> Mountain of God of immemorial sanctity, the Vineyard of the Lord,
> the Retreat of Elijah, Whose return the Báb Himself symbolizes.
> Reposing on the breast of this holy mountain are the extensive
> properties permanently dedicated to, and constituting the sacred
> precincts of, the Báb’s holy Sepulcher. In the midst of these
> properties, recognized as the international endowments of the Faith,
> is situated the most holy court, an enclosure comprising gardens
> and terraces which at once embellish, and lend a peculiar charm to,
> these sacred precincts. Embosomed in these lovely and verdant
> surroundings stands in all its exquisite beauty the mausoleum of the
> Báb, the shell designed to preserve and adorn the original structure
> raised by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as the tomb of the Martyr-Herald of our
> Faith. Within this shell is enshrined that Pearl of Great Price, the
> holy of holies, those chambers which constitute the tomb itself, and
> which were constructed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Within the heart of this
> holy of holies is the tabernacle, the vault wherein reposes the most
holy casket. Within this vault rests the alabaster sarcophagus in

which is deposited that inestimable jewel, the Báb’s holy dust. So
> precious is this dust that the very earth surrounding the edifice
> enshrining this dust has been extolled by the Center of Bahá’u’lláh’s
> Covenant, in one of His Tablets in which He named the five doors
> belonging to the six chambers which He originally erected after five
> of the believers associated with the construction of the Shrine, as
> being endowed with such potency as to have inspired Him in
> bestowing these names, whilst the tomb itself housing this dust He
> acclaimed as the spot round which the Concourse on high circle in
adoration.›› [Italics added.]

Another example of a geo-spiritual motif is the Pacific axis. As
suggested herein in the footnote on page 10, the center of centripetal
force or attraction Mr. Takano states Shoghi Effendi spoke of is a
reference to this axis, a motif introduced by Shoghi Effendi in the passage
from the July 1957 letter to the National Spiritual Assembly of Australia
quoted in the footnote (‹‹an axis whose northern and southern poles will
act as powerful magnets, endowed with exceptional spiritual potency››),
but perhaps first alluded to in an October 1953 message to the Asian
Intercontinental Teaching Conference held in New Delhi—see Messages
to the Bahá’í World, 1950-1957 pp. 163-169—where the Pacific polarity of
Japan and Australia is pointed to:

> ‹‹These opening stages in the evolution of His Faith in the Asiatic
> continent were followed, while the first and Apostolic Age of His
> Dispensation was drawing to a close, by the opening of the islands
> situated in the Pacific Ocean, Japan in the north, and the Australian
continent in the south.››

Another geo-spiritual motif is the light of Revelation and its
continental and oceanic loci—cf. the center of radiating light or
illumination Mr. Takano states Shoghi Effendi spoke of—as elucidated in
the letter “America and the Most Great Peace” and found in the
compilation volume The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh pp. 78-79 (and also
treated separately in God Passes By p. 253), where Shoghi Effendi brings
together two originally separate verses of Bahá’u’lláh:

> “In the East the light of His Revelation hath broken; in the West the
> signs of His dominion have appeared.” [And] “Should they attempt
> to conceal its light on the continent, it will assuredly rear its head in
the midmost heart of the ocean, and, raising its voice, proclaim, ‘I

> am the life-giver of the world!’”
> While in “America and the Most Great Peace” (also in God Passes
By) Shoghi Effendi associates the phrase from the former verse, “in the
West the signs of His dominion have appeared”, with the establishment of
the Faith in North America, the Universal House of Justice has stated—
see Messages from the Universal House of Justice, 1968-1973 pp. 74-75;
Messages from the Universal House of Justice, 1963-1986 pp. 564, 635
—that the latter verse (“Should they attempt . . .” ) holds a ‹‹promise of
Bahá’u’lláh›› and has related the phrase “midmost heart of the ocean”
generally to the islands of the Pacific region mentioned in the Tablets of
the Divine Plan, has related it particularly to the Samoa House of Worship,
has indicated that the fulfillment of this promise of the Pacific is an
ongoing process, and has further forecast

> ‹‹a brilliant future in the Pacific for His Faith, whose quickening light
is casting its rays on the peoples of this vast ocean.››

In the pilgrim’s notes of Núru’d-Dín Mumtází—online at www.bahai-
library.com/mumtazi_twin_pilgrimages—Shoghi Effendi is quoted, in
remarks to a group of Persian pilgrims including Mr. Mumtází, specifically
identifying the referents of the phrases “light on the continent” and
“midmost heart of the ocean” as Írán and Japan, respectively. (Mr.
Mumtází was a pioneer in Japan; his son was Counsellor Rúḥu’lláh
Mumtází, mentioned in the afterword.) The following is Núru’d-Dín
Mumtází’s original English-language recollection, from his above-
mentioned online notes pp. 127-128:

In the afternoon of 27th December [1955] our beloved Guardian
> came toward the gardens of the [Eastern] Pilgrim House and called
> us into his presence. We now had the privilege of walking with him.
> [He said to us,] “The Faith of God will make great progress in Japan
> as Bahá’u’lláh has promised us. He [Bahá’u’lláh] said, ‘If you cover
> the light in the middle of the earth it will come out from the middle of
> oceans and seas and it will speak unto you saying, “Behold, I am
the light and the savior of the world!”’”

Our beloved Guardian then explained what this meant: “By the
> middle of the earth,” he said, “Bahá’u’lláh meant Írán, which is in the
> middle of Asia; by the middle of oceans and the seas He meant
> Japan, which is an island among the ocean[s] and seas.” He [the
Guardian] then added that if they would try to hide the Faith of God

in Persia it will appear and come out from Japan saying, “I am the
true light and the savior of mankind!”

In both the “America and the Most Great Peace” and the pilgrim’s
notes quotations, the Revelation seems more to have been zoomorphized
than geographicalized, as if it were a loving, luminous Godzilla,
suppressed in the Asian heartland and instead rising and shining out of
the Pacific Ocean, roaring and radiating redemption.

Further to the motif of the locus of radiating light, it is noteworthy
that in a message—see Japan Will Turn Ablaze! p. 80—to the first
Convention of the Bahá’ís of North East Asia, held in Tokyo in April 1957
and at which the first Regional Spiritual Assembly of North East Asia was
elected, Shoghi Effendi states

> ‹‹I particularly welcome the establishment of this highly important
> institution in the capital city of Japan, as it affords a splendid
opportunity for the diffusion of the Lights [sic] of the Faith . . .››

Lastly, although it may often be too generalized to qualify as geo-
spiritual, a term recurring in the messages and letters and talks of Shoghi
Effendi is the center, with many different nuances of meaning or
applications: in Mr. Takano’s account, alone, one can find the centripetal
center, the radiating center, the isolated center, the Bahá’í Center, the
World Center, the spiritual center, the administrative center, the center of
worship, and the center for teaching. (Of course it is possible some of
these are Mr. Takano’s expressions rather than terms Shoghi Effendi
actually used in his remarks.)

Surely the theme of the center is deserving of diligent study, but an
elaboration here would be beyond the scope of this document (and the
capabilities of this editor). Any such study would have to consider the
intriguing references made by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (Himself the Center of the
Covenant) to the “collective center”, found in Tablets of the Divine Plan
pp. 101-102, 105-106 and in talks He gave in North America—a concept
which seems to have both ontological and sociological ramifications.
