### Preliminary analysis of the Alice Dudley notes, columns 1 and 5

#### Thellie Lovejoy

The Alice Dudley notes are a very interesting collection of notes. They provide for us a good study of the types of changes one typist would introduce into the notes in order to copy them in the pre-photocopy days. None of the notes displayed here are of the original typing made by Alice Dudley. If we had that we would call it the original or first generation. The five different typings found in column three through five are all then at least second generation typings and none of the five are typed from each other. Column one notes are, it appears, typed from the column five notes. Therefore, column one notes can be called third generation notes and in this case it appears are typed from column five.

It is an interesting study to compare the one typings with each other. Each of the five second generation notes have individually deleted information in them that appear in at least two of the other three columns. It is by studying what has been deleted in each of the five columns that we can be certain none of the five has been typed from any one of the other three. In addition to deleting, either intentionally and often unintentionally, the typist would occasionally alter or even add words. What is "beyond" in three sets of notes could become "far beyond" in the fifth. Or it can go the other way. You could have "far beyond" in three typings and "beyond" in the fifth. "Retributive" in three of the typings is "retribution" in column five. They also changed the length of the paragraphs from one typing to the next. As they were speeding along typing, they would forget to break for a new paragraph, putting two paragraphs together. Or, perhaps, they would add the last sentence of one paragraph of to the beginning of the next.

By tracking the various alterations and omissions, we can tell from what second generation notes that our third generation notes have come.

Column number one, the third generation notes, had a typist who intentionally deleted all references to person's names. Columns three through five have these names so none of the five could have come from column one. But what column notes did number one come from?

1.  Column number one has no additional information in it that is not included in column number five, but it does have information that is deleted individually in each of the other three columns.
2.  Column number one, except in the instances where the typist has intentionally altered sentences with names, has all of the remaining alterations that are found in the column five notes. The strongest evidence is found in the sentence, "The coming calamity would be retribution." In columns two, three, and four, this sentence is found as the last sentence of one paragraph. With the word "retributive" instead. "The coming calamity would be retributive." Both columns five and one have this sentence as the first sentence in the following paragraph with the word "retribution" instead of "retributive".

Since the column five could not have come from column one because of the names being dropped in column one and retained in five, and column one cannot come from any of the other three columns as it has information in it that they individually do not have, it is found that column one is third generation coming from the column five notes.

| \[no text here in this version.\] | One of the characteristics of the Guardian is his amazing memory. He has statistics of every kind pertaining to activities in all areas of the world at his finger tips and he quotes them constantly. He is especially happy over the progress of the Faith in the Pacific area. It surpasses even Africa now. He kept reiterating the goals of the various areas stating what progress had been made, what goals had been surpassed and when they lagged.

To give an idea how fast the Guardian works - when the Israeli court awarded the house at Bahji which had been occupied by Coveneant Breakers, to the Bahá'ís - that very same day the decree was pronounced the Guardian had the house demolished and every portion of it carried away. And within 4 1/2 days he created a formal garden 12 1/2 meters wide and 80 meters long. In the process of making the garden he had a row of large trees uprooted by bulldozers, raised the garden 1 meter, built roads, paths, installed lighting, made terraces, placed statuary and planted trees, flowers, and shrubbery according to design. All this in 4 1/2 days.

The Guardian described the uniqueness of the dome of the Bab's tomb. It is Renassance with a blending of Italian architecture.

The decline of Islam is beginning - they will be punished for their treatment of the Bab and Bahá'u'lláh.

| Guardian said:

That evening the Guardian began speaking about the coming calamity. He was very emphatic and after he left, Ruhiyyih Khanum and the members of the International Council stated that they had never heard him speak with such force and so decisively. He said the coming calamity would be worse than war. Cities would evaporate, especially in the cities where it is hardest to teach the Faith, such as New York, Chicago and San Francisco. Americans would become refugees to other continents. The United States would suffer the most because it was the most materialistic. Europe was the cradle of materialism but the United States was the stronghold of materialism. Russia would also suffer greatly. He said there was no difference between Russia and the United States in their systems because they were both materialistic.. capitalism which is purely materialistic and communism, which controls the proletariate. The coming calamity would be retributive.

'Abdu'l-Bahá went to the United States to especially awaken the nation to its danger. His Mission was a failure ... both from the stand-point of the Bahá'ís and the Americans. That can be discerned by reading between the lines of his addresses in America. The Faith will be spread by the dark-skinned races, by the so-called un-civilized peoples. The Bahá'ís of the United States are going through a transitional period, and they will be in the position of spectators in the spread of the Faith in comparison with the spread of the Faith in Africa and among the yellow- skinned races.

Speaking again about the calamity, the Guardian said it was retributive and referred to the passage in the Hidden Words: 'O Ye Peoples of the world! Know verily that an unforeseen calamity is following you and that grievous retribution awaiteth you." and to the quotation: "And when the appointed hour is come, there shall suddenly appear that which shall cause the limbs of mankind to quake". It especially applies to the United States because of the importance of the United States. It is now America's turn to suffer. Referring to the coming cataclysm, the Guardian stated the world needs a blood-letting because of over-population of such countries as China, India, Japan.... Referred to it as high blood pressure and also to the unhealthy condition of many of the people ... bad blood. Sally Sanor asked if in the future when there would be no more war, would there be a problem of over-population, the Guardian replied that science by that time would have solved the food problem.

 | About the coming calamity: He was very emphatic. After he left the table, Ruhiyyih Khanum and other members of the International Council said they had never heard him speak with so much force or so decisevily. He said the coming calamity would be worse than war. Cities would evaporate, especially those cities where it is hardest to teach the Faith such as N.Y., Chicago, and S.F. People will lose all their possessions and homes overnight - will simply evaporate. Americans will become refugees to other continents. The U.S. will suffer the most because it is the most materialistic. Europe was the cradle of materialism but the U.S. is its stronghold. Russia will also suffer greatly. He said there is no difference between Russia and the U.S. in their economic systems - both are materialistic. Capitalism is purely materialistic and communism controls the proletariat. The coming calamity will be retributive .

'Abdu'l-Bahá went to the U.S. to waken the nation to its dangers. His mission was a failure - both from the standpoint of the Bahá'ís and the other citizens. That can be discerned by reading between the lines of his addresses in America.

The Faith will be spread by the dark-skinned races, by the so-called uncivilized peoples.

The Bahá'ís of the U.S. are going through a transitional period and they will be in a position of spectators in the spread of the Faith in comparison with the spread of the Faith in Africa and among the yellow races. Speaking again about the calamity, the Guardian said it was retributive and referred to the passage in the Hidden Words - "all of a sudden the unforseen calamity" and to the quotation in Gleanings that "the limbs of mankind will quake." It especially applies to the U.S. because of the importance of the U.S. It is now America's turn to suffer. Referring to the coming cataclysm, the Guardian stated that the world needs a blood-letting because of over population in China, India, Japan. He referred to it as high blood pressure and also to the unhealthy conditions of many of the people - bad blood, etc. Sally S. asked if in the future when there would be no more war, would there be a problem of overpopulation and Guardian replied that science by that time would have solved the food problem.

| The Guardian stated that the United States was chosen as the cradle of the World Order (Administrative Order) not because of its spiritual qualities but because of its corruption, the same as Persia was chosen for the Revelation because they, the Persians, were worse than African savages, far more barbaric.

After the coming of the calamity, the United States will fulfill the prophecy of 'Abdu'l-Bahá that the United States will lead the other nations because of its suffering. The Guardian said he had given up warning the friends because

they paid no heed to him. Furthermore, that this calamity had been destined. The Guardian stated that 'Abdu'l-Bahá had warned the friends but they were heedless.

It is too late to save the world. The message of Bahá'u'lláh has been in the world for over one hundred years and has been rejected. The calamity will be sudden.

He spoke of our statesmen from the President down, all were helpless and impotent.. Also stated that we were not an altruistic nation... We (Americans) were helping other countries to save ourselves. The Guardian said the submarines built by Russia will paralyse the United Kingdom, Western Europe, the Mediterranean, the Pacific and Atlantic Seaboards. He stated that the United States did not wish to coalese with other nations.. only wished to protect herself. Bahá'ís have failed with the Negro race in the United States. There should have been more inter-marriage.

He spoke of the large deficit of the Fund. (Jessie Revell said we should give every month. The size of the contribution has nothing to do with it. One contribution to the International Fund was for $.35)\[other notes say $1.35\]

Speaking of love... The Americans love money, their wives, their homes, their possessions, their friends. Just as there is a decline in the U.S. Dollar, there is also a decline in their morals and home life.

| The Guardian said the calamity would happen before the Lesser Peace. He said the American Bahá'ís should not only leave their homes but should go as far away as possible. Victories come only from sacrifice and self-abnegation. The greater the sacrifice, the greater the victory. Bahá'ís should lower their standard of living in order to give more. I asked the Guardian if the calamity could be averted. He replied, "No". I asked if it would be all over of North America, and he said mostly the United States.

The night of Ridvan, the Guardian started the conversation by saying he had received over 100 telegrams from Assemblies all over the world. He mentioned specifically Salzburg, Innesbruck, Milan, Hiroshima Edna True cabled to say Luxemburg had acquired its Hazira. The Guardian cabled back and asked her. "What about Stockholm, Lisbon and translation into Lapp language?"

Isobel Sabri asked the Guardian what the attitude towards missionaries should be. (She is pioneering in Africa). The Guardian replied we must be careful with governments and reckless with missionaries. The Guardian repeated several times that settlers should come to France and the Scandinavian countries from the United States.

Sally Sanor asked the Guardian what the employees of the American Army should do in case of an alert some would be evacuated. He said if our jobs interfered with our remaining at our posts, we should change jobs.

One a.m. Leroy Ioas drove us to see the Temple site which is situated on the very top of Mt. Carmel about 2 miles from where the Shrine is located. The site is shaped like a peninsula, overlooking water on 3 sides. The Guardian says the Shrine of the Bab is the heart of Carmel and the Temple will be the head of Mt. Carmel. He said Bahá'u'lláh had stood on the site when He revealed the Tablet of Carmel in such loud ringin tones that the nuns in the Carmelit - Nunnery, situated further below, could hear Him. This site is also near the Cave of Elijah.

| On 28.7. 1957 a copy of the above notes were sent to the Guardian for verification by Seymor Malkin and Pat Gangel. The answer was as follows:

Haifa, Israel  
30.8.1957

Dear Bahá'í Friends:

Your letter of July 28, with enclosure has been received by the Beloved Guardian and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.

It is very indiscreet to let non-Bahá'ís see our Pilgrim Notes, but there is no objection to sharing them with the Bahá'ís. They are not the verbatim words of the Guardian, not a dissertation on his part but parts of a conversation .... as such these notes are fairly accurate.

He appreciates your watchfulness and your desire to protect the teachings.

With warm Bahá'í greetings
