## Quote from Ruhiyyih Khanum to Mrs. J.E. Bolles

### by [Ruhiyyih (Mary Maxwell) Khanum](https://bahai-library.com/author/Ruhiyyih+(Mary+Maxwell)+Khanum)

1953


Washington, Conn., Received June 14, 1953

"There seems to be something about the urgency of this particular time in history that there is just no time left. And if you could have heard the Guardian speak to us at the Western Pilgrim House tonight (we have no pilgrims now) you would have felt that there was not a moment to spare. He was so surprised because 20 people from Uganda, newly opened Negro-populated Uganda, have volunteered to go out as pioneers, and yet, aside from the report of the conference of the number that volunteered in Chicago he has no news, either any names from people themselves, or committees, except Kenneth Christian! Isn't that wonderful that K. Christian has volunteered with his family? Just after spending God knows how many years getting established where he is. This is, if only one example, the spirit he is waiting for. He says, we Americans will regret the day and suffer fir it if we don't go out now when there is this call. He says this is applicable to every one as I see this is something quite new. We, poor humans can't see any further than the end of our noses, but the guidance of God is for our own good, we are getting our chance, the appeal is addressed to the conscience of each single one, with no exceptions, take it or leave it. I think you would be stunned if you could hear him talk, the tone has changed so much this last year and I cannot believe it is because of the great war, or whatever it is that is coming, is coming fast. It is a race against time now. As he says, the friends will be far safer if they can go out to these distant virgin fields than to stay at home in the U.S., the target. We were all quite shaken by the way he spoke."

Dearest Lucy: Mrs. Bolles sent me this and asked me to share it.
