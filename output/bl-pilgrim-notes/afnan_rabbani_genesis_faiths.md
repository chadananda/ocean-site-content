FOREWORD BY TRANSLATOR

> Sanctified be God! The All-Glorious Providence has
> decreed for the land of Sh[íráz] to be the dawning-place
> of light and ﬁre. That is, before God, the appearance of
> these two attributes is most prominent and most evident
> in that realm. And this is because the ﬁre of opposition
> broke forth brightly in that city before it appeared in all
other lands.

—Baháʾuʾlláh1

Background to the Narrative

> In the 1920s in Iran, Mírzá Asaduʾlláh Fádil Mázandarání, a renowned
> scholar and capable historian, undertook a massive project to compose a
> documented history of the Bábí–Baháʾí religions, which he entitled Táríkh
> Zuhúruʾl-Haqq [The History of the Appearance of the True One]—an
> eﬀort that was greatly encouraged by Shoghi Eﬀendi, the Guardian of the
> Baháʾí Faith.2 For his history, Mázandarání needed detailed accounts of
> events and occurrences during the ﬁrst century of the Baháʾí Faith. With
> the aim of gathering such data and documentation, he and others trav-
> eled extensively throughout Iran and vicinity, combing through the Baháʾí
> community for available information, such as tablets, memoirs, letters,
> pictures, narratives, poems, historical sites, and family trees. However,
> Mázandarání recognized that he needed much more information, so he
turned to Shoghi Eﬀendi for assistance.

In the latter part of 1924, Shoghi Eﬀendi began the process of recording
> the recollections of the Baháʾís who had witnessed the early years of the
> Bábí and Baháʾí Movements. Knowing that these memoirs would have a
> profound eﬀect on the understanding of future Baháʾís about the genesis of
> their religion, Shoghi Eﬀendi called for a systematic campaign to assemble

Light is a reference to the Declaration of the Báb in Shíráz. Original Tablet in Núriʾd-
Dín Collection, no. 144, dated 1 Rajab, AH 1307 [21 February 1890].

Shoghi Eﬀendi himself also participated in this enterprise, ﬁrst by producing an elegant
> edited translation of Nabíl Zarandí’s history, The Dawn-Breakers, and later by writing two
> monumental analytical histories of the Bábí–Baháʾí Faiths, respectively entitled God Passes
> By and Lawh-i Qarn [Tablet of the Century].

> such narratives. In the Haifa–ʿAkká area, companions of Baháʾuʾlláh such
> as Áqá Husayn Áshchí [broth-maker] and Áqá Abúʾl-Qásim Bághbán
> [gardener] were interviewed for what they remembered of the formative
> days of the Bábí–Baháʾí Faiths. Sometimes, as in the case of Áshchí, such
interviews happened literally on the person’s deathbed.

During the next two decades, Shoghi Eﬀendi wrote to the Baháʾís of
> Iran urging them to prepare detailed histories of each local community,
> particularly those that had a signiﬁcant Baháʾí presence from the earliest
> days. He further called upon individuals who had witnessed the unfold-
> ing of the Heroic Age (1844–1921) in the “Cradle of the Faith” (Iran)
to record their experiences in writing.

In accordance with this request, the Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʾís of
> Shíráz entrusted the task of writing a comprehensive history of the Baháʾí
> Faith in this central region to Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh Afnán, the hereditary
> custodian of the House of the Báb in Shíráz, who readily obeyed and
> wrote of what he had witnessed and the remarkable stories that he had
> heard from those associated with the founding of the Bábí–Baháʾí Faiths.
Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh notes:

> In accordance with the instructions of the Guardian of the Cause of God
> in his wondrous and blessed letter, which stated: “Each town must write a
> brief history of the Faith since the dawning of the Sun of Horizons,” the
> Spiritual Assembly [of Shíráz] entrusted this service to this unworthy ser-
> vant, Hájí Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh Afnán. Even though this ephemeral servant
> considers himself unprepared for this great enterprise, yet hopeful of the
> divine conﬁrmations of the Beloved, has committed to paper to a prescribed
> degree what he has seen or heard from reliable observers, that the sanctiﬁed
> command of the Guardian be fulﬁlled.3

Fárs and Shíráz

> The land of Fárs is a province that millennia earlier had given birth to
> two great dynasties—the Achaemenian in the sixth century BC and the
> Sassanian in the third century AD. These empires were administered by
> leaders of great insight and learning, and engendered cultivated societ-
> ies, formidable armies, great visions for humanity, and just rulers whose
> achievements were legendary and unprecedented. Indeed, the brilliance
> of their triumphs was so dazzling that the name of the region was

> extended to the entire country, and Persia—from Persis, the Greek form
> of Fárs—was born.4 Therefore, for Persians the name Fárs evokes a deep
> sense of pride and heritage. It calls to mind the past splendors associ-
> ated with that cradle of civilization, when wise rulers from their seat in
> Persepolis wielded authority over a kingdom that extended from North
> Africa to China—kings who governed with such liberty and equity that
> the authors of the Old Testament were prompted to speak most glowingly
of their benevolence.

The language of the nation, Fársí—the language of Fárs—descends lineally
> from the language that Cyrus and Darius spoke and is the language in which
> the proclamations were engraved by their command on the rock-tablets of
> Bí-sitún and Naqsh Rustam, and upon the walls and columns of Perse-
> polis. This language stirs a profound sense of spirituality and reﬁnement
> derived from the poetry of Háﬁz, voice of the invisible and the master of
> Persian lyrical poetry, and Saʿdí, the sweet-tongued poet and the author
> of the famous Gulistán, a book of sonnets called the Garden of Roses. No
> other Iranian writers to this day enjoy—not only in their own country
> but also wherever their language is cultivated—a wider celebrity or a
> greater reputation than these two poets of Shíráz. Indeed, for Iranians,
> there is no Persian language more elevated than that which they have
> learned from Háﬁz and Saʿdí, and deep in their collective consciousness
> the legacy of these two towering literary giants of Shíráz pervades modern
Iranian culture.5

Beyond the circle of Iranians, the Baháʾí world community will forever
> associate the name of Shíráz with the opening chapter of its own history,
> for it was in Shíráz that the initial emanation of the divine revelation
> for this religion broke forth from the merchant-Prophet of that city. The
> Báb, He Who is acclaimed as the “Point round Whom the realities of the
> Prophets and Messengers revolve,”6 Who styled Himself “the Primal Point
> from which have been generated all created things . . . the Countenance of
> God Whose splendor can never be obscured, the Light of God Whose
> radiance can never fade,”7 arose meteor-like over the horizon of Shíráz.

Fárs is the Arabicized version of Párs. Persia and Persian both derive from Persis, the
Hellenized form of the root word Párs. The Old Persian word was Pârsâ.

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh Afnán

> It was in the House of the Báb in Shíráz that Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh Afnán
> (1875–1951) was born and then reared by none other than Khadíjih
> Bagum, the widow of the Báb. The stories that he heard from her were the
> bittersweet stories of the Báb and the deeply devoted disciples who circled
> around the Báb in Shíráz. Khadíjih Bagum had a particular aﬃnity towards
> the young lad’s father, Áqá Mírzá Áqá Núriʾd-Dín, who, at a time when
> tribulations had most ﬁercely beset Khadíjih Bagum, was promised by the
> Báb to be the family member who would arise for her protection and sup-
> port, and who had done just that. This immense love of Khadíjih Bagum
> likewise readily embraced Núriʾd-Dín’s children, and Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh
basked in the brilliance of her attention and aﬀection.

In 1891–92 at the age of 16, Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh was fortunate to be
> able to accompany his family to the Holy Land, where he spent some
> nine months in the immediate proximity of Baháʾuʾlláh in the Mansion of
> Bahjí. Subsequently, from Egypt he remained in constant communication
> for the next decade with ʿAbduʾl-Bahá and periodically visited Him in
> ʿAkká, where as a trusted Afnán he was privy to some of the heart-wrench-
> ing scenes of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s ministry and granted a glimpse into the most
> private inner workings of the Baháʾí Faith—he witnessed the disloyalty
> of the half-brothers of ‘Abduʾl-Bahá, their corrupt ways, the consequent
> anguish of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá, ‘Abduʾl-Bahá’s eﬀorts to conceal their perversion
> and their violation of laws, and the means by which this sad news was
transmitted to the Baháʾí community.

At the turn of the century, in 1902, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá wished for Núriʾd-Dín
> and his family, including his son, Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh, to return to Shíráz
> to rebuild the House of the Báb, which had fallen into disrepair. Shortly
> before the completion of this reconstruction, Núriʾd-Dín passed away, and
> it fell to Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh to complete the construction and to become
> the custodian of that sacred ediﬁce. This was the hallmark service of his
> life, as for the next half-century he served with great distinction as the
> hereditary custodian of the House of the Báb in Shíráz. Consequently, he
> stood uniquely qualiﬁed to tell the story of the Bábí and Baháʾí Movements
> in Shíráz as well as to recount his recollections of the days of Baháʾuʾlláh
> and ‘Abduʾl-Bahá in the Holy Land.

Narratives of Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh Afnán

> Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh wrote two lengthy documents. The date of composition
> of the ﬁrst narrative, entitled Táríkh Amrí Fárs va Shíráz, is not known
> with any degree of precision, although it has been estimated to be in
> the 1920s or possibly in the early- to mid-1930s. The original version
> was handwritten by Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh, and the ﬁnal draft was written
> by Mírzá Abúʾl-Hasan Ansif Nayrízí. This ﬁnal copy was edited by the
> author, whose handwritten remarks are evident along various margins and
> lines throughout the manuscript; this is the version used for translation
purposes.

Of this ﬁrst narrative, unquestionably the most valuable portions are
> those on the life of the Báb in Shíráz, a city acclaimed by the young
> Prophet as the baladuʾl-amn, “the land of refuge.”8 Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh did
> not wish to write a comprehensive history of the Báb’s life, since he knew
> full well that others had already attempted such an undertaking—men

INBMC (Iranian National Baháʾí Manuscript Collection) 91:6–10, no. 3, and
> 91:13–14, no. 4. In chapter 55 of Qayyúmu’l-Asmáʾ, the Báb refers to Himself as the Gate
> of the land of refuge (Báb-i baladu’l-amn). Verse 35 of the chapter “Pillar” (rukn) of the
> same book refers to Shíráz as the baladuʾl-amn.

> like Nabíl Zarandí, surnamed Nabíl Aʿzam, who was well known to Mírzá
> Habíbuʾlláh. Rather, his objective was to tell stories of the Báb’s sublime
> life that were current among the Báb’s immediate family in Shíráz, par-
ticularly reminiscences he had heard from Khadíjih Bagum.9

The second narrative, entitled Khátirát Hayát, is the account of Mírzá
> Habíbuʾlláh’s pilgrimages to the Holy Land and his decade-long stay
> in Egypt. The exact date of the composition of this autobiography is
> unknown, but the author’s sons, Abúʾl-Qásim and Hasan Afnán, indicate
> that it was ﬁrst composed shortly after Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh’s return to
> Iran.10 Based upon the evidence in the narrative and family records, it is
> known that these notes were recopied and reorganized in the mid-1940s.11
> Of this narrative, the most important part is the author’s recollection of
> being near Baháʾuʾlláh from the middle of July 1891 until shortly after
> Naw-Rúz 1892, that is, a little more than two months prior to the passing
> of Baháʾuʾlláh. The remaining portions are singularly important, as they
> clarify many aspects of the ﬁrst decade of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ministry when
the opposition of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s half-brothers was at its height.12

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh was a well-educated man. He attended the same
> school that the Báb had attended and received tuition from one of the
> city’s ablest educators. Baháʾuʾlláh arranged for him to study with His own
> sons in the Mansion of Bahjí. Subsequently, he spent many years receiving
> daily instructions from the celebrated Mírzá Abuʾl-Fadl Gulpáygání, one
> of the most erudite Baháʾís of his generation. Therefore, the style of his
> composition is very learned and represents an important literary achieve-
> ment in its own right. It is hoped that in due course the original Persian
> of these two narratives will also be published so that students of history
> will become better acquainted with his elegant style of composition.13

Those not fully familiar with the story of the Báb may ﬁnd it helpful while reading
> this history to refer to Nabíl’s history, presented in an edited version in The Dawn-Breakers,
> and to Hasan Balyúzí’s biography, The Báb. These volumes describe many of the persons
> and incidents mentioned in this narrative, but depict them in a wider context. For an
academic treatment of the same subject, see Abbas Amanat, Resurrection and Renewal.

Private communications, summer 1985.

For example, Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh notes that ﬁfty-ﬁve years had elapsed since the
> spring of 1892 when he had met Tarazu’llah Samandari in the Holy Land, and assuming
> these years are reckoned in accordance with the lunar calendars, this then places the date

NOTES ON THE PRESENT TRANSLATION

> In the course of this translation, every eﬀort has been exerted to stay as
> close to the original document as possible, to the degree that a literal
> rendering has often been preferred to a more stylistic one. Footnotes have
> been added to augment information, clarify obscure points, and provide a
> more detailed perspective. Occasionally, comments by the translator have
> been added to improve the clarity or continuity of the material. These
> comments are enclosed in square brackets, thus [. . .]. All comments within
> parentheses are by the author, Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh. The numbers in pointed
> brackets, < >, correspond to the Afnán family genealogy in appendix 6.
> The system of transliteration used in this monograph is consistent with
> the method used in other academic publications and varies from the
> system used in most Baháʾí publications by: (1) avoiding subdots and
> underlines (e.g., Fádil), and (2) dropping the izaﬁh connecting the ﬁrst
> name to the surname (e.g., Husayn-ʿAlí Núrí, instead of Husayn-ʿAlíy-i-
> Núrí). The page numbers of the original manuscript are indicated in
square brackets, such as [p. 10], every ﬁve pages.

The following table provides a comparison between pages of the original

xviii             notes on the present translation

> Since any single Islamic year (denoted AH) typically overlaps with two
> Christian years, where only the Islamic year of the event is known, the
> equivalent Gregorian date is given as the ﬁrst of the two years partially
covered by that Islamic year.

Typically, the original text refers to the Central Figures by such honor-
> iﬁc titles as “His Holiness” or “His blessed Person,” and these honoriﬁcs
> have been omitted for the most part. Nor does the translation reproduce
> such expressions commonly used in the Iranian literature of the Baháʾí
> Faith as, “May my life be a sacriﬁce unto His Sacred Threshold.” Many
> key individuals are often referred to by titles, such as His Holiness the
> Exalted One, a reference to the Báb; or the Blessed Perfection or the
> Blessed Beauty, expressions used for Baháʾuʾlláh; or “the exalted wife,”
> a term used to refer to Khadíjih Bagum, the widow of the Báb. These
> titles have been replaced with their more recognizable names, the Báb,
Baháʾuʾlláh, or Khadíjih Bagum.

By the time Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh wrote his narrative, many principal per-
> sonalities featured in this history had died, and the original text therefore
> often refers to them as “the late” or “the deceased.” These terms, too, have
largely been omitted.

Some details of the events recorded in Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh’s chronicle
> diﬀer from those found in Nabíl’s Narrative, the standard history of
> these events. However, given that the chronicle represents an oral tradi-
> tion within the family of the Báb, it has its own importance and must
> form part of the analysis of historians. It should be emphasized that the
> spoken words attributed to the Báb, Baháʾuʾlláh, and ʿAbduʾl-Bahá in
> these pages cannot be ascribed with scriptural authority or equated with
> their authorized Writings. No one took notes at the time those words
> were uttered, although it cannot be ruled out that some may indeed be
the very words spoken.

All renderings of the Sacred Writings from Persian and Arabic, unless
> otherwise speciﬁed, are by the present translator. If an authorized source
> (such as Gleanings) is not cited, then the renderings should be considered
> as falling in the class of provisional translations intended to convey the
> essence (mazmún) of communications by the Founders of the Bábí–Baháʾí
> Faiths. Such summary renderings are not to be confused with full autho-
> rized translation of the Baháʾí Holy Texts, which will be disseminated in
due time by the Baháʾí World Centre.

Regarding these Texts, it should be noted that three major compilations
> have been immensely helpful in locating the original Tablets quoted by
> Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh in his narratives:

CHAPTER ONE

THE CHILDHOOD AND EARLY LIFE OF THE BÁB

The Beginning of the History

The names of the paternal and maternal ancestors of the Báb are as follows: [p.2:1]

The blessed name of the Báb was Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí-Muhammad,15 son of
> Mír[zá] Muhammad-Ridá, the son of Áqá Mír[zá] Nasruʾlláh, the son of
> Áqá Mír[zá] Fathuʾlláh, the son of Áqá Mír[zá] Ibráhím.16 He was born
> into a highly regarded family of Husayní Siyyids17 to whose nobility,
> integrity, trustworthiness, piety, devotion, and detachment everyone in
> the province of Fárs would testify. Merchants by profession, they were
> all considered exemplary in integrity and purity in the entire region of
> Fárs. The mother of the Báb was Fátimih Bagum, the daughter of Hájí
> Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn, who was the son of Áqá Mírzá ʿAbid,18 the
> son of Áqá Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad. This family also ranked among the
> renowned and trustworthy merchants of Fárs.

Early Years

> His blessed birth took place on the ﬁrst night of Muharram AH 1235 [20

October 1819], in the house belonging to His mother’s paternal uncle,

> In the Qayyúmuʾl-Asmáʾ, Surih al-Qarabih [kinsmen], verse 14, the Báb reveals:
> Verily, We have named this Remembrance by two Names from the divine Self, after
> two Beloved Ones among Our servants in the heavens.

The Báb gives a slightly diﬀerent genealogy in Sahíﬁh Baynuʾl-Haramayn (The Treatise
> Between the Two Shrines): “Say: My name is Muhammad after the word ʿAlí [i.e., ʿAlí-
> Muhammad]. And the name of My father, as hath been revealed in the Book of God, is
> Ridá after Muhammad. And the name of My grandfather in the Book of God is Ibráhím
> [Abraham], and his father is named Nasruʾlláh as has been revealed in the Qurʾán (Fathuʾlláh)”
> (Browne Or. MSS F.7[9]). The ﬁnal statement is a reference to Qurʾán 61:13: “And another
> [favor will He bestow], which ye do love—help from God [Nasruʾlláh] or a speedy victory
> [Fathuʾlláh]; so give the glad tidings to the believers.” The same genealogy is given in the
Qayyúmuʾl-Asmáʾ, Surih al-Qaribih, verses 14–15.

That is, this family traced its ancestry to Imám Husayn.

Fayzí, Hadrat Nuqtih Ula, p. 64, gives his name as Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín.

> Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí.19 The oft-recounted utterances of that exalted lady, the
mother of the Báb, were along these lines:

> From the moment of birth, it was evident that, unlike other children, He
> was not rapacious in drinking milk. Normally, He was serene and made
> no noise. During the twenty-four-hour period, He would desire milk only
> four times. While nursing he would be most gentle, and no movement was
> discerned from His mouth. Often I would become anxious and ask myself,
> “Why is this Child not like other children? Perhaps He has some illness
> that prevents His desiring milk.” Then I would console myself, saying, “If
> He really had some unknown illness, He would manifest signs of agitation
and restlessness.”

Unlike other children, He did not complain or behave in an unseemly
> manner during the weaning period. I was most thankful that now that
> the Exalted Lord had granted me this one Child, He was gentle and
> agreeable.

> Moreover, according to what trustworthy persons have reported, it was
> evident from the beginning of His childhood that He had an extraordinary
> character that excited the wonder and amazement of all, whether relatives,
[p.5] friends, or strangers, for He was unlike any other child.

Schooling

> According to Mullá Fathuʾlláh Maktab-Dár [the school-master], son of
> Mullá Mand-ʿAlí, when His blessed age had reached ﬁve years old,20

He was taken to the [quranic school of ] Shaykh ʿAbid,21 known as Shaykh

The Báb provides the date of His birth in the Sahiﬁh Baynuʾl-Haramayn: “Say O
> denizens of the Concourse! Hear the command of the Remnant of God from this Servant,
> the Exalted, the Wise. And this Servant was born, as hath been concealed in the Book of
> God, on the ﬁrst day of Muharram of the year twelve hundred and thirty-ﬁve.” Also, the
> same date can be computed precisely from His age given in His personal diary appended
> to the Azali publication of the Kitáb Panj Shaʾn (the Book of Five Modes). Other references
> to His age are to be found in the Persian Bayán 2:1 and 4:11, and the Dalaʾil Sabʿa (the
Seven Proofs).

In Persian, when someone’s age is reported as, say, ﬁve years of age, it means they
> are in their ﬁfth year of life. In English, during the whole of the ﬁfth year of life, a child
> is said to be four years old. In general, whenever age is given in Baháʾí histories translated
> from the Persian, it is necessary to subtract one to get the age in the English manner of
> reckoning. However, in the present translation, everywhere an age is provided, the original
Persian reckoning is given.

His given name was Shaykh Muhammad (d. AH 1263/AD 1847), and he is also
known as Shaykh Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín or Shaykh Muʿallim. The Báb mentioned him in the

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 4                                                                                          7/10/2008 3:45:04 PM

> Anám,22 located in Qahviyih Awlíyá,23 one of the mystic convents occupied
> by the mystics of Fárs, on the Tayr marketplace,24 near the house of His
> maternal grandfather, and His respected maternal uncle. Mullá Fathuʾlláh
> Maktab-Dár, son of Mullá Mand-ʿAlí, was the custodian of the Masjid
> Vakíl.25 Like his father, he was one of the early believers [in the Báb] and,
> because of the persecutions and harassment, became a fugitive and forced
to travel extensively.26 He related:

> When they brought His Holiness to the maktab [quranic school], I worked
> for Shaykh Anám in the Qahviyih Awlíyá, which is one of the mystic
> convents in the old neighborhood of Shíráz,27 where the school had several
> rooms with a circular portico around them. The honored Shaykh ʿAbid, a
> man of many qualities, was the schoolmaster and taught the children of
> the noblemen, the aﬄuent, the merchants, and other distinguished citizens.
> He was a tall, ever-digniﬁed man with a long beard. A follower of the late
> Shaykh Ahmad Ahsáʾí and Siyyid Kázim Rashtí, he ranked among the
leading ﬁgures and divines of Shíráz.

At that time, I served the Shaykh as the khaliﬁh (that is, the [school’s]
> principal). Those wishing for their youngster to receive tuition from him,
> had to come beforehand and meet with him in person. They would ask
> the Shaykh for a place either through a letter or through a distinguished
> intermediary. This was because the Shaykh did not accept the children of
> just anyone and was particularly reluctant to accept lads from the bazaarí
> shopkeepers, because of their ill manners and dirty clothing.

> Arabic Bayán 6:11, “Say: O Muhammad, My teacher! Do not beat Me ere My years have
gone beyond ﬁve.”

A variation of the same name, Shaykhuná, is employed in Nabíl Aʿzam, The Dawn-
Breakers, p. 75.

Named after a certain Suﬁ saint, Dervish Awlíyá (d. AH 1119/AD 1707), this convent
> is occupied by the dervishes and Suﬁs. Located in the Bazaar Murgh, it is situated near the
> house of the Báb’s maternal uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, and over the years it has decayed
so thoroughly that no trace of it is now evident.

Known also as the Bazaar Murgh [poultry market] quarter, this is one of the most
> prosperous and religiously signiﬁcant quarters of the city and one of the ﬁve Haydarí wards
of Shíráz. For further details, see Fasáʾí, Fársnámih Násirí, vol. 2, pp. 27–47.

Masjid Vakíl was the largest and most important of Shíráz’s mosques.

Mullá Fathuʾlláh and his father converted on the day the Báb proclaimed His Call in
> the aforementioned mosque. Both were among the martyrs at Shaykh Tabarsí, and therefore
his recollection of the Báb must have been conveyed to the Afnán family at an early time.

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh adds parenthetically, “And the center of this convent was inhabited,
surrounded by ruins and evidence of old graves and gravestones.”

Description of His Condition During Childhood

> In any event, one morning, I saw the honored Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-
> Ridá,28 who had been a friend of Shaykh Anám in the past, come to the
> Qahviyih [Awlíyá]. He sat next to the Shaykh and described his situation
as follows:

> “After forty years, the Exalted Lord has graced me with a Child who has
> caused me to wonder over His behavior.” The Shaykh asked him to explain
> further, but he only replied, “It is hard to say.” [The Shaykh] insisted, to
which [the father] oﬀered:

O venerable Shaykh! Which of His amazing conditions should I recount?

> Such peculiar characteristics are manifest in Him that the people are aston-
> ished. Now, when He is ﬁve years old, He sometimes raises His hands to
> the threshold of the One God, and recites prayers. He wakes in the middle
> of the night29 and stands to oﬀer His obligatory prayers, in the midst of
> which He weeps. Sometimes He is sad, on other occasions He is happy,
> or immersed in rapture, or preoccupied with the imaginary world. My
> astonishment and bewilderment prevents me from describing further. Were
> I to recount all that I have observed from the time of His birth until the
present, it would make a thick book.

At such a [young] age, He tells whether an unborn child is a boy or a
girl, for the whole clan. After the birth, it is as He foretold.

And again, some time ago, together with His maternal uncle, the esteemed
> Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, we were at the bathhouse of Bazaar Murgh quarter.30
> This Child was sleeping between His uncle and me, when suddenly He
> rose and stated, ‘The vaulted roof of the Garm-Khánih [steam chamber]
> of Mírzá Hádí’s bathhouse, which was for women, has just caved in, and
> ﬁve women and one child have been [killed] under the rubble.’ His uncle
> said to Him, ʿÁqá, please sleep and refrain from saying such things. What
> manner of talk is this!’ He responded, ‘It is as I said.’ It was not long after
> that we heard a tumult of voice from the direction of the bathhouse, saying
> that Mírzá Hádí’s bathhouse was wrecked and a number of women were
> under the rubble. One person said twenty women [were killed]; another
> said thirty or forty; but later it was determined that ﬁve women and a child
> had been killed. The truth was just as He had said.

A.Q. Afnán has said that on that occasion, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, the Báb’s maternal
uncle, went to the school (private communication, August 1993).

This suggests that the Báb woke before dawn to oﬀer His ﬁrst morning prayer
> and, unlike most others, was not combining the ﬁrst and the second Muslim obligatory
prayer.

A.Q. Afnán suggests that only the Báb and His maternal uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí,
were present on that occasion (private communication, August 1993).

In another instance, a while ago He informed us, ‘Last night, I dreamt
> that a large balance was suspended in mid-air in a vast space. Imám Jaʿfar [p.10]
> Sádiq was seated on one of the plates, and, because of His weight, that
> plate was resting on the ground while the other plate was suspended in the
> air. An invisible person lifted Me and placed Me on the empty plate. My
> plate was now heavier than the other, and I came to the ground and the
> ﬁrst dish rose into the air.’ I said to Him, ‘Alas, Child, how bizarre! Do
not talk like that.’

What should I say! There are so many astonishing stories about Him that
> I cannot tell. At one time, Áqá Mírzá Siyyid Hasan31 suggested that this
> Child might be under the spell of jinn or fairies, and he said that we should
> take Him to those knowledgeable in such matters and request protective
> prayers for Him. Even though I do not believe that such things are true
> and trustworthy, in the light of his [Siyyid Hasan’s] comment I brought Áqá
> Muhammad-Hasan, the Munajjim [astrologer], to the house and described
> for him the details. He made some calculations and said, ‘He is protected
> from the malevolence of jinn and fairies, and he has not suﬀered any harm
> from sprites.’ Then he asked for His birthdate. Thereupon, he wrote certain
> protective charms and prayers and gave them [to us], recited some mysteri-
> ous verses and, having learned of His birthdate, he left. After the departure
> of Áqá Muhammad-Hasan, the Child tore up the talismans, the writings he
> had left, and the sheet of instructions he had given [us], and tossed them
> out, saying to me, ‘In the words of the mystic: You make a great show of
assistance, but I am that assistance.’32

In short, for some time I have been consumed with the diﬃculties of
> this Child, and I do not know which of His conditions I should describe
> to you. It is now time for His education and training, and I wish Him to
receive His tuition and religious training from you.

I was most astounded by the descriptions of the venerable Mírzá [Muham-
> mad-Ridá], and the Shaykh was astonished as well. It was decided that at
> an agreeable time on [the following] Thursday morning the Child would
be brought to the school.

On the promised morning, the Child arrived followed by a servant33

> carrying a small [copper-tray] ﬁlled with sweets and a student’s version
> of the Qurʾán, which is customary for the new pupil to read from in the
schools in Shíráz.

Because of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Ridá’s descriptions of Him, the Shaykh,
> several of the students who had reached the age of maturity, and I were
> thoroughly enthralled in watching Him. He came in, greeted [everyone],

The Afnán Kabír of later years, brother-in-law of the Báb.

An alternative reading of this poem is, You bring forth a prayer, and I am that
Prayer.

In the original, ghulám implies a slave or indentured servant.

trusted, and respected merchant, related:

> I was twelve years old at that time, and on that day Siyyid-i Báb came and

> “Why are You not reading the lesson [aloud] like the other children?” He
[p.15]            made no reply; however, two other lads sitting near us were heard reading
poems from Háﬁz aloud, and they came to this verse:
From Heaven’s heights the birdsong calls to you

in sorrow that you’re trapped in walls of clay.
He turned quickly to me and said, “That is your answer.” I replied,
“Well done.”36
Similarly, it is related:

> Since Shaykh Anám was a learned man and a follower of Shaykh Ahmad
> [Ahsáʾí], each morning he conducted a seminary session in Qahviyih Awlíyá
> where several of his [theological] students would gather to engage him in
> discussions and debates. One day a scientiﬁc topic was being discussed, and
> after considerable debate it remained unresolved, since it was particularly
> complex. The venerable Shaykh stated, “Tonight I will study the [authorita-
> tive] books on this topic, and tomorrow we will discuss the matter again
> and solve it completely.” At this point, the exchange was concluded.

Qurʾán 34:25.

Nabíl Aʿzam, The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 75–76, tells a similar story, though consider-
ably diﬀerent in details.

the childhood and early life of the báb                            9

Suddenly the young Pupil [who had been listening] raised His blessed
> head and with sound reasoning, irrefutable proof, and scientiﬁc evidence,
> propounded the answer they sought and removed all complexities. They
> were wonder-struck and amazed. The [seminarian] students informed the
> Shaykh that they had no recollection of ever having discussed that topic
> so that this Child could have memorized it like a parrot and now repeat it
> for them. They expressed their bewilderment, and the Shaykh responded
> that he too was ﬁlled with awe. Full of amazement, he asked Him where
> He had gained this knowledge. The Pupil smiled and oﬀered this couplet
from Háﬁz:
Should the Holy Spirit’s grace again assist,

Others too will do what Christ has done.37

> In all events, during those tender years, many such manifestations of
> extraordinary and innate qualities were observed in Him and are testiﬁed
to by both friends and foes, and are beyond my abilities to describe.38

His father, Áqá Mír[zá] Muhammad-Ridá, passed away when the Báb
> was only nine years old,39 and from then on He was reared in the bosom
> of His maternal uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí. This uncle had witnessed
> such remarkable and astonishing feats by Him with his own eyes, that
> when He declared His Cause, without requiring any proof or evidence,
> Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí readily and unhesitatingly accepted His claim and
> became a believer. He sacriﬁced his life and possessions in the path of
> the Beloved of the world.

The Testimony of the Khál Aʿzam

> My paternal grandmother, [Zahrá Bagum], who was a paternal cousin of
> the Báb’s mother, related that she had personally heard the uncle [Hájí
> Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí] discussing [the claim of the Báb] with his younger
> brother, Hájí Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí, and the latter was resisting the argument

See Balyúzí, The Báb, p. 35. For similar childhood stories of the Báb, see Nabíl
Aʿzam, The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 75–76.

The Báb in the Qayyúmuʾl-Asmáʾ, Surih al-Sina, verse 5, addressing Himself states,
> “And We favored Thee during Thy Childhood with the mighty Cause of God, as it had
> been decreed as such in the Mother Book.” In the same Book, Surih al-Ism, verse 34,
> the Báb proclaims, “Verily, as a child I was aware of the truth of My own Self, and God
is the Almighty, the All-knowing.”

In the Qayyúmuʾl-Asmáʾ, Surih al-Jihad, verse 39, the Báb states, “O My God, My
> Lord! Verily, in accordance with Thy will, My father passed away, and I do not remember
> Him. My Master, when he is seated with the heavenly angels, inform him of My Cause
> and record him in this Mighty Book.”

> conﬁdence about him since His adulthood, there is no room for doubt
for anyone, especially for me.”
He then continued:

> Have you forgotten our journey to Sabz-Púshán40 when He was a child aged
> nine years old? There was a group of us, and He came along as well. When
> we arrived, being completely exhausted, we performed our ablutions, oﬀered
[p.20]         our late afternoon and the evening obligatory prayers, paid our homage of

> visitation, ate dinner, and went to bed. It was not long after, at midnight,
> that I awoke and noticed that He was not in bed. Deeply perturbed, I was
> overtaken with anxiety that perhaps He had fallen from the mountain.
> Finally, after searching extensively, I heard a voice raised in the obligatory
> prayer and prayers of gloriﬁcation to the Lord, coming from the lower
> extremities [of the mountain]. When I followed the melody of that chant,
> I found the Child, standing alone and in private, in consummate rapture
> voicing prayers and supplications to the One Who transcends all mention,
> on the deserted mountainside and at that late hour of the night. My beloved
> brother, I ask: After observing such things, is there any room for doubt?
> With a knowledge born of certainty, with truth that stands most manifest,

> hundred and sixty years. The proof has been completed. Whosoever denies

In short, our grandmother often spoke to us on this theme.

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh added parenthetically, “Located in the mountains south of Shíráz,
> the shrine of Sabz-Púshán is about twelve kilometers from the city. The route to that place
> is most diﬃcult, and even strong individuals are exhausted by the journey. People often visit
> that spot in the summer.”

CHAPTER TWO

COMMERCE AND MARRIAGE

Commerce

> When the Báb had reached the age of ﬁfteen, He joined the commercial [p.21:4]
> oﬃce of His uncle, [Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí], in Shíráz.41 He remained
> for a short while in Shíráz and then moved to the port city of Búshihr.
> In that city, His oﬃce was in the Mínandí caravansary. Although it was
> before the declaration of His Cause, the many signs and e vidences of
> His sanctity and the wondrous verses that ﬂowed from His blessed pen
would attract the envy and the jealousy of men of learning.42

One day in Egypt during the time when the illustrious Abúʾl-Fadl was
> occupied with writing the Kitáb-i Faráʾíd, we came to talk about the early
> years of the Báb prior to His declaration and the period when He was
engaged in trading. Mírzá Abúʾl-Fadl related the following to me:
I myself heard Hájí Siyyid Javád known as Karbaláʾí relate that

> when His Holiness [the Báb] was active as a merchant in Búshihr, because
> of my friendship and close association with His maternal uncles, I used
> to stay with them whenever I visited either Shíráz or Búshihr. One day
> Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad, a maternal uncle [of the Báb], came to
> me with a request, “Give some good counsel to my Nephew. Tell Him
> not to write or speak about certain studies that can only provoke the
> jealousy of certain people. These people cannot tolerate seeing a young
> merchant of little schooling demonstrate such scientiﬁc erudition and
> therefore become envious and resentful.” He was very insistent that I
> should counsel Him [to desist from such activities], but in the end I
> replied with this verse:

A.Q. Afnán suggests that based on extensive family correspondence examined by
> him, the Báb began to work in His uncle’s oﬃce at the age of ten, and it was at the age
> of ﬁfteen—the age of maturity in Islamic law—that He moved to Búshihr (private com-
> munications, August 1992). The same information is provided by the Báb Himself in the
> Kitáb Fihrist, “After My childhood had passed, by the will of God, I began the occupation
of commerce as this was decreed by God, and I commenced this from the age of ten.”

Nicolas, Seyyed Ali Mohammad dit le Bab, p. 189, n. 131, on the authority of Hájí
> Mírzá Jání of Kashan, whom Nicolas assumed to be the author of the Kitáb-i Nuqtatuʾl-
> Kaf, suggests that at the age of eighteen the Báb revealed Risálih Fiqihiyyih.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 11                                                                                  7/10/2008 3:45:05 PM

12                                    chapter two

> The luster of the fair of face cannot be veiled,
> Shut him in and out of eyelet will he show his visage.

> and added: “We are earthbound and He is celestial. Our counsel is no
> use to Him.”43

> In Búshihr He engaged in commerce for six years44 and associated with
> all strata of society, including the ʿulamá, the merchants, and the shop-
> keepers, and dealt with all in such wise that they were very satisﬁed and
> grateful in every respect. In every gathering and assembly, men praised
His splendid qualities.

During one of my journeys to the sacred presence of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá,
> He spoke one day about the time the Báb stayed [in Búshihr] and of his
commercial activities. He stated:

> During His stay in Búshihr, the Báb achieved extraordinary things and
> thoroughly demolished the foundation of people’s corrupt practices. The
> merchants of Búshihr had a custom that after a deal had been concluded
> they would renege and barter to receive a considerable discount. Some of
> them came to His Holiness, negotiated purchase of indigo dye, and bought
> a very large quantity. After they had sealed the bargain and moved the lots
> of indigo to their own oﬃce, they returned to renege and bargain. His
[p.25]             Holiness did not accept and said, “You made a bargain, signed papers, and

> the transaction has been completed. I will not give a discount and will not
> renegotiate.” They insisted. He replied, “What I said is ﬁnal.” They pleaded,
> “It is the custom of the country.” He responded, “Many of these customs
> are wrong and will soon be abolished.” No matter how much they insisted,
> He would not agree. The merchants were obstinate, and at last He said,
> “[If ] the price is high, return the merchandise as I will not barter.” They
> insisted, “It is the custom here.” He replied, “I wish to put an end to this
> custom.” They insisted, “If a merchant has bought commodities and moved
> them to his warehouse, and then returns them, he will forfeit his standing
> with merchants.” “It is your choice,” He told them, “accept the terms and
> refrain from re-negotiation.” Again they insisted, “But this is the custom of
> the realm.” Yet again, He reminded them, “I am ending this custom.”
ʿAbduʾl-Bahá continued relating:

> Eventually, He [the Báb] ordered the merchandise brought back to His shop
> and did not yield to their eﬀorts at bargaining. He changed many of their
> unseemly practices during the period He was a merchant in Búshihr.

> A similar translation appears in Balyúzí, The Báb, pp. 39–40.

The Báb indicates He was in Búshihr for ﬁve years; see Selections from the Writings of
the Báb, pp. 180–81.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 12                                                                                      7/10/2008 3:45:05 PM

commerce and marriage                                     13

Soon thereafter, one of His maternal uncles arrived at Búshihr, and the
> same merchants who had returned the indigo dye came to see the uncle and
> complained about His behavior, saying, “He has ruined our reputation. We
> had a deal on dyes, however, as customary, we wished to renegotiate, but
> He did not comply. He arranged for the goods to be brought back from
> our store. This is a great insult to us as merchants. You should counsel Him
not to repeat such oﬀenses.”

The maternal uncle approached the Báb advising Him, “Why do You
> refuse to yield to people’s wishes and disrupt the established customs of
> the realm?” He told him, “Even now, if they should wish to bargain after
> a transaction is completed, I would refuse again.”
> That was a very blissful day. ʿAbduʾl-Bahá smiled unceasingly and repeated
> several times, “Prior to His declaration, the Báb announced that He would
change many of the accepted ways.”

In short, after six years’ residence in Búshihr, [the Báb] wrote several
> times to His uncles, “I plan to visit the ʿAtabát.45 One of you should come
> to Búshihr and take over the business so I can commence my journey
> to the ʿAtabát.” The uncles procrastinated and did not comply with His
> wish. When the time for His departure arrived, He settled His accounts
> with everyone, prepared a detailed ledger, sealed the books, and left them
> in the oﬃce. He then sealed the entrance to the oﬃce and entrusted the
> key to the custodian of that building with the instructions that whichever
> of His maternal uncles should arrive ﬁrst from Shíráz to Búshihr should
> be allowed to enter. Thereupon, He wrote to Shíráz “Though I wrote you
> repeatedly asking that one of you come to Búshihr as I have a journey to
> the ʿAtabát in mind, you have not come. Therefore, I have sealed the door
> of the shop and entrusted the key to the custodian and have left for the
ʿAtabát.”46 So, after six years in Búshihr, He left for the ʿAtabát.

Once His blessed letter was received in Shíráz, [His eldest maternal
> uncle,] Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad became deeply worried and per-
> turbed, complaining, “What manner of conduct is this? Our good name in
> the commercial community will be ruined, and the chain of our business
> transactions will be broken! What will happen to our accounts with the
> people?” To this, the illustrious uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, responded,

The ʿAtabát is a general term referring to the region where Najaf, Karbalá, Kázimayn,
> and Sámarrá are located. The ﬁrst of the two cities hold within them the Shrines of Imám
> ʿAlí and Imám Husayn, respectively. Kázimayn is famous because the Shrines of the seventh
> and the ninth Imáms are located there. Sámarrá is where the Shrines of the tenth and the
eleventh Imáms, ʿAlí an-Naqi and Hasan al-ʿAskarí, are situated.

Mírzá Abúʾl-Fadl, Táríkh Zuhúr Díyánt Hadrat Báb va Hadrat Baháʾuʾlláh, gives the
date of Báb’s departure as 1 Rabíʿuʾl-Avval AH 1257 [23 April 1841].

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 13                                                                                    7/10/2008 3:45:05 PM

14                                   chapter two

> “Rest assured! I know Him, and our Nephew does not do anything wrong.
[I am certain that] He has arranged people’s accounts before leaving.”

The uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad, set out for Búshihr.47 Upon
> his arrival, he secured the key from the custodian of the caravansary,
> noted the seal on the door of the room, opened the door, and began a
> careful examination of the books. He found that the accounts relating to
> every person were most satisfactory and accurate. Relieved, he wrote to
[p.30] his brothers, “the accounts and record books are in order” and expressed

praise and gratitude for their Nephew.48

In the ʿAtabát

> The Báb arrived at the ʿAtabát. His blessed stay in the ʿAtabát is an exten-
> sive story, but it will be related here brieﬂy, as our attention is focused
on events in Fárs.

One day Mullá Husayn, who at that time was engaged in studies in
> the ʿAtabát under the tutelage of Siyyid [Kázim Rashtí], saw His Holiness
> [the Báb] while He was standing in prayer at the sanctuary of the Shrine
> of the Prince of Martyrs.49 He saw a young Siyyid, aged twenty-two,
> oﬀering His supplications with an intense humility and rapture that was
> not to be observed previously among any of the ʿulamá, the mystics, or
> the pilgrims [to that sacred Shrine]. He was carried away with petitioning
> God and performing the rites of pilgrimage. Mullá Husayn was astounded
> and attracted by his beauty and perfection. He approached [the Báb] and
> greeted Him. However, wrapped in devotions, His Holiness did not reply.
> Mullá Husayn moved to the back and waited there. Having completed
> the pilgrimage prayers in the inner sanctuary, [the Báb] went out to the
> courtyard, and to Mullá Husayn’s utter astonishment, repeated the pil-
grimage prayers there.

Once more, Mullá Husayn approached and greeted Him. Being occu-
> pied with His prayers, [the Báb] did not respond, which further deepened
> the Akhúnd’s wonder.50

> A.Q. Afnán suggests that it was the younger uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, who went

on Búshihr. (Private communications, Nov. 1992).

For a brief description of the Báb’s stay in Búshihr, see Nabíl Aʿzam, The Dawn-
Breakers, pp. 77–80.

A reference to Imám Husayn.

Mullá Husayn is referred to as ʿAkhúnd’, meaning a lower-level divine who serves the
people, somewhat analogous to a parish priest or a teacher of divinity at a school. The term

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 14                                                                                       7/10/2008 3:45:06 PM

commerce and marriage                                       15

When [the Báb] had completed the pilgrimage prayers, He moved
> outside from the courtyard. The Akhúnd [Mullá Husayn] approached
> Him and greeted Him. This time, [the Báb] returned his greeting and
> apologized, “Twice you have showed your courtesy, but absorbed and
> transported in the rites of pilgrimage, concentrating only on the exalted
> Shrine of the Imám—upon Him be peace—I did not respond. For this,
> I wish to apologize. Whosoever attains that sacred ground must forget
> himself and all worldly matters. As such, I had become oblivious of My
> own Self and overcome with other conditions. Once more, I apologize
to you.”51

Hearing such a speech only served to enhance the amazement of the
> Akhúnd, as he had never thought that a young merchant could manifest
> such extraordinary depth of humility, reverence, piety, and veneration. It
> was unusual and contrary to the fashionable neglect of religion. Therefore,
> he extensively expressed the depth of his gratitude and thanks, and asked,
> “Master, where is Your home, for I wish to make the customary courtesy
> call?” [The Báb] told him how to ﬁnd the house. [Mullá Husayn] then
> said, “Siyyid [Kázim Rashtí] holds a service of prayers and admonition
> at his own home every Friday morning. Should You decide to attend, it
> would greatly honor the assembly, and we would be profoundly grate-
> ful.” [The Báb] responded, “There is no harm in that,” and promised to
attend the session.

The Akhúnd reported with great care the details of what had transpired
to Siyyid [Kázim] who had smiled and recited this verse:
That which my heart had understood in dreams

was hidden behind this veil, and is now found.

> During the last two or three years, Hájí Siyyid Kázim Rashtí devoted his
> sermons and lectures solely to the manifestation of the Promised Proof. He
> repeatedly expounded on the signs of His appearance and the characteristics
> of the Lord of Command. Many a time he would tell [his students that
> the promised Qáʾim] must be young, not instructed by anyone else, and
> must be a scion of the Baní-Háshim.52

> has become pejorative in modern times but has been retained in several places in the present
> translation in the interest of authenticity. In a few places though it has been replaced with
‘Mullá Husayn’ to clarify the meaning.

16                                 chapter two

On the morning of the appointed Friday, [the Báb] made his promised
> visit to the home of the Siyyid where the latter was occupied with preach-
> ing from the pulpit and the house was ﬁlled to capacity with worshippers.
> Finding no seat available, His Holiness [the Báb] sat at the threshold.
> On seeing His countenance, the late Siyyid said no more, preferring pure
> silence. All those present were astonished. After a quarter of an hour, he
> resumed an oration regarding the signs of the manifestation of the Prom-
[p.35] ised One. He said, “Behold, He is manifest as the sun”. With these words

> he concluded his arguments and descended the pulpit.53 It was at this
> moment that with the utmost reverence Akhúnd Mullá Husayn approached
His Holiness [the Báb] and led Him to a seat next to the Siyyid.

Were I to detail the sojourn of the Báb in the ʿAtabát and the events
> that transpired there and the glad tidings imparted by the late Siyyid, it
> would be like a Qurʾán commentary or a thick book of history. But our
> purpose is to outline the events in Fárs.

Return from the ʿAtabát

> After six months of His blessed stay in the ʿAtabát had passed, His mother,
> longing to see her only Oﬀspring, earnestly petitioned her brother, Hájí
> Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, to proceed for the ʿAtabát and to bring His Holiness
> to Shíráz—a matter that she greatly insisted upon. Deeply devoted to his
> sister and Nephew, the illustrious uncle agreed and proceeded at once to
the ʿAtabát.

On meeting His Holiness, he stated, “I have come to accompany you
> in Your return to Shíráz.” [The Báb] refused. However much the uncle
> insisted, He refused, stating, “I intend to remain in the ʿAtabát for some
time.”

Because his sister was looking forward to His Holiness’s arrival in Shíráz,
> the uncle did not defer to this refusal. Through a message transmitted by
> Hájí Siyyid Javád Karbaláʾí, he appealed to the Siyyid [Kázim] to convince
His Holiness to return to Shíráz.

One day, the uncle himself went to the home of the Siyyid [Kázim] and
> explained the situation as follows: “My Nephew lived in Búshihr for six
> years before coming to the ʿAtabát. His mother has no other child beside
> Him and deeply longs to see Him and plans to arrange for His marriage.

See Nabíl Aʿzam, The Dawn-Breakers, p. 27, where Nabíl outlines slightly diﬀerent
recollections of that day from Shaykh Hasan Zunúzí.

> He has not consented to what I say, in bidding Him return to Shíráz.
> Therefore, I beg of you to speak with Him, that He may accompany me
> to Shíráz.” At ﬁrst, the Siyyid replied, “Is it up to us to interfere? Allow
> us the beneﬁt of His presence for a while longer.” The illustrious uncle
> responded, “As His mother is anticipating His arrival and her approval is
important as well, kindly tell Him to agree to return to Shíráz.”

Eventually, the Siyyid transmitted the message to His Holiness [the
> Báb], saying, “If it pleases You, return to Shíráz.” Because it was the wish
> of the Siyyid, His Holiness agreed. In the company of His uncle, He set
> out for Shíráz.54

Marriage

The following is noted in Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, pp. 132–33, on the authority of
Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúruʾl-Haqq, volume 3:

> Because of the insistence of the mother of the Báb and other kinsmen as well as his
> own profound desire, Hájí Mír[zá] Siyyid ʿAlí, the Khál, had come to Karbalá. One
> day the Báb met Mullá Sádiq [Khurásání] in the courtyard of the Shrine of Imám
> Husayn. The Báb said to him, “My uncle has recently arrived from Shíráz, and if you
> wish to meet him, come to our abode.” The Akhúnd expressed his deep interest and
> with thanks assured Him he would come. That very afternoon he went to the home
> of the Báb where a great many of the ʿulamá, merchants, and other dignitaries were
> present, with the Khál sitting and conversing with the guests, and the Báb serving
> tea and sherbet. Mullá Sádiq spoke of the Báb’s peerless qualities and His exalted
> character. In response, the Khál said, “Even though our entire family is well known
> in Shíráz and its vicinity for our pious nature and goodly characters, yet this Youth
> shines like a most brilliant candle in our midst, and it is most evident that He is
> cut from a diﬀerent cloth. Our one wish is for Him to undertake study of divers

> engaged in studying.” Thrilled at the prospect, the Khál stated, “Even though it is
> very agonizing for His mother and other kinsmen to be far from Him, yet because of
> your assurance, I will return by myself to Shíráz.” A few days later, the Khál returned
> to his native city and left the Báb in Karbalá. However, it was not long thereafter

Ahmad, the Báb’s Son

> After a year, that is in AH 1259 [1843], God granted Him a son who
> died at birth. Before his birth, [the Báb] had prophesied, “The child is a
> boy named Ahmad, but it is not his destiny to live.” The child was buried
> in the Bíbí Dukhtarán cemetery of Shíráz.57 My paternal grandmother,
> [Zahrá Bagum], who was the sister of Khadíjih Bagum, related for me
> the details surrounding the child’s birth:
[p.40]        The delivery of the child was very diﬃcult, to the point that several times

> we lost all hope for the mother’s recovery. During the ﬁnal surge of the
> labor pains, the mother of His Holiness went to Him. He asked her, “Has
> she delivered?” to which she responded negatively. [The Báb] then took a
> small mirror that lay by His side, penned a prayer and a talisman on the
> face of the mirror, gave it to His mother, [saying that she should] take it
> to His wife and hold it before her face. She took the mirror and held it
> before [Khadíjih Bagum]. As her gaze fell upon the mirror, instantly the
> lifeless child was delivered, and the mother recovered.58

As customary on such occasions, the wedding consisted of two separate celebrations,
> one for the men and the other for the women. The men gathered in the house of the
> Báb’s uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, while the women gathered in the residence of Khadíjih
> Bagum’s father, which house was next door. The wedding was conducted by Shaykh Abú-
Turáb, the Imám-Jumʿih (A.Q. Afnán, private communications, August 1992).

A copy of the Báb’s marriage certiﬁcate provides the same date, see Balyúzí, The
> Báb page opposite 80, and Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, pp. 158–61. The Báb refers to His
> wedding as follows: “O concourse of Light! Hear My call from the point of Fire in this
> ocean of snow-white water on this crimson earth. Verily, I am God, besides Whom there
> is no other God. On the exalted throne a beloved noble woman, bearing the same name
> [Khadíjih] as the beloved of the First Friend [the Prophet Muhammad], was wedded to
> this Great Remembrance; and verily, I caused the angels of Heaven and the denizens of
> Paradise, on the day of the Covenant, to bear witness, in truth, to God’s Remembrance”
> (The Báb, Qayyúmuʾl-Asmaʾ, Surih of Qarábat [The Chapter of Kinship], quoted in Fayzí,
Khándán Afnán, pp. 7–8).

Thus named since the tomb of Bíbí Dukhtarán is located there. For further details,
consult Fasaʾi, Fársnámih Násirí, vol. 2, p. 1131.

The following passage from The Báb, Qayyúmuʾl-Asmáʾ, Surih Qarábih, is addressed to
Khadíjih Bagum (cited in Balyúzí, Khadíjih Bagum, pp. 8–9, edited slightly below): “O well-

The Báb’s mother then returned to His presence and remonstrated with

> You not perform this act sooner and preserve the life of the child?” He
> smiled and replied, “It is not My destiny to leave any progeny.” His mother

The wife of the Báb recounted for me:

> One night I dreamt that there was a fearsome male lion in the courtyard.
> My hands were around the neck of the lion. The beast dragged me around
> the courtyard two and a half times. I woke up, profoundly alarmed and
> trembling with fright. His Holiness asked me the cause of my agitation, and
> I told him what I had dreamt. His comment was: “You awoke too soon, as

> and-a-half years.” And what He said, transpired.

> beloved! Prize thou highly the grace of the Great Remembrance for it cometh from God, the

> Ancient of Days, and take pride in being the consort of the Well-Beloved, Who is loved by
> God, the Most Great. Suﬃcient unto thee is this glory, which cometh unto thee from God,
> the All-Wise, the All-Praised. Be patient in all that God hath ordained concerning the Báb

> the Sublime, in the sanctiﬁed Paradise.” Also, see Balyúzí, Khadíjih Bagum, p. 9, for another
mention by the Báb of his son Ahmad, in Suratuʾl-ʿAbd of the Qayyúmuʾl-Asmáʾ.

See Nabíl Aʿzam, The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 76–77, for a brief reference to this incident
and a purported prayer by the Báb marking the passing of His son.

CHAPTER THREE

THE BURNING BUSH

[p.41:10] It proceeded thus until ﬁnally the declaration of the Báb took place on the

> eve of Friday, the ﬁfth day of Jamádíyuʾl-Avval AH 1260 [23 May 1844],
> two hours and eleven minutes into the night.60 There is a magniﬁcent story
of these wonderful events related by the wife of the Báb as follows:

> The practice of His Holiness was that each day He would return home
> about an hour after the sunset and commence devotions, the chanting of
> the names of God, and writing. About three hours into the night He would
> have the evening meal and would retire about four hours past sunset. In
> the morning, He would rise one hour before the dawn and, after washing,
> would perform His ablutions and then proceed to the upper chambers of
> the House, which had been set aside as His formal guestroom and formed
> an outer apartment. There, He stood to recite tablets of visitation, prayers,
> supplications, and to repeat the names of God. When the sun had risen,
> Fiddih61 would ﬁre up the samovar and prepare the tea in the chamber
> occupied by His mother. His Holiness would come down to that apartment
> and have the morning tea. After that, He would proceed to His merchant
oﬃce to engage in His own business.

However, one night, unlike other nights, He came home at dusk, saying,
> “Tell Fiddih to prepare whatever we are having for the evening meal sooner
> than usual. Tonight I have a particular task to attend to.” About an hour
> and a half into the night, the dinner was served, and He joined us for this
> purpose. Afterwards, Fiddih brought water for Him to wash His blessed
> hands, and, as usual in the evenings, she spread our bedding and retired to
her own quarters. His Holiness retired for the night.

It was not long after that I saw Him rise from the bed and leave the room,
> going to the outer courtyard. At ﬁrst, I thought He had gone to the lavatory.
> When considerable time had passed and He did not return, I was seized by
> apprehension. I rose from my bed and left the apartment. I looked in the
> lavatory but did not see Him. Checking the street door, I found it locked
> from within. I looked in the chamber of His mother and did not ﬁnd Him
> there either. By then I was deeply bewildered and perplexed. I walked to the
> western part of the house and looked up towards the upper chamber, situated
> on the eastern wing of the House and serving as His private quarters, and

> The exact time and date of the Báb’s declaration is given in the Persian Bayán 2:7.

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh adds parenthetically: Fiddih and Mubárak were two Black servants
purchased in Búshihr during His days of commerce.

> saw that it was well lighted. It seemed as if a thousand lamps illumined the
> room. This added to my surprise, because there were no guests to require
> so many lamps. Therefore, full of astonishment, I went up the steps to the
> room. When I entered, I found that the room was so brilliantly lit that it
dazzled my eyes, although there was only a single lamp.

I saw His Holiness standing, facing the Qiblih; His hands raised heaven- [p.45]
> wards, intoning a prayer. As soon as my gaze fell upon His blessed Being, I
> beheld such majesty and resplendence as is beyond my powers to explain.
> Suddenly, such awe and trepidation enveloped me that I stood transﬁxed
> where I was, trembling uncontrollably like a leaf. I could neither retrace my
> steps nor stand. I was close to losing consciousness. All kinds of perplexities
> enveloped me. Suddenly He made a gesture with His blessed hand, telling
> me to go back. This movement of His sanctiﬁed hands released me from that
> state, and I returned to the apartment and bed. But I could not sleep, and I
> remained deeply disturbed. Every detail of the image of His blessed Person
> and that scene [in the upper chamber] added to my consternation. I felt
> like a wrongdoer who has fallen short and awaits the all-powerful sovereign
> to pass sentence on her. I did not sleep that night, until the muʾadhdhin’s62
call to morning prayers sounded from the mosque adjacent to the house.

After the adhán [call to prayer] He came downstairs. As soon as my eyes
> alighted on His blessed Countenance, I was seized by awe and perplexity.
> He no longer seemed like the Person with whom I had lived for two and
> a half years. I did not have the courage to utter a word. In any case, the
> sun was rising and I rose, carried out my ablutions, and performed the
obligatory prayer.

In accordance with our daily routine, our servant, Fiddih, had prepared
> the samovar and tea in the room of His mother and informed us that the tea
> was ready. Accompanied by Him, I proceeded there. In His mother’s room,
> He drank some tea. Each moment added to my perplexity and conjecturing.
> With His blessed hand He poured a cup of tea, passed it to me, and with
> a heavenly smile said, “What is it that troubles you? You are distraught.” I
> drank the tea, which eased my perturbation and anxiety to some extent. I
> said, “Áqá, what exalted state was it that I witnessed in Your chamber last
> night?” He replied, “At what an extraordinary time you arrived! That was
> untimely. But it was the will of God that you should see it with your own
> eyes. Know and be certain that at that very moment the One Exalted God
> appointed Me for the guidance of these servants. I am that Promised One
> whose advent they have been expecting. For the past twelve hundred and
> sixty years they have perpetually beseeched the Almighty for His appearance.

I am the one appointed for the salvation of the people.”

Each mosque has one or more muʾadhdhin who announce the time for the obliga-
tory worship (salát).

As soon as I heard Him speak these words, I kissed His knees and became
> a believer in Him. In prostration, I raised my voice in gratitude to the Lord
> for having enabled me to recognize Him.63

> It was thus that the ﬁrst woman to believe in Him was the illustrious wife
> of the Báb, [Khadíjih Bagum], and among the men of this family [the
> Afnán], it was the martyred uncle, [Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí,] and among
> the ʿulamá it was Akhúnd Mullá Husayn Bushrúʾí, the Bábuʾl-Báb, whose
> story will be recounted next.

The Evidence Presented to Akhúnd Mullá Husayn in Shíráz

and How He Attained [Faith]64

> After the passing of Siyyid [Kázim Rashtí], who was a harbinger of this
> blessed Manifestation, the Akhúnd [Mullá Husayn] was aﬄicted with great
> perturbation and restlessness. Together with a group of fellow-students,
> who numbered more than forty, he undertook a period of meditation. The
> group included Áqá Mírzá [Siyyid] Muhammad-ʿAlí Barfurúshí,65 Mullá
> ʿAlí Bastámí, Akhúnd Mullá ʿAbduʾl-Jalíl Khúʾí, Mírzá ʿAbduʾl-Hádí, Mírzá
> Muhammad-Hádí, Áqá Siyyid Hasan Yazdí, Mullá Hasan Bajistání, Mullá
> Bashír, Mullá Báqir Turk, and Mullá Ahmad Abdal—all of them learned
> men who were expecting the manifestation of the Promised One. Details
> related to each one of them are captured in the historical narratives, and
our intention is only to recount the events of Fárs.

After a period of forty days of ascetic observance in the Masjid Kuﬁh
and Masjid Sahlih, the Akhúnd [Mullá Husayn] established a pact with

See Balyúzí, Khadíjih Bagum, pp. 10–13, for a diﬀerent rendering. In Kitáb Fihrist,
> the Báb states that the ﬁrst descent of Spirit on Him was on 15th of the third month
> of AH 1260 [3 April 1844]. From this it is possible to infer that the event described by
Khadíjih Bagum occurred on that date.

The section pertaining to Mullá Husayn correlates closely with the narrative of Siyyid
> Husayn Hamadání (see Táríkh-i Jadíd, pp. 35–39), which is purported to be based on
> recollections of Mírzá ʿAbduʾl-Wahháb Khurásání from utterances of Mullá Husayn and
> captured in the history of Hájí Mírzá Jání of Káshán. The present translator has not been
> able to determine if a copy of Mírzá Jání’s valuable history was in the possession of the
> early Afnán family. However, it is known that Mírzá Jání’s original text, which is about 80
> or pages long, is extant and is in the possession of a non-Baháʾí in Tihrán. Although he did
> not allow his precious manuscript to be copied, because of his longstanding friendship with
> Fádil Mázandarání he permitted the latter to examine this document, and he certiﬁed its
> authenticity. See Nabíl Aʿzam, The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 52–66, for Nabíl’s moving, though
very diﬀerent, description of the Báb’s declaration.

Quddús had returned to his native town some months prior to Siyyid Kázim’s passing;

> his companions that if any one of them should hear the Call of the Truth,
> he would inform the others at once. Feeling himself drawn towards Shíráz,
he set out.

Because he had been acquainted with His Holiness [the Báb] during
> His time in the ʿAtabát, when he arrived in Shíráz he desired a meeting [p.50]
> and inquired where His Holiness lived. He wished to pass the few days
> he would remain in Shíráz in His home. [Locating the Báb’s House], he
> knocked at the door, and His Holiness Himself came and opened the
> door. He warmly greeted and welcomed the Akhúnd, and expressed great
> kindness and aﬀection. Together they proceeded to the upper room that
> served as the guestroom. [The Báb] said, “All day I have felt disinclined
to go to the caravansary.66 Evidently this was because of your arrival.”

After they had exchanged the customary inquiries and pleasantries, tea
> was served, and the Host enjoyed it with the Akhúnd [Mullá Husayn].
> After showing him the courtesies due to a guest, the Host asked about
> the teachings and doctrines, the station and character of Shaykh [Ahmad]
> and Siyyid [Kázim]. Mullá Husayn replied, “Whatever the topic under
> discussion, their whole focus was the Traditions and sayings based on the
> glad tidings of the manifestation of the Promised One.” The Báb then
> asked, “You, the Shaykhís, have an essential doctrine that, after the pass-
> ing of the late Siyyid, there must be someone else who assumes his title.
> It is now ﬁve months since his death. After him, who is the leader of the
> cause?” “As yet,” [Mullá Husayn] replied, “we have recognized no one.
> After him, no successor is speciﬁed. Rather, we anticipate the Author of
> the Cause, Whose advent is expected by all, to appear.” “What manner
> of man,” He asked, “must the Author of the Cause be?” The Akhúnd
> pondered for a moment and then enumerated a certain number of the
> spiritual and physical67 characteristics of the expected Person. “Do you
> observe these in Me?” As Mullá Husayn had not observed any signs of
> knowledge during his Host’s residence in Karbalá and knew that He had
> not studied with the deceased teachers, responded, “I do not see any of
these qualities in you.” His Holiness did not respond to this.

After a while, [Mullá Husayn] observed several books in a small niche.
Examining one of them, he found it to be a commentary on the Surih

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh adds parenthetically: The Báb’s place of business was at the custom
building, known as the caravansary.

The original Arabic phrase literally means “theoretical and practical.”

> Baqara.68 After reading a little, he saw that it was a commentary like no
> other. He was astonished and asked who the author might be. “A mere
> youthful beginner,” He answered, “who has much other knowledge and
> attainments, in addition to this.” Again, he asked who and where the
> writer was. “You see Him.” Mullá Husayn did not apprehend His mean-
> ing, “You see Him.” He read another page, where it was written, “the
> explanation of the essence of the essence.” Considering this an error, he
> stated, “It should be, ‘the explanation of the essence’ ” He answered, “It
> is, ‘the explanation of the essence of the essence.’ What can I say! The
> Author of this commentary writes masterfully and with utmost authority.
> Consider the passage attentively.” This time, the Akhúnd read more closely
> and realized that the phrase, “exposition of the essence of the essence,” was
> correct as it was written. He said, “I am tired. You read some more, and
> I will listen.” His Holiness read for a time, and then with the customary
> haughtiness of an Akhúnd, Mullá Husayn said, “It is enough. That was
suﬃcient. Do not trouble Yourself any further.”

Mullá Husayn enjoyed lunch and then rested for a while. In the late
> afternoon, His Holiness had invited several merchants and Shaykhí ʿulamá
> to drink tea and meet the Akhúnd. [In the course of the conversation,] it
> was agreed that the next morning they would all gather at Masjid Ilkhání
where the Akhúnd would deliver a lecture.

The group gathered, as appointed, in the mosque. When the Akhúnd
> [Mullá Husayn] wanted to start his discourse, he found that in place of
> eloquent expression and clear explanations, he had become tongue-tied,
> to the extent that he lost all power of speech. Filled with amazement, he
> thought, “this is so contrary to custom and nature, it must have some
> purpose,” and he wondered “who is exercising this secret control, and
> what might be his object in rendering me mute and in such state of
> ecstasy that, in this gathering, I am like one who has been transported
[p.55] in spirit?”. Such was his powerlessness, and so strong the astonishment

> and emotion which took possession of him, that he was not able to speak
> on any topic, and he cancelled the meeting and returned to his lodgings,
deeply bewildered.

The next day when he wished to deliver his lecture, he found himself
> even more mute and devoid of ready knowledge than the previous day.

There was nothing he could do but apologize to the audience.

The same happened on the third day. On this last occasion, he departed
> from the mosque in a state of utmost misery and perplexity. The Exalted
> One, noting Mullá Husayn’s despondency, told the rest of their friends to
> go to their own houses, while he took Mullá Husayn, with his consent,
to His own home.

When they arrived at His Sacred House, after a short rest, the Báb
> said, “By what proofs and signs of his station, can you recognize the
> Author of the Cause, and by what proof can you pass from distraction
> and wandering in the valley of search to recognizing the Beloved and have
> complete conﬁdence in the guidance He gives?” Mullá Husayn answered,
> “By scientiﬁc writings and by the Exalted Point which is the well-spring
> and center of all the knowledge of past and future prophets and saints.”
> “Do you perceive these qualities in Me?” He inquired, “What if I were
> so endowed with such attributes?” Upon hearing this, Mullá Husayn was
> deeply perturbed, and said, “That You are devout, godly, and holy of life,
> is true; but innate knowledge and inﬁnite wisdom are the only entry and
> evidence of this most exalted Station.” At this comment, His Holiness
> was silent for while as though in wonder, while Mullá Husayn thought to
> himself, “What idea can this devout and sincere Youth be harboring that
> He so persistently introduces this topic, although he has no education? I
> must at all events ask some questions of His honored Person which He
> has never heard discussed and cannot answer, so that He may be turned
aside from His vain imaginings.”

Therefore, he presented to His Holiness a question which appeared to
> him very diﬃcult to resolve, and which he had always had in mind during
> the lifetime of the late Siyyid [Kázim], but had never found an opportu-
> nity of propounding it in such wise as to have the diﬃculty removed in
> a satisfactory manner. Without hesitation, his Host provided a full and
> suﬃcient answer. Mullá Husayn was ﬁlled with amazement. He asked
> another diﬃcult question, which his Host again answered comprehensively
> and conclusively. Mute with astonishment, [Mullá Husayn] reﬂected to
> himself, “Is not this Youth Who but a few days ago did not correctly
> read the Commentary on the Surih Baqara? How is it that He has now
> become the source and well-spring of all the sciences of the past?” All
manners of thoughts ﬁlled his being.

All of a sudden, he observed His Holiness anew: he was sitting in a
> most digniﬁed and majestic attitude, the left hand laid on the left knee and
> the right hand over it. He began to utter most wondrous verses contain-
> ing answers to whatever question passed through Mullá Husayn’s mind,
> until many verses had been revealed from the Fount of Divine Revelation.

At length He ceased, and [Mullá Husayn], in the extremity of terror,

> “Remain seated! Where are you going? Anyone who beholds you in this
> state would think you had lost your mind.” Constrained by His bidding,
> he could do nothing but sit again, while His Holiness withdrew to the
private section of the House.

During His absence, the Akhúnd [Mullá Husayn] was prey to most
> anxious thoughts. Care for worldly interests and the possibility of opposi-
> tion from divers quarters, the need for caution and prudence, all passed
> through his mind. However, he realized that in the presence of the Lord,
[p.60] he could not be insincere, nor oﬀer excuses and objections. He saw no way

> out save confession and acceptance. He was greatly perturbed, agitated,
and troubled beyond all measure.

An hour later, contrary to His practice on other days, the Báb Himself
> brought in the tea, seated Himself near Akhúnd [Mullá Husayn], and
> showered him with most gracious expressions. He poured tea [for Mullá
> Husayn] and handed him the cup, but the honored Akhúnd, remained as
> one distraught and so amazed that he again asked permission to depart.
> “You are still in a state of extreme bewilderment,” [the Báb] informed
> him, “though you are not yourself aware of it. Anyone who saw you in
this state, would think you were possessed.”

After an hour, however, when he had regained his composure, [Mullá
Husayn] was permitted to take his leave.69

On the occasion of the next visit, [Mullá Husayn] was shown a com-
mentary that the Báb had written on the Hadíth-i Jariyyih.70 He read it

The date of the Báb’s Declaration is ﬁxed in the Persian Bayán 6:13 and 2:7, “And
> from the moment when the Tree of the Bayán appeared until it disappeared is the Res-
> urrection of the Apostle of God, as is divinely foretold in the Qurʾán; the beginning of
> which was when two hours and eleven minutes had passed on the eve of the ﬁfth of
> Jamádíyuʾl-Avval, AH 1260 [22 May 1844], which is the year of 1270 of the Declara-
> tion of the Mission of Muhammad” (translation in Selections from the Writings of the Báb,
> p. 107). In a Tablet in honor of Mírzá Qábil of Ábádih, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá speciﬁes this date
as Kamál (8th) of Azamat; see Ishráq-Khávarí, Gangínih Hudúd va Ahkám, p. 426.

Ishráq-Khávarí, Kitáb Muhadhirat, p. 14, notes that Jariyyih was a daughter of Khadíjih,
> the wife of Muhammad. For a discussion of this Tradition of the Handmaiden attributed

> and recalled that the late Siyyid [Kázim] had stated when he was alive
> that the Proof Who was to appear would compose a full explanation of
> this Tradition. Now Mullá Husayn saw his Promised manifest before
> him. Moreover, he remembered that one day, when he was alone with
> the late Siyyid [Kázim] in the library, in the course of conversation, he
> [Mullá Husayn] had asked why the Surih Yúsuf [Joseph] of the Qurʾán
> is titled the Ahsanuʾl-Qisas [the Best of Stories], to which the late Siyyid
> had replied that it was not then the proper occasion for explaining the
reason. This incident remained concealed in his mind.

Now His Holiness said, “Mullá Husayn, do you recall inquiring once
> of the late Siyyid, why the Surih Yúsuf is called the Ahsanuʾl-Qisas, and
> how he replied that the proper occasion for explaining this had not yet
> come? The time for this explanation has now arrived.” Then He showed
> [Mullá Husayn] a commentary on this Surih revealed from the Most
> Exalted Pen. On reading it, the eminent Akhúnd attained the shore of
> faith and prostrated himself in gratitude to God.71

In the course of the ﬁrst section of the Báb, Kitáb Panj Shaʾn (the Book of Five Modes),
> p. 9, revealed on the sixth anniversary of His declaration, the Báb describes the night of His
declaration in the language of prayer:

> In the name of God. There is no God but God. Sanctiﬁed art Thou, O God, My God.
> I testify that at an hour such as this, Thou hast bestowed honor and exaltation, glory
> and loftiness upon this night and hast sanctiﬁed it above all other nights through Thy
> Manifestation. This is the hour of the appearance of the Point of Bayán, Who is the
> sign of Thy dawning, the countenance of Thy morn of eternity, the evidence of Thy
> unity, the manifestation of Thy oneness, the conﬁrmation of Thy loftiness, the signiﬁer
> of Thy holiness, and the very essence of the divinity of Thy kingdom. Sanctiﬁed and
> exalted art Thou, that thou hast gloriﬁed this hour by creating whatsoever is within
> the Bayán and by decreeing the manifestation of whatsoever Thou willest. I testify and
> all things testify that on such a night as this I was at My house before Thy threshold
> when the ﬁrst person [i.e., Mullá Husayn] who has tasted the sweetness of Thy love
> in this Ridván attained to Me. He prostrated himself before Thy eﬀulgence in this
> Paradise, and with him were the Letters of the Three. At such an hour, Thou didst
> cause Me to show Myself to him. Sanctiﬁed and exalted art Thou for enabling him
> [i.e., Mullá Husayn] to recognize upon hearkening unto the signs of Thy guidance,
> and for having created in him a clear vision when I made mention of Thee. Therefore
> praise and gratitude be to Thee, O My God, a praise the like of which no soul hath
> oﬀered in the past nor any will oﬀer in the future, and such gratitude as none before
> hath oﬀered and none will oﬀer in the future, for the ﬁrst who recognized My person,
> and for the recognition with which he recognized Me.

> From this passage it is not clear whether the three travel companions of Mullá Husayn also
> attained the presence of the Báb that very night, or on a later occasion.

Conversion of Mullá Sádiq Khurásání

> Mullá Husayn said, “During our stay at the Masjid Kuﬁh and Mas-
> jid Sahlih prior to dispersing [in search of the Promised Qáʾim], my
> companions and I established a pact that whichever of us ﬁrst heard the
> Call of Truth would inform the others. One in particular, Akhúnd Mullá
> Sádiq [known as] Muqaddas Khurásání, proceeded towards Isfahán and
> is now in that city. Please instruct me to go to Isfahán and to inform
> him so that he, too, may attain the station of faith.” “There is no harm
> in that,” the Báb replied, “however, it must be conditioned upon several
> things.” “Whatever is Your command,” [Mullá Husayn] responded, “I will
instantly and faithfully obey.”

The Báb then revealed a detailed commentary on one of the shorter
> Surihs of the Qurʾán and entrusted it to the honored Akhúnd Mullá
> Husayn, instructing him, “Take this commentary with you to Isfahán.
> After you have renewed your acquaintance with the Akhúnd [Mullá Sádiq
> Muqaddas], ﬁrst ask if, during his travels, he has heard of, or met, anyone
> who advanced a claim to be the Promised One? Should he respond that
> he has neither met a claimant nor heard of such a call, ask if he himself
> is putting forth a claim. Should he present one, he must conﬁrm it by
> means of divine verses, in the way that you have witnessed. Only if he
> states that he has no claim of his own are you to present him with this
> commentary, without identifying its Author, as he himself must discern
[the Source of Revelation].”

Mullá Husayn proceeded to Isfahán in accordance with the Báb’s
> instructions and upon arrival, was reunited with Mullá Sádiq. “O honored
> Akhúnd,” he asked him, “after we separated, did you meet any claimant
> or hear any call?” “I have encountered no one, and heard no call,” he
> replied. “Do you suspect any qualities in yourself, which could serve as
> evidence of some exalted station?” Deeply puzzled, Mullá Sádiq rejoined,
> “Have you gone mad? You and I are of no account. The One who raises a
> call must possess innate knowledge. Have you lost your rational faculties,
> that you ask such a question?”
[p.65]    Upon being certain of Mullá Sádiq’s position, in accordance with the

> Báb’s wish, he presented the commentary to him. After reading a little
> of it, Mullá Sádiq seized the hem of Mullá Husayn’s garment, demand-
> ing, “Who wrote this commentary? The Author of these words is cer-
> tainly the Truth. Where is He, and Who is He?” Refusing to answer his
> question directly, [Mullá Husayn] said “I am not permitted to say; you

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 28                                                                   7/10/2008 3:45:08 PM

> must discern it for yourself.” In the face of [Mullá Sádiq’s] insistence, he
remained adamant.

Soon the darkness of dusk fell, and supper was served. Afterwards, the
> honored Mullá Husayn retired, satisﬁed in the knowledge that he had
carried out the mission entrusted him in its totality.72

The story of Mullá Sádiq and the manner of his recognition is well
> loved and is no doubt related thoroughly in narratives of the history of
Isfahán. As such, this servant will not add to the burden of the reader.

In short, after achieving certitude, Mullá Sádiq together with several
> others proceeded to Shíráz so that they would attain the blessed presence
> [of the Báb]. Upon arrival in Shíráz, however, they learned that His Holi-
ness had departed on His journey to Mecca.

The honored Akhúnd Mullá Sádiq and his companions began to propa-
> gate the news of the Revelation, particularly in the Masjid Báqir-Ábád.
> Ascending the pulpit, they would present proofs to the people. This matter
> was reported to the ʿulamá, who consulted [on the matter]. By order of
> [the Governor] Husayn Khán, the Ajúdán-Báshí, known as Sáhib-Ikhtíyár,
> those illustrious personages were seized, beaten with sticks, their beards
> burnt, their noses pierced and a rope passed through the incision. From
> dawn to dusk, the executioner paraded them through the bazaar and
received a sum of money from each shopkeeper and artisan.

At sunset, those oppressed ones, being extremely hungry and fatigued,
and having been severely beaten and injured, were expelled from the city.73

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh has added the following marginal note in his own hand: “Áqá
> Mírzá ʿAlí-Muhammad, the illustrious son of Mullá Muhammad-Sádiq Muqaddas related
> for me the following description which he had heard from his honored father: ‘No mat-
> ter how I implored Mullá Husayn [to divulge the name of Him Who claimed to be the
> promised Manifestation], he refused and would only state that it was forbidden for him to
> do so and that I must seek Him independently. Disappointed by this response, I proceeded
> to the room set aside for devotions and performed my ablutions. I spread the prayer mat
> and began my supplications. I entreated with such earnestness that the tears pouring from
> my eyes dampened the prayer mat. In the midst of such contemplation and in a state of
> near-unconsciousness, I beheld the Young Siyyid that I had met in the gathering of late
> Siyyid [Kázim Rashtí]. He stood over me saying, ‘What do you desire? If you seek Faith,
> it stands apparent and manifest.’ This experience was repeated twice before dawn. After
> the third occurrence of this vision, I came to the room where Mullá Husayn was resting.
> I woke him and said, ‘Mullá Husayn, I have discovered the identity of the Master of this
> Cause. It must be none other than that same Shirází Siyyid that we met in the ʿAtabát.’
Mullá Husayn responded aﬃrmatively.”

A similar description is provided in Nabíl Aʿzam, The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 144–48

> relating to the events that befell Quddús, Mullá Sádiq, and Mullá ʿAlí-Akbar Ardistání

The Arrival of Quddús

> The aﬃrmation of faith of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí Barfurúshí, who
> was surnamed Quddús: He was among the ʿulamá and learned divines
> famous for piety and godliness, and because of his inner spirituality and
> purity, no sooner had he heard this Call than he set out for Shíráz to
investigate the matter.74

Upon arrival at that city and meeting the Báb in the street, without
> seeking proofs or signs, nor evidence or deductions, he instantly attained
> complete certitude. From the moment of that meeting, he ranked among
> the foremost disciples, manifesting unsurpassed qualities, displaying all-

> travelling to Mecca.78 Shaykh Háshim (a brother of the Imám-Jumʿih of
> Shíráz, Shaykh Abú-Turáb) who was much hated and very quarrelsome,
was also among this group of pilgrims.

That year, pilgrims from all corners of the world where Muslims live
> were proceeding towards Mecca, for according to the Islamic teachings,
> whenever the 10th day of Dhiʾl-Hajjih, which is the observance of the
> ʿId-i Adha [the Festival of Sacriﬁce], falls on a Friday, that pilgrimage is
> called the ‘Greater Pilgrimage,’ and that is the year of the Manifestation
> [of the Promised One]. According to a well-known Tradition, [on such
> an occasion], the Qáʾim will place His back against the wall in the court
of the Masjiduʾl-Ahrám and will openly declare His Cause.

At that time, journey by sea was most diﬃcult and disagreeable, as
> steam vessels did not operate in the Persian Gulf. It was necessary to go
> by sailing ship, which made the voyage to Jaddih by sea a minimum of
> three or four months. One day the late Hájí Abúʾl-Hasan [who had been [p.70]
> a travel companion of the Báb] described his pilgrimage journey to this
servant, saying:

> During the time I was in the presence of His Holiness aboard the ship,
> there was a large group of pilgrims, who for the most part were hostile
> [towards the Báb]. Among them was Shaykh Abú-Háshim who molested
> [Him] both verbally and physically, and would cause great discomfort for
> His Holiness. The aﬀront and nuisance he caused reached such a degree
> that on several occasions the captain of the ship came and reprimanded

From Búshihr, the Báb sent the following letter to His wife in Shíráz (Text quoted
> in Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, pp. 166–67, the original letter is displayed in the International
Baháʾí Archives in Haifa):

> O the best of Protectors! In the Name of God, the Exalted.
My sweet life! May thou be guarded by God!
It was not because of sadness that I did not write sooner,

Nor was it due to My heart being sorrowed
Nay, My hand wrote thee,

But My tears washed away the words.
God is My witness that I have been overcome with so much sorrow since our
> separation that it cannot be described. However, since we are all seized in the grasp
> of destiny, such has been decreed for us. May the Lord of the world, by the right-
eousness of the Five Near-Ones, ordain My return.

It is now two days since we arrived in Búshihr. The temperature is extremely hot,
> but the Lord of creation will protect [us]. Apparently, our ship will sail this very
> month. May God watch over Us, out of His mercy. At the time of departure, it was

> him not to torment the innocent Siyyid [i.e., the Báb]. However, he did
not change his behavior.

One day he started an argument with the captain and uttered such
> unseemly words that the latter became so aggravated that he instructed his
> sailors to seize the Shaykh and throw him in the sea. Greatly perturbed
> and enraged, the captain himself stood nearby, and the sailors hastened to
> bring the Shaykh to throw him in the sea. At that instant, His Holiness
> arrived and interceded. The captain did not accept [His intercession] and
commanded loudly, “Throw this accursed one into the sea!”

Seeing that they were about to throw the Shaykh in the sea, His Holi-
> ness threw Himself on the Shaykh and embraced him ﬁrmly, and pleaded
> with the captain to forgive the Shaykh’s oﬀences one more time, on His
> account. Deeply moved by the benevolence and the generosity manifested by
> His Holiness, the captain accepted His intercession. Then he said, “Master,
> this accursed one has wronged you more than anyone else, so You should
> be even more eager than others to see him perish. Why did You stop us?”
> “Such people only harm themselves,” the Báb said, “we should look upon
> their deeds with sin-covering eyes.” The meekness exhibited by His sacred
> Self and His intercession on behalf of the Shaykh caused a change of heart
> among many passengers, and they no longer displayed enmity and hatred,
instead becoming repentant and remorseful.

Once our ship had arrived at Jaddih, His Holiness proceeded towards
> Mecca. That year, there were innumerable pilgrims. Roughly speaking, the
> Arab, Turkish, Iranian, Kurdish, and Indian pilgrims, together totaling in
> excess of seventy thousand, for the most part came from the ranks of the
> ʿulamá and the learned. Many had mastered the science of divination and
> jafr [numerology] and had determined that in that year, the True Sum-
> moner would openly issue his summons in Mecca, and they had come to
witness the event.

Among them was the renowned Hájí Siyyid Jaʿfar Kashfí,79 who ranked
> as the ablest in the ﬁeld of numerology and who had a profound knowledge
> of jafr. He had studied the Hadíth-i Marvy narrated by the Immaculate
> One [the eighth Imám, ʿAlí ar-Ridá], upon Him rest peace: “In the year
> Sixty, His Cause will be made manifest and His Remembrance exalted,” and
> the allusions of certain mystics who had openly given many signs for His
> appearance, such as Sháh Niʿmatuʾlláh Valí, who in his poems had clearly
given the news of the Manifestation:
If thou reachest the year of planting ghars,80 behold,

the renewal of the sovereign, realm, nation, and faith.

The renowned father of Vahíd Dárábí and one of the most distinguished theologians
> of his generation. For a detailed discussion of his life and writings, see Rabbani, The Bábís
of Nayríz: History and Documents.

According to the Abjad system, ghars has a numerical value of (1000+200+60=)1260,
hence signifying the year of the appearance of the Báb.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 32                                                                                        7/10/2008 3:45:08 PM

And again:
With the passing of ghars years,

I see the Absent One has appeared.
And also in the collection of poetry by Khajih Háﬁz:
Behold the crest of the moon in Muharram,

and drink from the wine cup,
> Since this is a sign of safety and absence of harm,
and augurs the year of peace and love.

He [i.e., Siyyid Jaʿfar] had studied these according to the science of
> numerology and had consulted an expert in divination: “As this is the year
> ‘sixty,’ will the Qáʾim appear in Mecca?” To which he had received an aﬃr-
> mative response. He had then asked, “If I go [on pilgrimage], will I attain
> the presence of the Qáʾim?” And again he had received a positive response.
> The Siyyid had then asked if he was destined to become a follower of the
Qáʾim, to which the expert responded: “You will not become a believer.”

I myself met Hájí Siyyid Jaʿfar in Mecca. He saw [the Báb] with his own
> eyes and heard [Him proclaim His Faith] with his own ears but did not
become a believer.

Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí [Quddús], some other believers, and I were
> in His blessed presence [of the Báb]. After the conclusion of the pilgrim-
> age rites throngs of pilgrims were present in the Masjiduʾl-Haram, and all [p.75]
> the courtyards and rooftops overﬂowed with waves of people. His Holiness
> approached the Shrine and leaned His blessed back against the Kaʿbih,
> holding the door-chain with His sacred Hand. With the utmost clarity
> and eloquence He announced three times loudly: “I am the Qáʾim Whose
appearance you have been expecting!”

It was a true wonder that despite of the massive multitude and the noise,
> as soon as the Báb begun to speak a complete silence overcame that whole
> area in such wise that if a bird were to ﬂap its wings, everybody would hear.
> Once complete silence was established over everyone, He uttered the same
> blessed proclamation three times, with the utmost distinctness, so that all
the pilgrims could hear.

The pilgrims were recounting and translating the Báb’s words for one
> another. All conversations among the multitude concerned only this event.
> Indeed, the very ﬁrst topic that the pilgrims of every land wrote about to
> their kinfolk was that a young merchant and Siyyid, twenty-ﬁve years of
> age, had taken hold of the Kaʿbih’s chain and with resounding voice had
advanced the claim of the Qáʾimiyyat.

In a short time, this news was spread in all parts of the world. Those
> who sought the Truth and whose souls were prepared to attain any degree
> of certitude responded, “We hear and obey!”81 and made haste on the
> pathway of Faith.

CHAPTER FOUR

RETURN OF THE BÁB TO SHÍRÁZ

Return from Búshihr

> The time was nigh for the arrival of His Holiness in Shíráz.83 Shaykh Abú- [p.77:6]
> Háshim, [brother of Imám-Jumʿih,] wrote a most provocative account to
> Shíráz, promoting mischief and raising the cry, “Our religion is lost!” A
> great excitement was caused when his letter reached Shíráz. A contingent
> of the ʿulamá, such as Shaykh Husayn Zalim [the tyrant], known as the
> Názimuʾsh-Shariʿah; Akhúnd Mullá Muhammad-ʿAlí Mahallátí; Shaykh
> Mahdí Kajawví; and a score of others went before Husayn Khán, who
> was at that time the governor-general of Shíráz. They complained, “The
> Siyyid Who publicly claimed [the station of ] the Qáʾimiyyat and the
> Bábiyyat84 in Mecca will shortly arrive [in Shíráz], and you must join
> with the adherents of Islam in quenching this ﬁre and silencing this Call,
> so it is kept under control.” Husayn Khán gave in to the ﬂattery of the

Him to Shíráz.

Late one afternoon, His Holiness was standing on an elevation by

> Mubárak, “Go quickly and ask the soldiers where they are going and
> what their mission is.” In accordance with His command, Hájí Mubárak
> approached the soldiers and asked where they were going. The soldiers,
> being argumentative, said, “Where we are going and what we are doing is
> none of your business, black man!” Hájí Mubárak returned to His presence
> and informed Him, “The horsemen refused to say what their mission is.”
> The Báb said, “Go and tell them to come to Me.” Hájí Mubárak went
> to the soldiers and said, “My Master asked that you should be so kind as
to come, so that we can make your acquaintance.”

A certain Aslán Khán, who was older and wiser than the rest, came
> back with Hájí Mubárak and attained His blessed presence. He was asked,
> “Where are you going and what mission have you been given?” The
> soldier again refused to divulge their orders. The Báb said, “No reason
[p.80] to conceal it: your mission is to take the Siyyid-i Báb to Shíráz. Do not

> trouble yourselves. I stand ready. If you went on to Búshihr according to
> your orders and passed this village by, you would not accomplish your
> mission.” The oﬃcial looked closely at His Countenance and noted all the
> signs that he had been given in Shíráz to identify Him and realized that
> this was the Siyyid in person. He returned to his companions and reported
> what had transpired, which caused them all to exclaim with wonder, “If
> a man is sought by the government or the people, it is only natural for
> him to ﬂee the oﬃcers sent to take him under guard from one place to
> another. How is it then that with the utmost courage and ﬁrmness this
> Personage has come forward, informing us that He is undoubtedly the
object of our quest? Of a certainty He must be of the true!”

The valor of the Báb awakened the consciousness of the men. They
> attained His blessed presence, and His Holiness showered upon them His
> immense kindness and benevolence. He instructed Hájí Mubárak to serve
> them the supper he had prepared, as these men had been traveling and
> were hungry and tired. Hájí Mubárak served the same quantity of food that
> he had prepared for two persons and brought it. The men saw that there
> was very little food and that it would not even suﬃce one of them, but
> they sat to dine and ate their ﬁll. This experience deepened their wonder.

In the course of the journey they witnessed many such miracles.86

In a Tablet dated 24 Jamádíyʾth-Thání AH 1261/30 June 1845 to His uncle, Hájí

> this journey (A.Q. Afnán, private communications, August 1993).

return of the báb to shíráz                      37

Return of the Exalted One from Mecca to Shíráz in AH 1261 [1845]

> In all events, after the true ʿulamá, who were the heralds of the Mani-
> festation, had raised the news of the Cause throughout the realm and it
> had been particularly widely reported in Shíráz, His Holiness returned
> from Mecca in AH 1261. When He proclaimed His Cause publicly in
> Mecca, the news spread even further than before. This is reported in all
the histories of the Cause and will be recounted brieﬂy here as well.

In short, His Holiness arrived in Shíráz in the company of the guards.

> They proceeded directly to the governor’s oﬃce and reported their arrival.
> They recounted all that had occurred—how they had met Him at the
> ﬁrst staging-post at Dálakí and what they had seen with their own eyes
> along the way—to the Nizamuʾd-Dawlih. Husayn Khán ordered that His
> Holiness should be detained. This news spread fast. Some ignorant people
> with a reputation for knowledge were present and began to torment and
> mock [the Báb]. They attributed to Him what was applicable to themselves.
Shaykh Husayn Zálim tormented His Holiness with his own hand.

When the maternal uncle [of the Báb] and the revered mother of His
> Holiness were informed of these events, they were deeply perturbed. The
> latter went to her brother, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, and began to lament
and bewail [over the condition of her Son].

The Báb’s maternal uncle departed for the governor’s oﬃce. On meet-
> ing Husayn Khán, he said, “It is reported that His Holiness has returned
> from the exalted city of Mecca, and His mother and other members of
> His family have been awaiting His arrival. Why have you detained Him?
> Is He not a descendant of the Prophet of God? Is there no shame before
> His illustrious Ancestor?” Noting the forceful manner in which the uncle
> defended Him, Husayn Khán replied, “If you will mediate and serve as
> a guarantor that He will not go to meet with anyone, that no one will
> be admitted to Him, and that He will not write anything or share His
writing with anyone, I will release Him.”

Because the illustrious uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, was respected
> by the merchants and associated with reputable people, he responded,
> “I associate with men from all strata of society, and His Holiness is my
> Nephew and has returned from Mecca. Naturally, the people want to [p.85]

> say that He may not see people?” Faced with irrefutable logic, Husayn
> Khán responded, “For three days, people may come and go, but on the
> fourth day, you are to close the door to all and allow no one to visit your
> house.” Having given his surety on these terms, the uncle brought His
Holiness home with him.

[Upon the Báb’s arrival home], His mother and His blessed wife, along
> with other friends and relatives, attained His honored presence, and for
> three days all the believers and friends delighted in this union and ben-
> eﬁted from its immeasurable spiritual bestowal. Divine verses were sent
> down like a continuous rain: all were recorded in His own blessed Hand
on large sheets of cashmere paper and bestowed upon the visitors.

On completion of the three days, all access was denied to the friends,
> and no one was permitted to attain the presence [of the Báb]. However,
> even if the Sun of Reality is covered by a sullen cloud of formal restric-
> tions, its radiance and eﬀulgence shines ever more apparent. Consequently,
> although to all appearances the believers were denied access [to the Báb],
> they still continued to submit to Him their questions and diﬃculties,
> and to receive replies, for it is incumbent on the generous to answer him
> who asks, especially when the questions refer to religious matters, and
> the demands are for guidance and direction in the path of salvation. The
> result was that many people, including people from the surrounding areas,
> came to inquire into the matter, submitted their questions, and received
> full and satisfactory answers, each according to his own capacity, so that
> they too were led to believe.87

Arrival of Vahíd Dárábí

> One of those who attained the presence [of the Báb] in Shíráz was the
> honored Áqá Siyyid Yahyá Dárábí. His story is wonderful and amazing:
> he was the illustrious son of Hájí Siyyid Jaʿfar Kashfí, who has been men-
> tioned in the recollections of Hájí Abúʾl-Hasan, in the section pertaining
to Mecca.

[Siyyid Yahyá Dárábí] was eminent among the mujtahids and students
> of truth, gifted with supernatural faculties and an exalted spiritual station,
> unrivalled in debate and investigation, no less than for his austerity and
> piety. At that time he was in Tihrán. The late Muhammad Sháh Qájár

> trusted him profoundly, to the extent that he would not take any action or
> assign any task contrary to the permission and the fatwa of Siyyid Yahyá.
> When the news of this Cause reached the monarch’s ears, he summoned
> the honored Áqá Siyyid Yahyá and said, “According to the information
> received at our court, a certain Personage in Fárs has advanced a claim to
> the stations of Qáʾimiyyat and Bábiyyat. As you enjoy our utmost con-
> ﬁdence, you must proceed at once to Fárs, and fully investigate a matter
> of such universal purport. Send word to our court regarding the truth or
> falsity of these claims, so that we may know our civil and religious duties.
> You must depart with all haste, and write a prompt report on this issue
> for us.” He provided for his expenses, ordered that he be provided with
a horse, and sent him on his way to Shíráz.

Upon arrival at Shíráz he met with the honored Hájí Siyyid Javád
> Karbaláʾí, who was a scholar of divinity and wise in the wisdom of the
> eternal. The two had been friends and associates in the ʿAtabát. Through
> him, [Siyyid Yahyá] met with several other [Bábí] ʿulamá and prominent
> believers and, having explained the purpose of his investigation, requested
> a meeting [with the Báb]. However, the summons was delayed because of
> various obstacles. He spent the interval in examining some of the revealed
> verses. Finding in them no ground for objection or denial, he said in
> conﬁdence to the honored Hájí Siyyid Javád, “These luminous words and
> verses bear witness to the truth of the claim and leave no room for doubt;
> yet were I permitted to behold some miracle or sign beyond this, I would
> gain a fuller certitude and assurance.” That illustrious person answered, [p.90]
> “If we were to ask that Perfect Reality for wonders and miracles, we would
> be like those who have seen a thousand marvels more wonderful than the
> fabled cleaving of the moon, but are so befuddled that they continue to
seek light from a candle or lantern in the full blaze of the radiant sun.”

In short, Áqá Siyyid Yahyá prepared a petition, requesting that a com-
> mentary on the blessed Surih of Kawthar be revealed for his ediﬁcation.
> One night, about four hours after sunset, he himself took this supplication
> to the Blessed House of the Báb and attained His presence, presenting
> his request. [The Báb] instructed him to return at dawn to receive the
response to his request.

In the early dawn, as bidden, [Siyyid Yahyá] again attained His presence
> and was given the response in the form of an unrivaled commentary on
> the Surih of Kawthar extending to nearly ﬁve thousand written verses.88

He returned with it to his own home. Then, astonished by the number

For comparison, the Qurʾán is slightly more than 6,600 verses.

> and quality of its luminous verses, on meeting the honored Siyyid Javád
> Karbaláʾí, he remarked, “I have beheld a marvel a hundred-thousand-fold
> beyond what I have [previously] witnessed, for, with all my learning and
> scholarship, I spent nine whole days in writing one single page of ques-

> I presented them myself, and at dawn, I received such a response! I am
> astonished that these luminous verses, of such eloquence and clarity of
> style, should be revealed and written down during ﬁve or six hours of the
latter part of the night, which is the time for His rest and sleeping.”

As soon as Áqá Siyyid Yahyá had studied that most precious proof, he
> prostrated himself in adoration, and attained certitude. After a sojourn of
> some little while, during which the honor of an interview was accorded

> Marvast [Marv-Dasht], to proclaim the blessed Cause and to teach the

The Báb’s Public Announcement at Masjid Vakíl

> In all events, the enmity of enemies was now manifest in the utmost
> degree, and they exerted many eﬀorts to prevent the friends from attain-

> the devotion of the believers and the grandeur of the Cause withstood

entered the House of His Holiness.

ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd Khán, the Dárúghih, who was charged with carrying

middle, taking half with him.

The Dárúghih thereupon went before Husayn Khán, telling the latter

> and instructed that sticks90 be brought. The illustrious uncle, who was a
> greatly respected Siyyid and more than sixty years of age, was struck with [p.95]

> unable to walk] the farrashes carried him over their shoulders to his house
where he remained injured in bed for a period of time.

His Holiness was subject to brutal treatment and imprisoned in the

compelled to recant His claim.

One afternoon all the ʿulamá gathered in the Government House, that

must be forced to withdraw His claim.

My brother, Hájí Mírzá Buzurg, and I were present once when the

> Shíráz from every strata to gather in the Masjid Vakíl where the Siyyid-i
> Báb would renounce His claims. I went to the mosque as well and exerted
> particular eﬀort to ﬁnd a spot near [the pulpit] where I could behold Him
> and clearly hear His utterances and speech. From the morning of that day,
> rank upon rank of onlookers arrived at the mosque, and by three o’clock
> in the afternoon the entire courtyard, the cloisters, the roofs, and even
> the minarets of the mosque were thronged with people. The governor, the
> ʿulamá, the merchants, and other dignitaries entered and sat in the cloisters,
> near the stone pulpit. (This is a pulpit carved out of one piece of marble
and has fourteen steps.)

I was sitting near the pulpit when a commotion was raised in the court-
> yard: “He is coming!” He entered through the cloister’s entrance accompanied
> by ten farrashes and ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd Khán, the Dárúghih, and drew near the
> pulpit. The Báb was wearing a turban and an ʿabá and walked with such
> dignity, might, grandeur, and magniﬁcence that it is truly indescribable.
> Such a multitude of people in attendance meant nothing to Him, and He
heeded them not in the least.

He said to the ʿulamá and the governor, “What is your purpose in sum-
> moning Me to this place?” They responded, “The intention is that You
> should ascend this pulpit and repudiate Your false claim so that this fury
> and excitement may subside.” [The Báb] did not respond and ascended the
> pulpit where He stood on the third step. With great vehemence, Shaykh
> Husayn Zálim said, “Ascend to the top of the pulpit so everyone can see
> You and hear Your voice.” His Holiness ascended to the top of the pulpit
> and sat there. Suddenly, an absolute silence prevailed and not a whisper
> could be heard from the people, and it seemed as if not a soul was in that
mosque. Everyone was listening most attentively.

At ﬁrst, with utmost majesty and sovereignty, He commenced recitation
> of an exquisite Arabic homily with absolute eloquence and clarity that lasted
> some half an hour. The entire concourse of people, high and low, learned
> and illiterate alike were in total rapture and listened with great fascination.
> People’s silence, caused agitation in Shaykh Husayn who said to the governor,
> “Have you summoned the Siyyid in the presence of these people to establish
> the validity of His Cause or to recant His false claim? He is casting a spell
> on the assemblage with His enchanting speech. Instruct Him to say what
> He was intended to say. What drivel is He uttering?” Husayn Khán, the
> Sáhib-Ikhtíyár, said [to the Báb], “Siyyid, state what they [i.e., the ʿulamá]
[p.100]         have told you to aﬃrm, what is this idle chatter?” His Holiness remained

> silent for a moment and then uttered, “O People, know this well and be

> of Resurrection, and what He forbade remains forbidden unto the Day of
> Resurrection.’ In accordance with this Hadíth-i Marví from the Immaculate
One, ‘Verily, the Qáʾim will usher forth the Day of Resurrection.’ ”

Having recited this Tradition, He then descended the pulpit. Many of

Fatwá Against the Báb

> After His Holiness returned from the mosque and was placed under
> house-arrest at the home of ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd Khán, the entire body of
> the ʿulamá assembled and ﬁxed their seal on a fatwá decreeing the death
> of His Holiness. Among those present who signed the document was

> source of all sedition and the prime instigator of mischief. Others were
> Shaykh Abú-Háshim, Shaykh Asaduʾlláh, Shaykh Mihdí Kujúry, Mullá
> Muhammad-ʿAlí Mahallátí, and those like them. They wrote whatsoever
they wished and signed that paper.

That congregation then proceeded to the home of the late Shaykh

> the Shaykh, they acquainted him with their purpose and presented the
> document, requesting him to ﬁx his seal on the paper as well so that the
> matter of the Siyyid be concluded [and the Báb be slain]. Upon perusing
> the fatwa and considering its content, the Shaykh, profoundly moved
> with indignation, threw the paper to the ground and cried, “Have you
> lost your faculties! Never will I sign such a paper, as I have no misgiv-

Departure for Isfahán

others followed from all ranks of society.

A large number died. It chanced that the two young sons of ʿAbduʾl-

Upon arrival in the city of Isfahán, the late Manuchihr Khán, the

In the language of prayer, the Báb gives an outline of the events that had befallen
Him:

> Thou art aware, O My God, that since the day Thou didst call Me into being out of
> the water of Thy love till I reached ﬁfteen years of age I lived in the land that wit-
> nessed My birth [Shíráz]. Then Thou didst enable Me to go to the seaport [Búshihr]
> where for ﬁve years I was engaged in trading with the goodly gifts of Thy realm
> and was occupied in that which Thou favored Me through the wondrous essence
> of Thy loving-kindness. I proceeded therefrom to the Holy Land [Karbalá] where I
> sojourned for one year. Then I returned to the place of My birth. There I experienced
> the revelation of Thy sublime bestowals and the evidences of Thy boundless grace. I
> yield Thee praise for all Thy goodly gifts, and I render Thee thanksgiving for all Thy
> bounties. Then at the age of twenty-ﬁve I proceeded to Thy sacred House [Mecca],
> and by the time I returned to the place where I was born, a year had elapsed. There
> I tarried patiently in the path of Thy love and beheld the evidences of Thy manifold
> bounties and loving-kindness until Thou didst ordain for Me to set out in Thy direc-
tion and to migrate to Thy presence.

> is a wicked and ill-natured man, upon discovering that I no longer reside
> within His grasp, he will injure my kinsmen and family. My purpose is to
> ask your Excellency to petition Husayn Khán that he may not disturb [My
> family].” As soon as this request was made by his distinguished Guest, the
> late Muʿtamiduʾd-Dawlih wrote a detailed letter to the governor-general
> of Fárs, with words to the eﬀect that “the Siyyid-i Báb is a guest in my
> abode in Isfahán, and I stand as His protector. Should the government
> summon Him [to Tihrán for further inquiry], I will personally deliver
> Him. You have no cause to harass His family or inﬂict disturbance upon
them.” This letter was sent to Shíráz with a special envoy.

When the epidemic subsided to a prescribed degree, the people who
> had ﬂed the city returned forthwith, including Husayn Khán who [as
> anticipated by the Báb] immediately inquired from ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd Khán
> the whereabouts of His Holiness. The latter responded, “As the epidemic
> raged uncontrollably throughout the land and my wife and sons had fallen
> victim to the illness as well, I could no longer properly minister His aﬀairs
> and as such asked Him to retire to His own dwelling.” Deeply angered
> by the turn of events, Husayn Khán instructed ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd Khán to
> proceed at once in company of ten farrashes and search the home of His
> Holiness or wherever else He might be and bring Him forthwith to the
> government-house.

Persecution of the Báb’s Family

> As instructed, they proceeded immediately to the House of His Holiness
> and, not ﬁnding Him there, proceeded to the home of His illustrious
> uncle, [Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí,] but were unable to locate the latter at
[p.110] home either. They then proceeded to the residence of the late Hájí Mírzá

> Abúʾl-Qásim. The latter was a paternal cousin of the Báb’s mother and a
> brother of the honored wife of the Báb, [Khadíjih Bagum,] and at the time
> was the renowned standard-bearer of the family. My maternal grandmother
[Zahrá Bagum], who was the sister of the Báb’s wife, related:

> My late brother, that is, Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim, was home suﬀering from
> cholera and resting in bed due to weakness caused by the illness, when
> some time before noon, there was a violent knock on our door. The entire
> household was deeply disturbed. Fírúz, our black, house-born servant, went
> to inquire who it was when suddenly and without warning, ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd
> Khán, the Dárúghih, in the company of a number of farrashes and some
> other lewd characters entered our home and ﬁlled the courtyard. A most
> disturbing uproar ensued as they hurriedly searched the house for any trace

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 46                                                                           7/10/2008 3:45:10 PM

> of His Holiness and disappointed [in their inability to locate the Báb,] came
> to the room where my late brother was resting in bed due to his illness.
> The farrashes placed him on their shoulders and took him before Husayn
Khán, the Sáhib-Ikhtíyár.

Profoundly infuriated, the latter inquired callously, “Where lies the Siyyid-i
> Báb?” “I have been aﬄicted with cholera,” my brother replied, “and still suﬀer
> from the illness. As such, I do not know His whereabouts, nor do I have
> any news of Him.” Husayn Khán dealt with him most harshly and severely
> and ﬁnally he was granted ﬁfteen days to either present His Holiness or to
> pay a ﬁne of ﬁfteen-hundred tumáns.95 Reluctantly, he accepted. Then the
> governor asked for a guarantor, and Hájí Muhammad-Sádiq Isfahání, who
> ranked among the best known and most respected of the merchants and who
> was a very close friend of the honored Hájí, stood in this capacity. After a
surety was extracted, the Hájí was dismissed and returned home.

After the lapse of the agreed upon days, farrashes were sent to summon
> the Hájí [Abúʾl-Qásim] to the governor’s oﬃce and to present him before
> Husayn Khán. The latter, once again, spoke most sternly demanding either
> the delivery of His Holiness or the sum of ﬁfteen-hundred tumáns. The more
> the Hájí implored for mercy and the more he swore that he was bereft of any
> news from Him, the angrier the governor grew. Finally, [unable to withstand
> the governor’s admonishments,] the Hájí fell to the ground unconscious,
> and it was at that moment that the special envoy sent from Isfahán bearing
> the letter of the late Muʿtamiuʾd-Dawlih arrived and the envelope displaying
the seal of Manuchihr Khán presented to Husayn Khán.

Upon considering its content, [Husayn Khán] realized that he could no
> longer cause trouble or remonstrate, but he nevertheless extracted ﬁfteen-
hundred tumáns from him before allowing the late Hájí to leave.

He further issued a command that hereafter should any piece of paper
> be found in that city bearing the handwriting of His Holiness or a verse
revealed by Him, he would demolish that house.

Husayn Khán rounded up all the believers and devotees of His Holiness,
> and, after administering severe beatings with sticks and causing them much
> injury, he extracted from the victims whatever sum they could muster.

> Husayn Khán was an ill-natured, wicked man, and His Holiness the
> Exalted One has described his evil doings in the Khutbih-i Qahriyyih
> addressed to Hájí Mírzá Aqásí, and the reader may refer to that Tablet.96
> From his contemptible, base, and malicious deeds, it can readily be dis-
> cerned how truly evil and corrupt a person Husayn Khán was.

Fifteen-hundred tumáns represented an extraordinarily large sum of money for that
time.

> “was never able to pass a sound judgment.”

The Fate of the Báb’s Writings

In short, my late maternal grandmother would continue relating:

> After the governor’s order was noised in the city, whoever had received such
> Writings [revealed by the Báb] would bring them in bundles and deposit
> the packs in a long vestibule in the house of Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim. One
> side of the courtyard was ﬁlled with such Writings stacked high, all penned
> on large exquisite cashmere papers in the hand of His Holiness. Were even
> a page of those precious Writings available today, it would surely be worth
> an immense fortune. Those papers all contained innumerable commentaries,
> prayers, homilies, and scientiﬁc treaties on diverse themes. The illustrious
> uncle97 of the Báb was asked in what manner were we to dispose of those
> Writings, and he had made reply, “These are all the Words of God and as
> such cannot be treated disrespectfully. Wash the papers and throw the water
> in the well of the courtyard.”
[p.115]                 We placed four large washtubs on the ground of the courtyard, and the

> four of us, that is, the mother [of the Báb], Khadíjih Bagum, the wife of
> Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim,98 and I began to place stacks of these papers in
> the tubs and washed them much like cloths are washed by hand. Page by
> page, the ink was washed away from all the sheets, and the water and the
> papers thrown down the well.99

> Presumably, a reference to Hájí Mírzá Siyyid-ʿAlí.

CHAPTER FIVE

VAHÍD AND THE NAYRÍZ EPISODES

> Subsequent to the departure of His blessed Person [the Báb], the friends [p.115:5]
> in Shíráz observed wisdom and lived in serenity and tranquility. No other
> event took place for a while until the episode of the honored Áqá Siyyid
Yahyá Dárábí and the events of Nayríz transpired.

Earlier in these pages mention was made that the venerable Áqá Siyyid
> Yahyá, [surnamed] Vahíd, came to Yazd from the direction of Bávanát.
> It is important to describe brieﬂy in these pages the occurrences associ-
> ated with his stay in Yazd so that the sequence of events is clariﬁed. Of a
> certainty, the full story of his visit and of the events of Yazd is either told
> in the history of that town [by other narrators], or it will be related.100

Vahíd in Yazd

> After the illustrious Vahíd had believed and pledged submission, in
> accordance with His hallowed instruction [i.e., the Báb’s], he took leave
> of the Latter and set out in direction of Yazd for the ediﬁcation of the
> people, the promulgation of the Word of the Almighty, and the teaching
> of the Cause of God. For a while during the earlier period of his mission
> in that city he had expounded and taught the doctrines of His Holiness
> in gatherings of only such among the accomplished and the learned as
> were prepared and ﬁtted to hear them. But afterwards, according to the
purport of the verse:

Prudence and love can ne’er walk hand in hand,
and the verse:
Love and fair fame must wage eternal war;

O lover, halt not at the beloved’s door!

For the most part, the remainder of this section correlates with the narrative of Siyyid
> Husayn Hamadání, and as such, to the extent possible, the present translation has followed
> the rendering in Táríkh-i Jadíd, pp. 115–26.

> he began openly to proclaim the truth of the Cause and converted a great
> multitude, as well as leading many to profess devotion and sympathy who,
> not having reached the stage of conviction and the haven of assurance,
> were yet greatly attracted and manifested empathy. At length, through
> the oﬃciousness of certain mischievous persons, the governor of Yazd was
> informed of what was taking place. The governor, fearing for himself, sent
> a body of men to arrest him [i.e., Vahíd]. A triﬂing altercation occurred,
> and thereupon the governor readied for battle and prepared to eﬀect his
capture by force of arms.

The esteemed Áqá Siyyid Yahyá retired with a number of his followers
> and friends into the citadel of Yazd, while the myrmidons of the governor
> surrounded it and commenced hostilities and agitation. At length, the
> matter escalated into actual warfare, in the course of which some thirty
> or more of the governor’s men and the rogues and vagabonds [of the
> city who had joined them] were killed, while seven of [Vahíd’s] friends
> and companions were also slain, the rest being besieged for some time
> until some, unwilling to endure further suﬀering or withstand trial,
dispersed.

His honor [Vahíd] therefore determined to set out for Shíráz and said
> one night, “If one of you could manage to lead out my horse, so that I
> might defuse this incident and convey myself to some other place, it would
> be well.” A certain Hasan who had been for some time in attendance upon
> his honor and had performed his service with the utmost faithfulness and
> devotion, witnessing on the part of his august master many a display of
> miraculous and supernatural faculties, replied, “By your leave, I will lead
> out the horse.” “They will capture and slay you,” [responded Vahíd]. “In
> the path of your servitude,” rejoined [Hasan], “that is easy to bear. No
ambition have I beyond it.”

So he was allowed to go and, even as had been foretold, they took the
> youth captive outside the citadel and brought him before the governor,
> who ordered him blown from the mouth of a cannon. As they bound
> him to the gun, he begged the gunners: “Bind me, I pray you, with my
> face toward the gun that I may see it ﬁred.” Gunners and bystanders alike
> were astonished at his composure and cheerfulness, and indeed one who
> can be cheerful in such a plight must needs have great faith, capacity,
> and fortitude. It is seemly indeed that one be so joyous and jubilant at
> such an hour!

vahíd and the nayríz episodes                                   51

In short, that honored personage [Vahíd] succeeded in eﬀecting his
> departure from the citadel with one other, and set out for Shíráz, and
from there he proceeded to Nayríz.101

After his withdrawal, the governor vanquished his followers. Several [p.120]
> were taken captive and put to death, while from the rest, after they had
> suﬀered divers torments, ﬁnes of money were exacted.

Vahíd’s Arrival at Nayríz

> Now when that honored personage arrived in Nayríz, where his wife
> resided and where he had many friends, many became believers, others
> denied, while still others caviled and remained in doubt. Though formerly
> professing the most devout attachment and humility towards his person,
> no sooner did the district governor perceive that a struggle was imminent
> and the government might slip from his hands, than he sent word to
> him [i.e., Vahíd] saying, “I do not consider it expedient that you should
> continue any longer in this province. It is best that you should depart
> with all speed to some other place.” To this the honored visitor replied,
> “I have returned here, after a prolonged absence, to learn how matters
> fare, and to see my wife and family, neither do I wish to interfere with
> anyone. What makes you order me to quit my house and abode, instead
> of aﬀording me protection, and observing towards me the friendship and
> respect that is my due? Do you not fear God, and have you no shame
before my Ancestor?”

So when the governor saw that he heeded not his words and answered
> him sharply, he was ﬁlled with obstinate spite and strove to raise a tumult,
> inciting such men of every class and kind as were most wicked and mis-
> chievous to make a disturbance and drive out the honored personage. In
> turn Vahíd, perceiving this, repaired to the mosque and after performing
his devotions ascended the pulpit, and thus spoke:

> O people! Am I not he whose opinions you were wont to follow in all
> religious questions? In your needs and trials, as well as in all matters of
> doctrine, practice, and religious tradition were you not wont to prefer my

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh has added the following marginal note in his own hand about Vahíd’s
> visit to Bávanát subsequent to the Shíráz journey: In Bávanát, the Shaykhuʾl-Islám of Mazijan,
> one of the villages of Bávanát, converted, and together they proceeded to Nayríz.

The Bábí Encampment

> In short, Vahíd came forth from the mosque, quitted the city, and was
> compelled to alight in a ruined castle close by, the friends who bore him
> company being not more than seventeen in number. But even after he
> had left the city, his malicious and mischievous persecutors ceased not
> from their evil designs, for they pursued him with a great throng, scour-
> ing the country in all directions until they discovered his ruined retreat.
> Thereupon, they laid siege to the castle from every side and initiated
hostilities.

Then the honored personage commanded seven of his men to go out
> and drive them away, and gave them full instructions as to the ordering
> of battle, adding that whoever should occupy a certain position would
> be slain by a wound, and that such as went in a certain direction would
> return unhurt. One among those present, a young lad of Yazd, good of
> heart and comely of countenance, arose and said, “I beseech you to suf-
> fer me to be the ﬁrst among this much-wronged band and precede my
[p.125] comrades in martyrdom.” And that honored personage kissed him on the
cheek and intoned a prayer for him.

Then the illustrious defenders of the castle sallied swiftly forth, attacked
> the foes, and ere long scattered them forthwith. But the Yazdí lad, even as

> of martyrdom, escaped from the bonds of earth’s deceits, and gained the
> everlasting world and life eternal—blessings were his, and his end was
good. The rest returned victorious.

At the very time of these events, the exalted Navváb, Prince Farhád
> Mírzá,103 recently appointed governor-general of Fárs, came from the capi-
> tal, Tihrán, to assume the government in Shíráz and was informed of what
> had taken place. He at once collected a considerable military force, which
> he dispatched under the command of Muhammad-ʿAlí Khán Díván-Begí,
> son of Hájí Shukruʾlláh Khán Núrí, and Mustafá-Qulí Khán, commander
of the Qaraguzlú, to subdue and take captive the insurgents.

When this force reached the vicinity of the castle, the number of
> [Vahíd’s] followers had increased to seventy. Several encounters took place
> between the two forces, and on each occasion the friends and companions
> [i.e., the Bábís] routed and dispersed their opponents and obtained pos-
> session of a goodly spoil. And all this while the devotion, faith, and love
> of Vahíd’s companions were much increased by the many victories they
> tasted and the great prodigies he wrought, so that each was fully prepared
> to lay down his life and possessions. He had repeatedly described to his
> companions the circumstances of his own martyrdom, and all had, for
> the good pleasure of the Beloved, washed their hands of life and, quit of
> earthly ties, awaited martyrdom.

Deceiving the Bábís

> Those who had come to take them being unable, notwithstanding all their
> eﬀorts, to prevail by force of arms, and despairing of the ﬁnal issue, opened
> the door of treachery and deceit, and sent a missive before the illustrious
> Vahíd expressing perplexity as to his Cause, making excuses for past deeds,
> declaring themselves desirous of inquiring into the matter, and begging
> for instruction. They further pledged, with oaths sworn upon the Word
> of God [i.e., the Qurʾán], that if he would be good enough to come out
to meet them, they would obey whatever terms he might propose.

So, out of respect for the sacred Qurʾán, which bore their seal, Vahíd

> their wiles, these being in accord with the divinely appointed destiny?
> Because of what they have written and pledged themselves on the Qurʾán

> and took a last farewell of his companions, saying, “Verily, we belong to
> God, and verily unto Him do we return.”106 And his followers wept, a
bitter weeping.

So that honored personage came to the warring camp and there alighted.

> [At ﬁrst] the commanders treated him with all due respect and deference,

[p.130] gone forth from his tent, the sentinels prevented him, saying, “It is not
permitted you to go out.” So he remained a prisoner in the tent.

No sooner had tidings of this reached his faithful followers than,
> unable to restrain themselves, they emerged from their castle, hurled
> themselves upon the center of the army, and, in a short time, threw the
> whole camp into confusion. The senior oﬃcers seeing this, hastened into

> last night that there should be peace and concord?” “Aye,” said he, “but
> your conduct this morning provoked this reprisal.” “It was done without
> our knowledge and approval,” answered they, “and without our sanction.

That honored personage had no recourse but to write to his followers,

Vahíd’s Martyrdom

> There was with the venerable Vahíd a certain believer of Yazd107 who had
> served him faithfully both at Yazd and Nayríz, suﬀering much in the path
> of his master’s good pleasure and attaining the exalted station of servitude
> and true recognition of the Lord by renouncing all earthly possessions.
> And when word was brought that the executioner was on his way from
> the city [i.e., Shíráz] charged with the killing of that illustrious Siyyid
> [Yahyá], this man began to make great lamentation. But his master said,
> “It is you, not me, whom this headsman shall slay; he who shall slay me
will arrive tomorrow.”

When the morrow came, he performed the morning obligatory prayer,
> and an hour later, he said again, “He who is to slay me is now come.”
> Shortly after this, a party of farrashes arrived and led out that honored
> person and the Yazdí from the tent. Then the executioner, just as Vahíd
> had foretold, administered to the youth the draught of martyrdom. When
> his glance fell on that honored person, however, he said, “I am ashamed
> before the face of God’s Messenger and will never lift my hand to slay
> His oﬀspring,” neither would he, for all their importuning, consent to
do their bidding.

Then one who had lost two brothers in the earlier part of the war, and
therefore cherished a deep resentment, said, “I will kill him.” And he

Captives Taken to Shíráz

And they sent an announcement of their victory and triumph to Prince
[p.135] Farhád [sic] Mírzá, and ﬁxed a day for their entry into Shíráz. And when

head-man and chief of the Basírí109 [tribe of Shíráz]:110

> After they had slain that honored person [i.e., Vahíd], they came to take

> feasting and making merry with wanton women. On every side I noted with
> wonder drunken brawls, wine imbibing, the savor of roasted meats, and the
strains of guitars and lutes. Thus wondering I entered the city.

After a while, unable to endure the suspense, I determined to go out of

Parenthetically, Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh notes: The severed head of the illustrious Vahíd was
buried at the foundation of a blessed spot formerly known as Siyyid.

Thus they brought the illustrious captives into the bazaars, which had

> Navváb Prince was holding a pleasure-party in Kuláh Farangí112 and the
> garden adjoining it, he sitting on a chair, and the nobles and magnates of

> recounted their exploits and their glorious victory, with various versions and
> many embellishments, to the Qájár Prince, who on his part kept inquiring
> as to the names and family of the captives, and throwing in an occasional,
> “Who is this?” and “Which is that?” And all the captives were women, with
the exception of one child ﬁve years of age who was with them.

After that, those illustrious beings were excused from the presence [of the
> Prince] and housed outside of the city in a ruined caravansary that dated
> back to the time of Karím Khán Zand.

> On the same night when the raid had been made on the houses of the

Second Nayríz Episode

> volunteers from far and near had been gathered against them, and con-
> sequently those wronged-ones were compelled to commence warfare.
> Hemmed in as they were, that wronged-band began defenses and won
> many gallant victories despite the fewness of their numbers. This struggle
and the siege of the mountain from all directions lasted for a long time.

Often would a company of seven or nineteen men come down from the
> mountain with cries of “Yá Sahibuʾz-Zamán!” attack a battery, cut down
> the gunners, capture the gun, and bear it away with them to the moun-
> tain, where they would mount it on a tree trunk and ﬁre it morning and
> evening against the camp. At other times they would make night-attacks
> on certain suburbs of Nayríz inhabited by enemies and opponents, and
> return safely. [At such times] none could withstand them, nor do aught
but choose between submission and ﬂight.

Now Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín Khán, the governor of Nayríz, had taken the chief
> part in bringing about all these troubles. He it was who had compassed
> the death of the much-wronged Áqá Siyyid Yahyá in the ﬁrst war; he it
> was who devised most of the stratagems, tactics, dispositions, and arrange-
> ments of the army; he it was who, both in the ﬁrst and the second war,
> provoked strife for the sake of securing his position as governor and win-
> ning approval from the government; he it was, in short, who had driven
> away [the Bábís] from their homes and possessions, and caused them
> with their wives and families to be beleaguered in the mountains. So one
> day when this honorable governor had gone to the bath, the illustrious
insurgents attacked the bath and slew him.113

But reinforcements of men and artillery sent in rapid succession by the
> Navváb Tahmasp Mírzá, the Muʿayyaduʾd-Dawlih, who at that time was
> the governor-general of Fárs, continued to arrive from Shíráz and occupy
> the rising ground adjoining the mountain. Still, notwithstanding the great-
> ness of their host, they did not have the courage to face the defenders or
> venture to ascend the mountain in an attack. Even in their camp they
> were ill at ease because of the night-attacks and sudden onslaughts made
> upon them by very small parties of the friends [i.e., the Bábís]. These,
> as was related, would oft-times rush into the camp, attack the artillery,
> slay the gunners, and return, pushing the guns with their shoulders, until

tribesmen, and others. These ascended the mountain on every side.

> with them their prisoners, and the severed heads of the men, set out for
Shíráz, which in due course they reached.

CHAPTER SIX

THE HOUSEHOLD OF HUJJAT

> After a while, consistent with the instruction of the Qájár sovereign, [p.145:10]
> the captives of Zanjan, that is, the household of the illustrious Akhúnd
> Mullá Muhammad-ʿAlí Zanjání, [surnamed] Hujjat,117 who were previ-
> ously destined for Tihrán, were now ordered to be sent to Shíráz. Bíbí
> Ruqiyyih, the eldest daughter of the illustrious Hujjat, related the details
of this episode for this servant thus:

> After thirteen months during which the much-wronged party [i.e., the Bábís]
> had battled the government’s army, one morning Hujjat summoned his entire
> household into his presence. These included his three wives, two of whom
> were permanent, while one was contracted,118 and she did not have a child.
> One of the permanent wives was our mother who had six children, that
> is, ﬁve daughters and a son: Bíbí Ruqiyyih, Bíbí Sarih, Bíbí Fátimih, Bíbí
> Saﬃyih, Bíbí Hamidiyh, and Mírzá Husayn. The other permanent wife had
> a two-year-old son named Ahmad119 who was held closely at his mother’s
> bosom. We all attained our father’s presence where we were exhorted with
words to this eﬀect:

> You must endeavor to distinguish yourselves over the other people and
> in no wise should you be like the rest. You must possess chastity, purity,
> piety, detachment, religion, and trustworthiness. Your deeds must bear
> witness to the nobility of being a believer and a companion of the Qáʾim.
> Should your conduct be such that the One Exalted God will be well
> pleased with you, my spirit will also rejoice and be glad. My martyrdom
> is certain. They will martyr me. After me, each of you many choose either
> martyrdom or captivity, and the Lord will assuredly grant your desire.

He spoke at length in this manner. The younger wife who had an infant
> child replied, “I wish martyrdom so that in whichever of God’s worlds
> you dwell, I would be with you.” He replied, “Since you desire and aspire
> martyrdom, be conﬁdent that such will be your destiny.”

Lit., The Proof, one of the formal titles of the Báb. Toward the latter part of His
> life, the Báb bestowed some of His own titles on His chief disciples. For instance, in 1848
He bestowed the title of “Hadrat-i Aʿlá” (His Holiness the Exalted One) on Quddús.

Islamic jurisprudence allows for four permanent wives and any number of concu-
bines. The latter do not typically enjoy the same status as the former.

Nabíl Aʿzam, The Dawn-Breakers, p. 578, gives his name as Mihdí and suggests
that he died in Shíráz.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 61                                                                                    7/10/2008 3:45:13 PM

Our mother made reply, “Captivity has a greater station since the House-
> hold of the Prophet, that is, the wife and the descendants of the Prince
> of Martyrs [i.e., Imám Husayn] were seized and taken from town to town
> and land to land, and, therefore, I desire enslavement.” “Imprisonment is
> decreed as your fortune and that of your children,” Hujjat answered. He
> then added, “Today is my last day in this transient world. I ask that after
> my martyrdom, you bury me in my clothes by the threshold of this room
and place all your reliance in the Divine Sovereignty.”

After his utterances concluded, a cannonball shot by the enemies broke
> through the room and instantly martyred the younger wife and the child at
> her bosom. Hujjat instructed that she and her infant be buried at the same
> spot. Shortly thereafter, another bullet came through and took his own life.
> In accordance with his instructions, the companions interred his remains
> by the room’s entrance. When the enemies learned that his holiness [Huj-
> jat] was martyred, they surrounded the camp and seized all the remaining
> followers. Then they searched for his body. Finding the spot where he had
[p.150]         been buried, they exhumed the remains and, cutting oﬀ his ﬁnger, removed
a ring he wore.120

Thereafter, they apprehended all of us—a group that consisted of ﬁve
> sisters and my brother, together with our mother and our father’s concubine
> wife—and plundered all our possessions and seized our properties. Having
> completed these, they readied camels previously belonging to our family, and,
> accompanied by caravan-masters, they compelled us to mount the camels. In
> utmost misery, we were conducted in such wise from Zanjan to Tihrán.

> Upon arrival at Tihrán, the Qájár monarch was informed of the manner
> in which they were made captive and conducted to the capital. The Sháh
> ordered that the prisoners must not remain in Tihrán but instead panniers
> be prepared for their delivery to Fárs in a digniﬁed and beﬁtting manner.
> Subsequent to the Sháh’s command, panniers with exquisite covers were
> readied and several attendants assigned to their service. In this manner
> they were conducted to Shíráz.

Arrival in Shíráz

> Upon arrival, they were housed outside the city limits in a caravansary
> constructed by the late Karím Khán Zand, known by the name of Sháh
> Mír ʿAlí-Hamzih. After two days, in accordance with the instructions

Hamadání, Táríkh-i Jadíd, p. 162, notes that anticipating this eventuality, Hujjat
> had stated, “Suﬀer no one to remove the diamond ring which I wear on my hand.” Being

> did that of Husayn ibn ʿAlí ere they can take the ring.”

Time passed and the daughters of Hujjat reached the age of maturity and

The Journey of Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim

He passed away in 1885. See Bámdád, Sharh Hál Rijál Iran, vol. 1, pp. 39–40.

CHAPTER SEVEN

CONVERSION OF THE FAMILY OF THE BÁB

> After the martyrdom of His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb]—may [p.153:7]
> the spirit of all else be a sacriﬁce unto Him—and subsequent to the events
> and troubles of Tihrán, which surely have been recorded in the history
> of that city, on the ﬁfth day of Jamáduʾl-Avval AH 1269 [14 February
> 1853],127 the Blessed Perfection [Baháʾuʾlláh]—exalted be His mention and
> praise—arrived at the Abode of Peace [i.e., Baghdad]. Through trusted
> emissaries, He commenced sending mighty Tablets to various parts and
> corners of Iran bearing His sacred insignia, 152, which is the number
> of Bahá.128

Conversion of Núriʾd-Dín

> One such Tablet was revealed in honor of the exalted leaf [Khadíjih
> Bagum], the wife of His Holiness the Exalted One, in Fárs. At that time,
> no one in the Afnán family was among the believers, and consequently
> none were in the conﬁdence of the illustrious wife [of the Báb]. As such,
> she began to speak and teach the present writer’s father, Áqá Mírzá Áqá
> Afnán,129 whom the Ancient Beauty in a splendid Tablet designated thus:
> “We have named thee at this moment, Núriʾd-Dín [the light of ].”130

Shoghi Eﬀendi, God Passes By, p. 109, and Balyúzí, Baháʾuʾlláh the King of Glory,
p. 106, state that Baháʾuʾlláh arrived in Baghdad on 8 April 1853.

According to the abjad system, the numerical values of the three letters composing
the word Bahá (B, H, and A) are 2, 5, and 1, respectively.

For a biography see, Balyúzí, Eminent Baháʾís in the Time of Baháʾuʾlláh, pp. 216–36.

For ease of reference, the entire Tablet is provided below and is a slight modiﬁcation

(original Text in INBMC 51:323, no. 326, and Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, p. 201):

> Afnán. The honored Mírzá Áqá, upon him rest the Glory of God!
He is God, exalted is He, the Lord of Majesty and Grandeur.

> O My Afnán! Upon thee rest My Glory, My Bounty, and My Favor.

Verily, the Servant-in-Attendance [i.e., Mírzá Áqá Ján, Baháʾuʾlláh’s amanuensis]
> came and made mention of thee in Our presence. We therefore extolled thee in such
> wise as to cause the cities of remembrance and utterance to be set ablaze. Verily, thy
> Lord is the Supreme Ruler over all things. We have named thee at this moment,

At that time Núriʾd-Dín was thirteen131 years of age and was her nephew.

> They engaged in discussion about the Cause, and shortly thereafter he
> embraced the Faith. The sacred breath of the illustrious wife [of the
> Báb] penetrated his being in such wise that even from a young age he
> was consumed with profound zeal and devotion, and was uncontrollably
[p.155] propelled to teach the Faith with utmost courage and audacity.

Initially, he taught [the new Theophany to] his own father, Áqá Mírzá
> Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín, who was close to the late Áqá Mír Muhammad-Ridá,
> the Báb’s father, and was his paternal cousin. Having eﬀected the spiritual
> conversion of his father, he turned his attention to his mother, [Zahrá
> Bagum], as she was a sister of the wife [Khadíjih Bagum], and she gave
> submission to the new religion as well. Thus his condition was eased
within his immediate household.

My late father forwarded supplications to the sanctiﬁed presence [of
> Baháʾuʾlláh] in the Abode of Peace, and in response was honored with
> mighty Tablets in the sacred hand of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá. These Tablets are
> currently kept in a special container. Divine benevolence thus embraced
him.132

At that time, two requests for attainment unto His sanctiﬁed pres-
> ence were sent [to Baháʾuʾlláh]: one from my late father, Áqá Mírzá Áqá
> Núriʾd-Dín, and the other from his father, the late Áqá Mírzá Zaynuʾl-
> ʿAbidín. In response, two separate wondrous and hallowed Tablets in the
> blessed hand of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá were revealed [by Baháʾuʾlláh]. In reply to
> the late Áqá Mírzá Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín’s request, after bestowing great favors
> upon him, it was written, “Thou hast requested permission to attain Our
> presence. Before this Tablet reacheth thee, thou wilt have reached Us.”133

And in response to my late father’s missive, again after showering him

> Núriʾd-Dín. We beseech God that He may ordain for thee that which will draw
> thee nigh unto Him and be of proﬁt to thee. He, verily, is the All-Gracious, the
All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

My aﬀection rest upon thee and those that are with thee who hear thy voice in
this mighty Cause.

The original text states “eleven,” however, someone, possibly the author, has crossed
> it out and written “thirteen” over it. Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúruʾl-Haqq, vol. 6, p. 856,
> gives Núriʾd-Dín’s age at the time of conversion as 11 years old. Since the latter source
> has heavily relied on Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh’s account for its information on Fárs, it suggests
that Fádil Mázandarání had an early copy of this manuscript in his possession.

As described in the preface, at ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s bidding, Núriʾd-Dín prepared a col-
> lection of Baháʾuʾlláh’s Tablets revealed in his honor and sent a copy to the Holy Land.
This densely written compilation is more than 161 pages long.

> with immense bounties, it was revealed in Arabic, “Thou hast requested
> permission to come before Us, but know that thou wilt be honored with
this in the course of the next Manifestation.”134

By the time that these sacred Tablets were received, Áqá Mírzá Zaynuʾl-
> ʿAbidín had passed away, and the meaning of His sanctiﬁed Person [i.e.,
> Baháʾuʾlláh] became evident and clear, as he had reached the Beloved
> before the Tablet had reached him. My late father, however, would often
> remark that he was most puzzled by the statement, “. . . in the course of
> the next Manifestation” he would attain the presence.135

Conversion of the Great Uncle of the Báb

> After having conﬁrmed his parents, my father commenced discussion with
> the illustrious Khál, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad. One day a group of
> the friends were in his [Núriʾd-Dín’s] presence, and my brothers and this
> servant were in attendance as well, and he thus recalled his discussions
with the honored Khál:

> At the beginning when I broached the subject with the illustrious Khál, he
> would persistently refuse, and yet I would put forth more evidences and
> proofs [in support of the Báb’s claim]. It proceeded in such wise for several
meetings.136

One day in the course of our discussion I was strenuously enumerating
> proofs when, with great amazement, he exclaimed, “Áqá Mírzá Áqá, are
> you saying that my Nephew is the Qáʾim of the House of Muhammad?”
> “And what if He is?” I responded. Thoroughly astounded, he rejoiced,
> “That would be most extraordinary,” to which I replied, “There is nothing
strange about it!”

[From this comment,] he became most reﬂective. Considering his condi-
> tion, I smiled. He asked, “Why do you laugh?” At ﬁrst, I refused to answer
> and replied, “It might not be polite on my part, and therefore it is best for
> me not to say.” However, he insisted, “Do not be reticent and say [what
> you are thinking].” “Now that you wish,” I responded, “I will share. The
> objection that your exalted self now raised is the very one that Abu-Lahab137

Núriʾd-Dín attained the presence of Baháʾuʾlláh after His Declaration and the
inauguration of the Baháʾí Faith.

Letters of the Khál Akbar written upon the Báb’s return from the hajj journey and
> arrival in Búshihr indicate that by May 1845 he had already become a believer, though
> it is likely that he thought the Báb was only a representative of the Hidden Imám; see

An uncle of Muhammad who rejected and opposed His Mission.

> be proud! Do not be perplexed, and do not separate yourself therefrom.
> The Almighty is well able to have appointed your Nephew as the Qáʾim of
the House of Muhammad. ‘The Hand of God is free.’ ”

Then, the honored Khál responded, “The light of mine eye! What an
> irrefutable answer! There is no further room for objection. What am I to
> do now?” I said to him, “This is what you ought to do: First, it is obliga-
> tory upon you to go on pretext of pilgrimage to the ʿAtabát and there to
> visit your exalted sister, (namely, the mother of His Holiness [the Báb], as
> after the news of the Martyrdom she proceeded to the ʿAtabát and resided
> there). Second, Íshán (that is, the Blessed Beauty) now resides in Baghdad,
> and it behooves you to journey there for a few days and to inquire of your
[p.160]               perplexities. You must exert yourself and place your reliance in God. I

> hope that the veils will be lifted and certitude will be attained. ‘Man can
> have nothing but what he strives for.’ ”138 After hearing these remarks, he
responded, “Not a bad idea. Your words have penetrated my heart.”139

He wrote his [youngest] brother, Hájí Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí, who at that
> time was a merchant in Yazd, “I intend to visit the ʿAtabát and meet our
> exalted sister. Should you wish to join in, come to Shíráz so we may journey
> together.” On seeing his brother’s letter, Hájí Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí wrote, “I
> stand ready to join you on this pilgrimage. Kindly remain in Shíráz until
my arrival, and thereupon we will travel to the ʿAtabát.”

Therefore, the honored Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad commenced
> preparation for the journey and awaited the arrival of Hájí Mírzá Hasan-
> ʿAlí. A month later, the Hájí arrived in Shíráz, and together they set out
> for Búshihr and the ʿAtabát. En route, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad did
> not divulge the true object of their quest to his brother and instead waited
> until they arrived at the Abode of Peace.140 In Baghdad, he informed Hájí
> Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí, “The principle objective of this journey from Shíráz was
> to make a religious inquiry and investigation, and only secondarily did I
> wish to visit our sister in the ʿAtabát. With your consent, we will tarry for a
> while in Baghdad and meet with His Holiness Íshán [Baháʾuʾlláh], and after
> having completed our investigation, we will then proceed to the ʿAtabát.”

place in Kazimiyn.

> and have no wish to hear of such discussions.” That very day, Hájí Mírzá
Hasan-ʿAlí departed [from Baghdad].

The esteemed Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad remained behind and tried
> to meet with the venerable Hájí Siyyid Javád Karbaláʾí, whose good name
> was mentioned earlier in this history. Upon their encounter, he informed the
> latter, “The purpose of my journey to the Abode of Peace is to meet with
> His Holiness Íshán and make certain religious inquiries. As you are known
> to His blessed Person and attain His presence, kindly request permission and
> ask for an appointment [that I may gain His presence].” In light of their
> long friendship and association, the honored Hájí Siyyid Javád, who was at
> that time a believer and conﬁrmed, was deeply moved with the Khál’s stated
purpose and expressed his profound joy and felicitation over this matter.

Thereupon, he attained the presence of the Blessed Beauty and stated, “The
> honored Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad, the second Khál of His Holiness
> the Exalted One [the Báb]—may the spirit of all else be a sacriﬁce unto
> Him—has come from Shíráz to the Abode of Peace and wishes to gain the
> bliss of Your presence. Would permission be granted?” Out of divine favor
> and grace, [Baháʾuʾlláh] expressed His joy and ﬁxed the hour of the meeting
and granted permission.

At the appointed time, together with Hájí Siyyid Javád, he [the uncle
> of the Báb] attained His presence and was surrounded with His immense
> blessing, at which time he shared his understanding regarding the issue of
> the appearance of the Qáʾim, the prophecies [associated with this event],
> and certain other matters that expressed his deeply held convictions. In
> response, some of these diﬃculties were addressed [by Baháʾuʾlláh], but
> then, as a grace upon all, He said, “Commit to paper all that you have in
> mind about such propositions so that suﬃcient and convincing response
will be written as well.”

On hearing this, the honored Khál was exceedingly happy because of
> His benevolence and that very night wrote in detail the complex questions
> he had in mind regarding the appearance and the proofs of the promised
> Qáʾim and presented these queries.141

> In response, the sacred Kitáb-i Íqán was revealed in the honor of the Khál
> and bestowed upon him, and at that time was known as the [Risalih-i] [p.165]
> Khálawiyyih [i.e., The Treatise for the Uncle].142 That very copy of the
> Kitáb-i Íqán was seen by this servant in the possession of the illustrious
> Khál’s daughter, namely, the mother of the late Hájí Mírzá ʿAlí<54>.

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh provides the following marginal note in his own hand:

Khál’s Return to Shíráz

> The friends came to meet the illustrious Khál and to receive spiritual
sustenance from him. The late Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán related:

> Upon attaining the presence of the Khál, with the greatest aﬀection he
> welcomed me and expressed his immense gratitude by saying, “My son!

> Abode of Peace and would have failed in attaining the station of certitude,
> which is the utmost desire of them that seek nearness to God.” He then
prayed for me from the depths of his heart.

I asked, “Kindly grant me permission to speak also with your honored sons
> [so they too might ﬁnd their way to the Faith of the Báb].” “Yea, speak with

All other sources, including Baháʾuʾlláh’s own testimony, agree however that His

Nabíl’s own travel diary indicates that he arrived in Shíráz from Ardistán. A summary
> of Nabíl’s travels from the time of Baháʾuʾlláh’s Declaration in April 1863 until Nabíl’s

> sent to teach the Cause in ‘Iraq and Iran. He eventually reached Baghdad by Naw-Rúz
> of 1864, then traveled in the western and central parts of Iran, and eventually returned

of 1866 (See Vahid Raʾfati, “Nabíl Aʿzam Zarandí,” 5:33–36).

Before anything else, as bidden by Baháʾuʾlláh, Nabíl preformed the rites of the
> obligatory pilgrimage (hajj). Nabíl knew the Afnán family from his visit in 1279 AH/1862
> when he had arrived in time for the marriage of Mírzá Buzurg<15> (Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán,
private communications, August 1994).

Better known as Kilíd-Dár [the key-keeper or the caretaker] he had been the cus-
todian of Sháh-Chiráq.

> Tablets and Writings. After partaking of tea, the venerable Nabíl gathered
> all the Writings and read each with great care. All the papers and Tablets
were separated into three stacks and set apart from each other.

Nabíl then announced, “The ﬁrst group are the Tablets of His Holiness
> the Exalted One [the Báb]—may the spirit of all else be a sacriﬁce unto
> Him.” He placed these on the ﬂoor and picked up another batch, saying,
> “These are the Writings of ‘Him Whom God shall make manifest’—may
> His mention be exalted—the very Person whose Advent was promised by
> His Holiness the Exalted One to the concourse of the Bayán, making the
> acceptance or rejection of all that He had revealed dependent upon His
> good pleasure. With greatest clarity, He established a Covenant, declaring,
> ‘O people of the Bayán! Be vigilant, for the appearance of Him Whom
> God shall manifest is nigh. Beware lest the Bayán and all that is therein
> may shut you out from His Manifestation.’ ‘The Bayán is but a leaf before
> Him. Were He to deign accept it, it would be of His grace. And were He
> to reject it, it would be but a sign of His justice.’ In another passage, the
> time of His blessed appearance was ﬁxed with precision, ‘In the year nine
> ye will attain unto all good.’150 ‘He will proclaim His Cause and invite all
> the people and the followers of the Bayán to the ridván of the His divine
> recognition. Whosoever accepts Him, is reckoned among the dwellers of
> paradise. And whosoever rejects Him, is of the people of hellﬁre and by
> ﬁre they shall perish.’ This third group are the polemic papers151 and are
> unworthy of consideration.” He then picked up the third group of papers
and threw them into the stove where a ﬁre was burning.

[Upon this pronouncement,] a tumult was stirred among the friends. For
> instance, greatly agitated, the honored Khál, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad,
> vociferously protested, “What manner of scheme is this? What sort of talks
> are these? Do you take faith to be like a weed; you cut it in daytime, and
> it grows again during the night?” In similar manner, many objected [to
what Nabíl had advanced].

It was then that I [intervened and] spoke calmly to the Khál, stating,
> “Of a certainty, we must investigate and determine the actual truth of the
> situation. A mighty claim such as this must surely be true, for none save
> the True One has the temerity to advance such an assertion. Consider the
> time when His Holiness the Exalted One—gloriﬁed be His mention—was
> in Shíráz and proclaimed His divine mission. Was He not the Truth, and
> was He not sent by the One Exalted God to guide mankind? How was
> it, then, that everyone rejected Him, vast multitudes rose in opposition to

Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúruʾl-Haqq, vol. 6, p. 857, suggests the writings of Azal
were meant.

After hearing such reasoning, the illustrious Khál grew reﬂective and
> responded, “We must thoroughly investigate this matter, as religion is not
a trivial matter.”

In this way, on that day, the dispute among the believers was reduced,
and the esteemed Nabíl was able to proceed towards Isfahán.

Opposition of Shaykh Muhammad

My father further related:

> There was a certain Shaykh Muhammad Yazdí in Shíráz who was a believer in
> His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb] and prior to the Declaration of the
> Blessed Beauty would always say, “The Promised One of the Bayán, namely,
> ‘Him Whom God shall manifest,’ can be none other than Baháʾuʾlláh.” The
[p.175]         believers were particularly disturbed with such talk and were determined to

> harm him in some way. Often, they would come to me, complaining, “Please
> allow us to injure Shaykh Muhammad, as it is now only the beginning of the
> Dispensation, and he is raising matters that will cause diﬀerences. Indeed,
> he is planting seeds of division and rancor.” I would admonish them to
> calmness and respond, “It is best for you not to heed such comments and
> to leave him to himself. No one, as yet, has advanced a claim, and Shaykh
> Muhammad is welcome to speak as he wishes.” In short, I would endeavor
to ﬁnd ways to quiet the friends.

It went thus until the honored Nabíl arrived and announced the Cause
> [of Baháʾuʾlláh], and all the believers readily accepted and embraced the
> straight path, except for the aforementioned Shaykh Muhammad who raised
> the standard of hesitation. With great energy he would resist this announce-
> ment and say, “There is no truth to such a claim. The promise of the Bayán

> ‘Mustagháth.’154 The Bayánic Era has not concluded, and the Bayánic laws
> have not been promulgated or implemented. Therefore, how could they be
abrogated [so swiftly]?”

This manner of talk was particularly disagreeable and oﬀensive to the
> friends, and they unanimously resolved to slay Shaykh Muhammad and
> destroy him altogether. They came to me and asked for permission, “Prior
> to [Baháʾuʾlláh’s] Declaration, this man would maintain that the Promised

repudiates the Truth must be chastised.”

The friends were particularly happy with this response and left determined

See, the Persian Bayán 2:17 and 3:15. For a summary translation, consult Momen,

> however, that the Promised One would appear before the expiration of Mustagháth (2001

> oﬀ, O heedless ones, the slumber of negligence, that ye may behold the radiance which
> His glory hath spread through the world. How foolish are those who murmur against the
> premature birth of His light. O ye who are inly blind! Whether too soon or too late, the

> set the time at which it should be made manifest. God’s inscrutable Wisdom hath ﬁxed
its hour beforehand.”

The tone of the original text implies that while, in order to pacify the believers,
> Núriʾd-Dín had consented to the murder of Shaykh Muhammad, yet secretly he had
informed the latter of what was to occur.

Balyúzí, Eminent Baháʾís in the Time of Baháʾuʾlláh, p. 227, states that Shaykh
> Muhammad proceeded to Istanbul where he joined with principal Azalis and caused great
> mischief. A more detailed outline of his activities is provided by Baháʾuʾlláh (INBMC
> 51:524–25, no. 517) where it is noted that together with Yahyá Azal, he committed many
> misdeeds. In a Tablet dated 21 Safar 1307 AH/23 October 1889 to Núriʾd-Dín in Port

Conversion of the Remaining Kinsmen

> After the departure of the honored Nabíl, Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán endeavored
> to teach and proclaim the blessed Cause, and was successful in conﬁrming
> a number of seekers. During this period, he taught his maternal cousins,
> Áqá Siyyid Muhammad-Husayn and Áqá [Siyyid] Mírzá Abúʾl-Hasan, the
> sons of the illustrious Afnán, the late Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim<11>. He
> would take them with him to various meetings and exert much eﬀort in
renewing their spirit.

Some days ago, this servant was in the presence of my distinguished
> maternal uncle, Áqá Siyyid Muhammad-Husayn<37>, and asked him
concerning the way he had found the Faith:

> Repeatedly, your father, the honored Áqá Mírzá Áqá, who was a paternal
> cousin of mine, would speak about this Cause with my brother Áqá Mírzá
> Abúʾl-Hasan and me, and share the Divine Words. He would also take us to
> various gatherings, especially the ones held at the home of Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí-
> Akbar Sábir. We attended several such meetings and heard the Sacred Verses.
> However, as we were of the same age as your father and were related to him,
we did not much heed his eﬀorts, though we would hold our tongues.

After some time, the honored Hájí Muhammad-Ibráhím Yazdí, the
> Muballigh,159 arrived in Shíráz from Yazd. Your father took advantage of
> the opportunity and aligned the venerable Muballigh in this purpose with
> himself, and together they endeavored to teach and edify us. Out of the
> divine grace and through the conﬁrmations from on High, we were able to
> recognize the Truth and embraced the Faith as believers.

> In like manner the whole of the Afnán family in Shíráz accepted the Faith.
Blessings be upon them and may their end be well!

My late father would relate: “During the time that the honored Hájí
Muhammad-Ibráhím tarried in Shíráz and taught the Faith, a large num-

Lit., the deceased ones, a reference to the followers of Yahyá Azal.

The sole exception in Fárs was the community of Hindijan where one of the Bábís,

> In this regard Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán, who would also assist them with
> ﬁnancial support, encouraged them. All meetings and gatherings were
held in the residence of the esteemed Afnán.

In short, after his sojourn in Shíráz, the honored Muballigh returned

> was therefore decided best for him to quit the city. My late father would
relate:

> Several times, I emphasized to the honored Muballigh, “Once you have

> haply they would become believers in the Faith as well.” Since the esteemed
> Hájí Muhammad-Ibráhím was related to our Yazdí family, that is, his sister
> [Hájíyyih Bíbí Gawhar] had married Hájí Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí, a maternal
> uncle of His Holiness the Exalted One—may my spirit be a sacriﬁce unto
Him—he was a conﬁdant to the family.

Upon arrival in Yazd, in accordance with my request, he commenced
> discussions with the Afnán, that is, Hájí Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid
> Hasan, [surnamed] Afnán Kabír, and their sons.161 As the scions were young
> and less fanatical, they hastened to embrace the Faith. However, despite of
> the Muballigh’s eﬀorts, Hájí Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí refused to recognize at that
> time and stated, “I will accept only if Áqá Mírzá Siyyid Hasan, who is our
> superior in the realm of divine knowledge, would also assent and recognize.”
> That is, he allowed the honored Áqá Mírzá Siyyid Hasan to become his
spiritual lens and conditioned his acceptance upon the latter’s.

After the greatest of eﬀorts and troubles, ﬁnally Áqá Mírzá Siyyid Hasan
> accepted the Faith, and immediately thereafter, the honored Khál, Hájí
> Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí, embraced the Cause as well.

> In such wise, none among this distinguished family, whether male or
> female, remained deprived of the blessing of recognition.

For some unexplained reason, Balyúzí, Eminent Baháʾís in the Time of Baháʾuʾlláh,
p. 224, has placed these events some years earlier, closer to 1863.

Balyúzí, Eminent Baháʾís in the Time of Baháʾuʾlláh, p. 229, states that in accordance
> with the instructions of Baháʾuʾlláh, Mullá Muhammad Nabíl Akbar had also arrived in
> Yazd to teach the Baháʾí Faith, and he joined forces with the Muballigh.

During the time that I tarried in Cairo, Egypt, one day the illustrious

CHAPTER EIGHT

FIRST BAHÁʾÍ MARTYRS OF SHÍRÁZ IN 1871

> After the departure of Hájí Muhammad-Ibráhím [Muballigh] from Shíráz, [p.183:11]
> the admired Nabíl Akbar, that is, Mullá Muhammad Qáʾiní, arrived here.
> He stayed for thirteen months in Shíráz, and his residence was the home
> of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán. During this time, he was engaged in teaching
> and serving [the Baháʾí Faith] and was able to convert a large number [of
> seekers to the Baháʾí Faith] and to renew their spirits.162

The Intercession of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk

> Among the incidents that occurred during this period in Shíráz and
> caused disturbance for the friends was the bitter dispute and conﬂict
> between Mírzá Abúʾl-Hasan Khán, the Mushíruʾl-Mulk [II],163 and Mírzá
> ʿAlí-Muhammad Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk [II].164 Since the Mushíruʾl-
> Mulk was a vizier [of the province] and the Qavámuʾl-Mulk performed
> the oﬃces of Kalántar [police] and Biglar-bayki [provincial mayor], the
believers became pawns in their contentions.

The Mushír’s intent was to cause revolt and unrest throughout the realm,
> in the hope that it would engulf [his opponent] the Qavám. In whatever
> town he arrived, the Mushír would compile a list of the believers and [p.185]
> forward it to the governor-general. Further, he would incite the ʿulamá
> and urge them to perpetrate various evils. Several times, he precipitated
such disturbances and injuries.

Eventually, in AH 1283 [1866], during the governorship of Sultán-
Murád Mírzá, the Hisámuʾs-Saltanih,165 he prepared a list of the believers

Balyúzí, Eminent Baháʾís in the Time of Baháʾuʾlláh, p. 229, indicates that Hájí Mírzá
> Abúʾl-Qásim<11> became a believer at this time, thereby completing the conversion of
the Afnán family.

He inherited the title after the passing of his father.

The fourth son of Hájí ʿAlí-Akbar Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk I, he was born in 1829

> and in 1865, after the passing of his father, assumed his title and position. Among the
> projects he supervised was the construction of an aqueduct in 1879 that brought fresh
water to the city. He passed away at the age of 56.

> Shariʿih, to most vigorously pursue these souls.166 The persons [i.e.,
> Baháʾís] who, of every class, were on this list included Hájí Mírzá Siyyid
> Muhammad<5>, the Khál; Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí Afnán<14>; Hájí
> Mírzá Buzurg Afnán<15>; Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán<11>; and Áqá
> Mírzá Áqá Afnán<24>. All ranked as the noblest citizens of Shíráz and
> were among the renowned merchants. [Other believers also on the list
> were] Hájí Abúʾl-Hasan; Mashhadí Abúʾl-Qásim Kharráz [haberdasher];
> Mashhadí167 Nabí Khayyát [tailor]; Mashhadí Muhammad-Jaʿfar Khayyát;
> Áqá Mírzá Áqá Rikáb-Sáz [treadle-maker]; Karbaláʾí Muhammad-Háshim
> Qassáb [butcher]; Áqá Mullá ʿAbduʾl-lláh Zarqání, whom the Abhá Pen
> had surnamed “Rafíʿ Badíʿ”;168 Mullá ʿAbduʾlláh Biká’; and a number of
others.

This list was given [by the Mushír] to the Qájár Prince Hisámu’s-
> Saltanih, who upon reviewing the recorded names, summoned Mírzá
> ʿAlí-Muhammad Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk, and with great vehemence,
> admonished him, “For several years now you have been given a position
> of service in the everlasting [central] government. And yet, you do not
> administer in the best interest of the government since the number of
> the traitorous elements [i.e., Baháʾís] has grown to very many in the city!
> Why have you not on your own initiative reported the matter to us so
> that we would order their complete eradication? The ﬁrst and foremost
> command of the everlasting government to the governors and oﬃcers is
> destruction of the enemies of the exalted Qájár crown and throne, and
> extermination of the ﬁlth of their person from the realm. Most assuredly
> and of a certainty, I expect these men [on the list] to be brought before
me by tomorrow.”

Noting the fury of the Prince, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk had remained silent
> for a few moments. The taciturnity of the latter added to the anger of the
> Prince who had spoken most abrasively to the Qavám. Eventually, the
> Qavámuʾl-Mulk stated, “Your exalted self should enjoy a water-pipe while

Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúruʾl-Haqq, vol. 6, pp. 859–60, gives his name as Muham-
mad, which most likely is a misreading of “Mashhadí.”

For one instance of such designation, see Baháʾuʾlláh’s Tablet to Núriʾd-Dín in Port

> explain in detail the character of these personages and to introduce them
properly.” “Proceed without any hesitation,” the Prince replied.

The Qavámuʾl-Mulk responded, “First, these people who have been

> “Introduce them more fully so that we would be better informed of their
condition,” the Prince ordered.

The Qavám then commenced to tell of each in more detail, “Hájí Mírzá
> Siyyid Muhammad<5> is a merchant, and Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí
> and Hájí Mírzá Buzurg are his two sons. Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim Saqá-

On hearing the Qavámuʾl-Mulk speak thus and learning of the back-

Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim was a very wealthy merchant.

The Imprisonment of Believers

> For a while such talk subsided, until a second event occurred causing once
> again the ﬁre of hostility to glow brightly. The following description of that
event is based on what my father, Áqá Mírzá Áqá [Núriʾd-Dín], related:

> The wife of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Rikáb-Sáz170 was a particularly rancorous and
> spiteful woman. The more that wronged-one tried to edify his wife and
> instill certitude in her, the less eﬀect it had, and day-by-day she grew in
> enmity and hostility. He did not wish to divorce her because they had a
> child—a lad named Mírzá Nasruʾlláh—whom he cherished fondly. No words
> of admonishment bore any fruits or had any eﬀect on her. Eventually, the
> evildoers171 provoked this woman into going before Shaykh Husayn Zálim
> and informing him, “My husband is a Bábí, and each day congregates with
> other Bábís and has regular meetings. [For this reason,] I no longer wish
to live in his home.”

Shaykh Husayn knew [her husband] Áqá Mírzá Áqá, as he had acted with
> wisdom, pretending to be among the foremost devotees of the Shaykh even
> to the point that at the mosque Áqá Mírzá Áqá would spread the prayer-
> mat for the Shaykh and wait upon him. Because of his conﬁdence in him,
> at ﬁrst the Shaykh refused to believe the woman and spoke most sternly,
> “You are a liar, as Áqá Mírzá Áqá is among my conﬁdants.” In this manner,
he sent the woman away.

Certain righteous men, who had witnessed this discussion with the
> Shaykh, reported the matter to that gentle soul, saying, “Be vigilant, as
> your wife has gone before the Shaykh registering such complaints against
> you. For now, the latter has admonished her and dismissed her protest.
> However, if you have certain Writings in your home, it is best to remove
them immediately as he might follow through with an investigation.”

Áqá Mírzá Áqá had a pleasant Naskh style of calligraphy and often made
> copies of the Kitáb-i Íqán.172 He, however, paid no attention to their warn-
> ings, and the believers noting him to be heedless of their alerts, reported

Nabíl Aʿzam, The Dawn-Breakers, p. 156, states that he became a believer in the
> Báb on the occasion of His proclamation in the Masjid Vakíl. Later he traveled to Bagh-
> dad and attained the presence of Baháʾuʾlláh, and in answer to his questions, a Tablet
> in exposition of the Disconnected Letters of the Qurʾán, and the meaning of the Light
Verse was revealed.

Presumably, a reference to the Mushíruʾl-Mulk.

> the matter to me and explained the situation. I requested Áqá Mírzá Áqá to
> come visit and then exhorted him to remove the Writings from his home
> and to deal with his wife in a way not to provoke her, as she might cause
mischief.

Nevertheless, after a few days, the wife had yet again gone before the
> Shaykh and cried out for intervention. This time the Shaykh, however, had
> remained silent. The mischief-makers, who had been at the Shaykh’s lecture,
> had spoken supportive of that shameless woman, and she, encouraged by
> ﬁnding a number championing her, had exclaimed, “O honored Shaykh!
> How can you allow my husband to be home at this hour busy with tran-
> scribing the Bábí books?” The Shaykh had become perplexed and stated,
> “If it is as you describe and you speak the truth, then with my own hands
I shall slay Mírzá Áqá!”

In their midst was a person who was secretly a believer. He had quickly
> left the gathering and reported the situation to me, thus, “A group of [p.195]
> troublemakers will shortly attack the home of Áqá Mírzá Áqá and will seize
> him and the Writings [in his possession] and will take them to the presence
> of the Shaykh.” I said to Nanih Maʿsumih, who [in former days] had been
> one of the Nayrízi captives and had remained behind in Shíráz working in
> our home, “Quickly proceed to Áqá Mírzá Áqá’s residence and inform him
> of the details, and bring with you any Writings he may have. It is very likely
> that the mob will attack his house and will conﬁscate the Writings for the
Shaykh. Make great haste to Áqá Mírzá Áqá!”

Nanih Maʿsumih had put on her chador and briskly made her way to
> the home of Áqá Mírzá Áqá and observed him to be serenely engaged in
> transcribing [Baháʾí Writings]. She apprised him of situation. However, in
> refusing her request, the latter stated, “These are just idle talks. Shaykh
> Husayn has the utmost conﬁdence in me.” [Nanih Maʿsumih] insisted, “It
> is far worse than you think! Rise and gather the Writings!” The honored Áqá
> Mírzá Áqá, however, procrastinated. Considering the urgency of the situation
> and Áqá Mírzá Áqá’s reluctance to heed her counsel, Nanih Maʿsumih had
> seized the box of the Writings placed before her host, and hiding it under
her chador, quickly walked out.

Stepping into the street, she heard the clamor of the mob approaching
> in haste and great fury, led by a number of the Akhúnds and the wife of
> that wronged-one. Hiding herself for the crowd to pass, the brave Nanih
Maʿsumih brought the box to me and informed me of the details.

Meanwhile, the crowd of myrmidons rushed into the house only to ﬁnd
> Áqá Mírzá Áqá sitting alone, enjoying a water-pipe. The wife entered the
> dwelling to seize the box of the Writings for the Akhúnds to take to the
> Shaykh, but was unable to ﬁnd it. Despite their thorough search, she and

> Shaykh accusing you of being a Bábí, and indeed a transcriber of their
> Writings.” Since he was conﬁdent that no Writings were left in his house,
> Áqá Mírzá Áqá replied, “As no trace of any illicit materials are found in my
home, it is most evident that my wife’s allegation is false!”

The Akhúnds admonished the woman, “Where are the materials you
> alleged to the honored Áqá [i.e., the Shaykh]? It is clear that you are a liar!”
> The woman had cried out, “By God, when I left the house this morning to
> attain the presence of Áqá, this apostate was engaged in transcribing. I do
> not lie.” The Akhúnds insisted, “If you speak the truth, then where are the
> Writings and the Books?” “Perhaps they have been taken by the ghosts,”
said the woman, “as Mírzá Áqá controls the ghouls too!”

[Notwithstanding their lack of ﬁndings,] Áqá Mírzá Áqá was taken by
> the mob to Shaykh Husayn Zálim who reproached him bluntly, but that
> wronged-one maintained his silence. The Shaykh insisted, “Mírzá Áqá, how
> do you respond to your wife’s claim that you are a Bábí?” “This woman is
> a liar,” Mírzá Áqá replied, “as she had alleged that I was a Bábí and a tran-
> scriber of their Writings, while in spite of their thorough search, none were
> found in my home. Had they found any, then it would have substantiated
> her statement. Therefore, it is evident that she harbors false resentments and
[p.200]         speaks disparagingly.” The Shaykh responded, “If she is a liar and you are

> not a Bábí, then you must curse them forthwith.” “I do not know them,
> and as such how can I curse people not known to me?” That tyrannical man
> [i.e., Shaykh Zálim] then named both His Holiness the Exalted One [the
> Báb] and the Blessed Perfection, and gave their particulars and instructed
> his victim to deprecate and denounce Both. On further refusing to comply
> with his persistently stated command, the Shaykh determined, “Indeed, it
is apparent that your wife has spoken the truth.”

Thereupon, he proceeded to administer punishments with his own hands
> on the accused and afterwards wrote a report to the governor, and imprisoned
that esteemed personage [Áqá Mírzá Áqá].

The following day, an enormous uproar engulfed the city, and again the
> Mushíruʾl-Mulk prepared a long list of names, giving it to the Hisámuʾs-
> Saltinih, claiming that they were all Bábís, deserving castigation and per-
secution.

The Prince summoned the Qavámuʾl-Mulk, handed him the list and stated,
> “You are to bring these men before me.” The Qavámuʾl-Mulk sensed that
> this time [the Navváb] was determined to see the matter through and that
> no intervention would help. Greatly perturbed, he instructed his farrashes
and the Dárúghih to apprehend the named men.

By that afternoon, the following were arrested and brought before the
> Qájár Prince: Áqá Mírzá Áqá Rikáb-Sáz; Mashhadí Nabí; Mashhadí Muham-
> mad-Jaʿfar Khayyát; Hájí Abúʾl-Hasan [Bazzáz]; Karbaláʾí Muhammad-
> Háshim; Mashhadí Abúʾl-Qásim Kharráz; Karbaláʾí Hasan Khán Sarvistání;
> Áqá Mírzá Báqir; Áqá Mullá ʿAbduʾlláh, the Fádil [Zarqání]; Áqá Mullá
> ʿAbduʾlláh Biká’; and a number of others. These men were assembled before
> [the Prince] Sultán-Murád Mírzá who instructed that they be chained and
> fettered in the dungeon.

[With the spread of this news] a great commotion was raised throughout
> the city. The thugs and ribald elements were now unrestrained to speak most
> vehemently [against the Baháʾí Faith] and perpetrate mischief. Anyone that
> harbored a grievance against another used the occasion to exact his wish.

No manner of antagonism was avoided.

The Release of Two Prisoners

> After a few days, the Qájár Prince ordered the wronged believers brought
> into his presence in his palace. At ﬁrst the honored Mullá ʿAbduʾlláh Fádil,
> [surnamed] Rafíʿ-Badíʿ, was brought forward. Both the Mushíruʾl-Mulk and
> the Qavámuʾl-Mulk were in attendance as well. The Mushír had a particular
> aﬃnity towards Fádil and did not wish to see him entangled in diﬃculties.
> The Prince addressed the prisoner, “O Akhúnd! They say that you are a
> Bábí!” “What am I to say?” the honored Fádil replied, “I pray that no one
> suﬀers such a day of troubles. Everyone has competitors in his own ﬁeld
> and domain. Even we rawdih-kháns have much rivalry among ourselves.
> Since my profession is rawdih-khání, many people in Fárs, particularly the
> aﬄuent citizens, are fond of my services, and this has precipitated jealousy
> among other preachers. Second, because in the past I had quoted verses of
> Mawláná [Jaláliʾd-Dín] Rúmí in my sermons in support of various themes,
> for some time they accused me of being one of the Illuminists. Moreover,
> since this servant associated with Hájí Áqá Muhammad and his esteemed
> son, Hájí ʿAli Áqá, and they have shown kindness to me, then people have
> further alleged, ‘The Akhúnd is a Sufí [mystic]!’ And now they charge that
> I am a Bábí! This servant does not understand any of these proclivities.
> Of a certainty, whoever has reported on this matter to your august self is
misinformed.”

Finding this an opportune moment, the Mushíruʾl-Mulk interjected, “The
> honored Fádil, Áqá Mullá ʿAbduʾlláh, is a deeply learned and well-lettered
> man. He is the foremost preacher of the city and is often the ﬁrst to oﬀer
> homilies in the homes of the nobles [of Shíráz]. In fact, unlike the other
> rawdih-kháns, he attends such gatherings only with a written invitation. The [p.205]
> city’s inhabitants universally testify to his trustworthiness, faith, sagacity,
> sincerity, piety, and detachment. In particular, he gives the closing sermons in
> religious ceremonies at the mosque and my Husayniyyih during the months
of Muharram and Safar, and the blessed month of Ramadán.”

On hearing the Mushíruʾl-Mulk intercede in such manner, the Prince
> paused a bit and then addressed the prisoner, “Fádil, is what they claim
> about you and others accurate, or is it a calumny?” Fádil replied with wis-
> dom, “Your exalted self should know that I am a seeker. However, I have
> not yet determined the veracity or falsehood of this Faith and do not know
> of things hidden.” With this answer, the Prince was convinced and stated,
> “God willing, what they say about you are lies, and I hereby release you on
> the condition that from the depth of your heart you pray for His Majesty
> the King.” As such, the honored Fádil regained his freedom.

After him, Mullá ʿAbduʾlláh Biká’ was summoned, and as he was a man
> of weak constitution, he had conducted himself in a manner pleasing to
> them. He too was released. Others remained imprisoned.

Hájí Muhammad Khán Balúch

> During this period, Muhammad Khán Balúch came to Shíráz. The enemies
> informed [the governor] that a dervish from Baluchistan sympathetic to
> these people [i.e., Baháʾís] had arrived and in the streets and bazaars spoke
> in their praise. [The Hisámuʾs-Saltanih] ordered his immediate arrest, and
> the oﬃcers located him in the Bazaar Kafsh-duzha [shoemakers], and after
> beating him harshly with their sticks, took him to the Governor’s Ark. The
> governor instructed him to be imprisoned and chained with the friends
arrested earlier. My father, Áqá Mírzá Áqá, used to relate:

> When I heard that Muhammad Khán had also been apprehended, I
> consulted with several of the friends and decided to take action through
> Hájí Mírzá ʿAbduʾlláh Khán Bályuz, [the ʿUnuʾd-Dawlih,] an uncle of the
> Muvaqqaruʾd-Dawlih. (Though not a believer, he was a virtuous man and
somewhat informed of the truth of this Cause.)

I went to see him, saying, “This man is from Baluchistan and a British
> subject, and on the accusation of being a Bábí173 Dervish has been impris-
> oned by the Hisámuʾs-Saltanih. As you discharge the oﬃce of the Bályuzi,
> it behooves you to exert eﬀorts towards his release. Perchance it is best to
> undertake this matter through Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí Khán, the Navváb, who is
> the British Consul General and can insist upon this man’s freedom.” Hájí
> Mírzá ʿAbduʾlláh Khán gave assurance that in whatever way possible he
would bring about his release.

He then went to visit Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí Khán, telling him, “It has come to
> my attention that one of the British subjects, who came to visit [Shíráz], has
> been arrested as a Bábí by the Prince Hisámuʾs-Saltanih. This is an insult on
> you as the representative of the British Empire. You must oﬃcially confront
the governor and free Muhammad Khán from his prison.”

The Navváb thought about it a bit and then expressed his readiness. He
> met ceremoniously with the Prince [Hisámuʾs-Saltanih] and said to him,
> “From what has been heard, you have arrested a British subject known
> as Muhammad Khán Balúch. In light of the alliance between our respec-
> tive nations, this iniquitous deed is untimely and unwarranted. I ask you
[p.210]               oﬃcially to either surrender him to me, or to stand responsible before my

> person is a Bábí! That is the reason for his arrest.” The Navváb replied,
> “It is not proven to me that he is a Bábí. And even if he is, he is not an
> Iranian citizen. At worse, he can be asked to quit this turbulent city and
> return to his own abode.” The governor persisted, “He is an Iranian.” And
> the Navváb responded harshly, restating his earlier position, and soon the
> matter had escalated between them. The Navváb held his ground and spoke
> most strenuously. (At that time, the Navváb in Shíráz was like the present
consul and enjoyed much prestige.)

The governor-general ordered [Hájí] Muhammad Khán brought forthwith
> and in presence of the Navváb asked him, “Where are you from?” Hájí
> Muhammad Khán responded in his native dialect, “I am a Baluch.” “From
> which region of the Baluchistan?” the governor then inquired. [In accordance
> with the secret instructions he had received, Muhammad Khán] responded,
> “From the British Baluchistan.” The governor further stated, “Dervish, they
> say you are a Bábí!” “To begin with, a Dervish has no religion, whether Bábí
> or otherwise. I do not understand your meaning.” The Hisámuʾs-Saltanih
> replied, “If you are not a Bábí, then you must curse Subh Azal.”174 Muham-
> mad Khán stated, “I curse subh azal, zuhr azal, and shám azal. All three be
cursed! I do not know subh azal or shám abad!”175

This manner of speech caused everyone to laugh extensively. Muhammad
> Khán was surrendered to the Navváb, and together they left the Governor’s
> Ark.

> On regaining his freedom, [Hájí Muhammad Khán] came directly to
> our house where my father gave him one of his own suits and a pair of

It is noteworthy that by this date, 1871, the governor-general of Fárs still thought that
> Yahyá Azal was the head of the Bábí community, indicating that the news of Baháʾuʾlláh’s
> Declaration had not been widely promulgated even among the high-ranking oﬃcials. The
> title “Subh Azal”, literary, the Morn of Eternity, appears in an Islamic Tradition that is called
> Hadith Kumayl (or referred to as, “Risálat al-Kumayliyya,” Kumayl being a disciple of Imám
> ʿAlí), and a portion of it is quoted in by the Báb in Daláʾil Sabʿih (Bábíyyih Publication,
> p. 58). Mírzá Yahyá and his followers erroneously have taken this term as a reference to
> Mírzá Yahyá. It should be noted that the Báb only called him “Thamaratuʾl-Azalíyya” and
> “ ʿIsmuʾl-Azal” (see Mírzá Yahyá, Mustayqiz, pp. 391f.). However, the Báb did employ the
> title Suhb Azal in reference to various other leading Bábís and in the Kitáb Panj Shaʾn, He
employes this term to signify the recipient of divine inspiration.

Muhammad Khán, being a Baháʾí, did not hesitate to curse Subh Azal who had caused
> Baháʾuʾlláh much harm, and playing on Persian words, he saved himself. Zuhr is noontime,
> and shám refers to night.

The Release of Hájí Abúʾl-Hasan

> The wife of Hájí Abúʾl-Hasan177 was a religious and pious woman and
> in every manner was a support to her husband. She was also related to
> Shaykh Abú-Turáb, the Imám-Jumʿih, and as such, [my father] the Afnán
> consented that her kinsmen petition the Imám-Jumʿih178 for his interven-
> tion. Afterwards, the ladies of the household approached the Shaykh with
> this request, and he agreed to seek the husband’s freedom on the condition
that he would quit Shíráz for a while. The ladies accepted.

Subsequently, the Shaykh met with the Hisámuʾs-Saltanih and eventually
> persuaded the latter to release the Hájí with no further interrogations or
> troubles. On being released, the honored Hájí took his two esteemed sons
> and without a steed departed from the city in the direction of Sarvistan
and Maharlu. He related to me:

> Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí Khán was older and stronger, while Mírzá Muham-
> mad-Báqir Khán was younger and more delicate. I placed the latter on

> the wilderness. Every time I heard the footsteps of a wild animal or a
[p.215]         person, my whole being would tremble with fear, as if I had met the angel
of death.

It took me a while to reach Kharamih179 where, with the utmost diﬃculty

men, and then proceeded to the Holy Land and spent the rest of his life in that region.

Placing my reliance in God, I therefore returned to the city.

In Shíráz, all the tumults of the past had subsided, and only the same few

> Shaykh Abú-Turáb, and he would publicly speak of my faith, uprightness,
and the excellence of my character.

Finally, I decided to open a haberdasher shop at the Bazaar Hájí—one
> of the bazaars of Shíráz. However, every storeowner I approached to lease a
> place refused me, and it was only Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán who, without rent,
> gave me a small store that he owned at the entrance of the Bazaar.181 Now
> that I had a shop, I did not have the capital for merchandise. Once more,
> I went to the honored Afnán and apprised him of my situation. Without a
> word, thought, or hesitation, he went inside the house and came out with one
hundred tumáns cash as a loan. I raised my voice in gratitude to God.

Starting the following day, placing all my reliance in the Almighty
> Lord, I opened my shop and began selling some triﬂing items. The divine
> conﬁrmations poured forth, and soon I was successful. However, the other
> shopkeepers continued to cause many disturbances.

At the time, he was residing in the House of the Báb.

To the present day, this shop remains part of the estate of the descendants of Núriʾd-
Dín (Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán, private communications, August 1995).

Lit., the Sinner, a self-adopted title of Hájí Muhammad-Karím Khán. Baháʾuʾlláh
conﬁrms that the Qurʾán prophesied him through this title.

A brief summary appears in Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúruʾl-Haqq, vol. 5, pp. 144–45.

The remaining three believers, namely, Mírzá Áqá Rikáb-Sáz, Mashhadí
> Nabí,184 and Mashhadí Muhammad-Jaʿfar [Khayyát], however, continued
> to languish in conﬁnement. Noting that through various means the other
> prisoners had been released greatly fueled the enmity and hatred of Shaykh
> Husayn Zálim. Therefore, he went before the Hisámuʾs-Saltanih, raucously
> raising the cry, “Our religion and faith is lost!” and spoke vehemently [in
> demand of severe disposition of the three imprisoned believers]. The Prince
> was induced to concur with his view and summoned the three men before
> him. No matter how they tried to force the three to recant their faith,
> they remained steadfast in their convictions, nay, would grow stronger in
> their constancy. The Qájár Prince was most bewildered. Immediately at
> that session, Shaykh Zálim wrote and issued a fatwá for their martyrdom,
> handing it to the Qájár oﬀspring. That very night, the three believers were
strangled with ropes in their prison cells.

The following morning, their wives and families were informed of their
> martyrdom and allowed to come and claim the bodies. After the ritual
> ablutions, the three martyrs were buried in Daruʾl-Salam, which is one
the famous cemeteries of Shíráz.185

Subsequent to these martyrdoms, the rabble continued to perpetrate
[p.220] untold atrocities. They would compose unseemly verses, and in the streets

> and the bazaar chant such songs. On the fortieth day of the martyrdom of
> those devotees of the Beloved’s Visage, all the rogue and lewd characters
> gathered, perpetrating every manner of insolence, brutality, and viciousness.
> Raising bags ﬁlled with diverse ﬁlth, refuse, sheep-skins, and dogs over
> their heads, they marched for four or ﬁve hours through the city, streets,
> and bazaars while singing and chanting slogans, and thence proceeding to
> the cemetery where they threw their heinous load on the graves of those
> fallen victims and committed yet other wicked and reprehensible acts.
> Truly, pen and tongue are ashamed of mentioning their deeds. Now that
> some ﬁfty years186 have passed since those days, on meeting one of the
> believers, the Shírází children still chant those contemptible verses.

Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúruʾl-Haqq, vol. 6, pp. 860–61, states that two years earlier,
> in AH 1286 [1869], he had walked to ʿAkká in the hope of attaining the presence of
> Baháʾuʾlláh. In the company of a group of pilgrims, he reached his destination, but instruc-
> tions were received from Baháʾuʾlláh that, on account of certain diﬃculties, the visitors
should not come within the citadel. Mashhadí Nabí immediately returned to Iran.

A detailed description of this episode is given in Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúruʾl-Haqq,
vol. 6, pp. 858–61; see also Shoghi Eﬀendi, God Passes By, p. 200.

One of the internal evidences that suggest this narrative was composed in early
1920s.

It was shortly after these events that the Hisámuʾs-Saltinih was dismissed
> from oﬃce and departed from Fárs. With his departure from the scene,
much of the persecution against the Faith abated.

Subsequent to these occurrences, the wife [of Rikáb-Sáz] was overcome
> with regret and remorse, but of what use! Those wronged-ones had already
> won their glorious station, leaving behind this troubled plane for the
> exalted paradise, the Abhá Kingdom and the everlasting bliss, hearkening
> to the Tongue of Grandeur, “Blessed are they and happy is their end.”
> Because of their deeds, history will forever recall their bravery and signal
achievement.

The wife [of Rikáb-Sáz] arranged for a large gravestone with his illustri-
> ous name and dates engraved upon it, and this was placed over his resting
> spot. However, the vagabonds learned of this and demolished the stone
> and the gravesite. Until her very last hour, she was ﬁlled with regret over
> her deeds and would lament bitterly. The One Compassionate God is the
> forgiver of the sins.187

A moving summary of the martyrdom of these three believers is given in Mázan-
> darání, Táríkh Zuhúruʾl-Haqq, vol. 5, pp. 134–36, where its occurrence is dated AH
> 1288 [1871].

CHAPTER NINE

THE PASSING OF KHADÍJIH BAGUM

[p.222:9] During this period, various teachers of God’s Cause and diﬀusers of the

> Divine Word arrived in Fárs in service to the Faith, thereby renewing the
> spiritual life of many souls. Amid such teachers coming to Shíráz was Áqá
> Mullá Muhammad Qáʾiní, [surnamed] Nabíl Akbar, who ranked among
> the foremost promoters of the Cause. His stay in Fárs lasted some thir-
> teen months and produced many beneﬁts for the province and nearby
> territories, resulting in the ediﬁcation of a number of individuals.

Munírih Khánum’s Sojourn in Shíráz

> During Shavvál of AH 1288 [December 1871], Munírih Khánum,
> who was traveling to the Holy Land for the purpose of her marriage to
> ʿAbduʾl-Bahá, arrived in Shíráz from Isfahán. [Prior to her arrival,] a letter
> addressed to Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán was sent from Isfahán by Áqá Mírzá
> Muhammad-Hasan, the Sultánuʾsh-Shuhadá188 [the King of Martyrs],
> indicating that in accordance with Baháʾuʾlláh’s instructions, Munírih
> Khánum, an accomplished daughter of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí Nahriy,
> together with her brother, Áqá Siyyid Yahyá, were to proceed to the Holy
> Land and en route would arrive [in Shíráz] and that a residence was to
be designated for their stay.

After considering the contents of this letter from Isfahán, the Afnán
> consulted with Khadíjih Bagum and because of its proximity to her own
> residence, she proposed the house of the Khál [Akbar], Hájí Mírzá Siyyid
> Muhammad, as the residence for the coming guests. At that time, Khadíjih
> Bagum lived in the house of Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, the Khál [Aʿzam],
> with her maternal sister [Hájíyyih Bíbí Ján-Ján], who was the widow of
> the martyred-uncle, and the homes of the two uncles were adjacent to
> one another, connected by a common wall. Therefore, this house was
> designated for Munírih Khánum’s stay.

Balyúzí, Eminent Baháʾís in the Time of Baháʾuʾlláh, p. 231, attributes the letter to
the Mahbúbuʾsh-Shuhadá [the Beloved of Martyrs].

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 92                                                                                      7/10/2008 3:45:18 PM

Munírih Khánum and her brother, Áqá Siyyid Yahyá, arrived in the [p.225]
> month of Dhiʾl-Qaʿdih [January 1872]. During their sojourn, she was a
> constant companion and consort of Khadíjih Bagum, and wherever they
> visited were in each other’s company. For a few nights, she also tarried
> at the residence of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán. After a stay of 15 days in
> Shíráz, Munírih Khánum departed for Búshihr and eventually the Holy
Land.189

While she was in Shíráz, one day during the course of their conver-
> sations, Khadíjih Bagum stated, “Having been in the hands of diverse
> individuals, the Blessed House of the Báb has suﬀered extensively and
> stands in ruin. I wish for it to be renovated so that I could take my resi-
> dence there. When you have attained the sacred presence [of Baháʾuʾlláh],
> kindly implore Him that the request of this forsaken one be graced with
> the favor of acceptance so that I would be able to take my residence
> there for the protection of the House.” [Munírih Khánum] had written
> down her supplication and presented it to Baháʾuʾlláh, Who graciously
> commanded Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán to renovate the House in whatever
> manner Khadíjih Bagum desired and for her residence to be transferred
> there afterwards.

Renovation of the House of the Báb

> Subsequent to issuance of His blessed instruction, the Afnán commenced
> the repair work. He designated one of the believers Ustád ʿAbduʾr-Razzáq
> [a mason of Shíráz] as the construction supervisor and the laborers’ over-
> seer, himself visiting the site two or three times daily. In the course of
> this renovation, major architectural modiﬁcations were introduced, and
> the design and conﬁguration of the entire House were changed from the
original layout.

This work was completed after several months. While the reconstruc-
> tion was taking place, a small house adjacent on the eastern ﬂank that
> belonged to a Jewish man who had recently converted to Islam was pur-
> chased at the owner’s insistence, renovated, and made part of the Blessed
> House of the Báb.

See Balyúzí, Baháʾuʾlláh the King of Glory, pp. 344–47.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 93                                                                   7/10/2008 3:45:18 PM

After completion of the renovation, Khadíjih Bagum took up residence
> in the Blessed House in AH 1290 [1873]. Once more the friends began
to come on pilgrimage to that sacred spot and to visit that exalted leaf.

Certain sinister men reported this development to Farhád Mírzá, the
> Muʿtamiduʾd-Dawlih. That is, one day, several of the mischief-makers called
> on the Muʿtamiduʾd-Dawlih and informed him about the Blessed House.
> The gist of their comments was, “The House of the Siyyid-i Báb is now
> renovated and occupied by some of His kinsmen, and visitors from here
> and there frequent the House.” Mírzá Abúʾl-Hasan Khán Munshí-Báshí
> and Mírzá Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín Khán ʿAlí-Ábádí, who ranked among the most
> pious of men and devoted Baháʾís, were in attendance in that meeting
and heard the matter [reported to the governor].

Four hours into the night, these two believers came to the residence
> of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán and informed him of what had transpired in
> the meeting with the Prince, adding their recommendation, “It would be
> best if for some time the Holy Mother190 [i.e., Khadíjih Bagum] did not
reside in the House, allowing such talk to subside.”

The following morning, the Afnán gained the presence of Khadíjih
> Bagum and informed her of the details, as conveyed by the Munshí-Báshí
> and Áqá Mírzá Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín Khán, suggesting that it would be bet-
> ter if for several months she did not live there. At ﬁrst, she had sobbed
> bitterly; but eventually she consented to move her residence, not to the
> house that she previously lived in, but to the home of her nephew, Áqá
> Mírzá Áqá Afnán. That very day, together with her maidservant, Fiddih,
> she transferred her residence to the home of my late father and lived there
for ﬁve and a half months.

When various machinations were alleviated, Khadíjih Bagum returned
[p.230] to the House of the Báb, but lived there with the utmost wisdom. She

> never used the main entrance of the House, and all the comings and
> goings were through the entrance of the newly acquired house.191

The original is “Bí bí,” a term of endearment for the older ladies of the house.

It seems that Khadíjih Bagum’s residence in the House of the Báb continued to agitate
> the neighborhood. In a Tablet dated 19 Safar AH 1295 [22 February 1878] Baháʾuʾlláh
instructs Núriʾd-Dín in Shíráz (NC 16):

> If at this time residence in the True House by the blessed wife, upon her rest all
> My Glory and My Exaltation, provokes commotion among Our servants and causes
> uproar and tyranny, then dwelling in that location is not permitted. . . .Under all
> conditions, wisdom must be observed. If in these days, habitation in the House by
> the wife [Khadíjih Bagum] or the Afnán is against wisdom and prudence, then its
> doors must be closed and none be allowed to dwell therein.

Dahají in Shíráz

> During this period, Hájí Siyyid ʿAlí-Akbar Dahají arrived in Shíráz and
> commenced teaching and proclaiming the Cause. In accordance with
> the instructions of the Blessed Perfection, he was also engaged in tran-
> scribing a protection prayer revealed by the Exalted Pen of the Primal
> Point. Copies were made for each of the friends for a contribution of an
> Ashrafí.192 My father acquired a copy for each one of us, and the copies
> are currently available.

Departure of the Afnán from Shíráz

> The news of the martyrdom of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn, the
> Mahbúbuʾsh-Shuhadá, and Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Hasan, the Sultánuʾsh-
> Shuhadá, in Isfahán in AH 1296 [1879], soon reached Shíráz. At that
> time, Farhád Mírzá, the Muʿtamiduʾd-Dawlih, was the governor-general,
> and this Qájár Prince was extremely antagonistic [towards the Cause].
> There was great commotion in Shíráz, and merchants and shopkeepers
> in the customs, the commercial oﬃces, and the bazaar spoke ceaselessly
> of the events of Isfahán. The elders [of the community] were particularly
> apprehensive, since it was only recently that the episode of the Three
Martyrs had occurred in Shíráz.

The elders were enveloped in fear. Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí, Hájí
> Mírzá Buzurg, Áqá Siyyid Muhammad-Husayn, Áqá Mírzá Abúʾl-Hasan,
> Áqá Shaykh ʿAlí Mírzá, and a number of other friends gathered and
> consulted on the situation. They concluded that Áqá Mírzá Áqá [Núriʾd-
> Dín] was most renowned [as a Baháʾí], and should atrocities be plotted
> against the community, they would of a certainty be directed at him.
> They said, “None of us are known [as Baháʾís] among the people. From
> the very beginning, because of his devotion, zeal, and associations, Áqá
> Mírzá Áqá is known [as a Baháʾí,] and should troubles now be directed
> against him, others would suﬀer as well.” Each of them spoke in similar
> manner, until they unanimously resolved that it was best for Áqá Mírzá
> Áqá Afnán not to remain in Shíráz and through Búshihr to depart forth-
> with for Bombay.

A gold coin.

Afterwards, in its entirety, this consultative body came to the residence
> of the Afnán and informed him of their decision that in light of the
> turmoil, upheavals, and chaos in Shíráz and all the talk current among
> the people, it was more prudent for him to arrange his aﬀairs and depart
> immediately for Búshihr.193 Though Áqá Mírzá Áqá had oﬀered many
> arguments, the elders did not accept them so that, on account of their
> insistence and within twenty-four hours, he left for Búshihr with his
personal attendant, and then for Bombay [India].194

With his departure, inactivity and dormancy fell for a while upon the
> province of Fárs. [Baháʾí] meetings were infrequent, and the friends would
> rarely gather. Even such devoted believers as Áqá Mullá ʿAbduʾlláh Fádil,
> [surnamed] Rafíʿ-Badíʿ, Áqá Mírzá ʿAbduʾl-Karím, and some others would
> comment, “With the departure of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán, the light of Fárs
> has become eclipsed. We did not appreciate all his merits. The worth of
each thing becomes apparent in its absence.”

For a while it went thus, until once again the Exalted and Glorious
> God sent forth such devoted personages as Hájí Mírzá Ghulám-Husayn,
> Áqá Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, and Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán. Through
> these sacred and enkindled ﬁgures, and their zeal and energy, life was
> renewed in Fárs, and all were rejuvenated. It was during this time that
> the divinely learned and spiritually awakened Hájí Mírzá Haydar-ʿAlí
[p.235] arrived in Shíráz, and the friends commenced holding many gathering

> to beneﬁt from his wondrous presence, and a new fervor and spirit was
> breathed into all.

The Final Years of Khadíjih Bagum, Her Illness and Passing

> After the departure of the Báb from Shíráz and the subsequent news
> of the martyrdom of His Holiness, His mother together with her own
> mother, in the company of her brother, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad,
> left for the ʿAtabát where she remained the rest of her days. During this

Private correspondence between the two martyred brothers in Isfahán, namely, the
> King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs, indicates that they were business partners
> with Núriʾd-Dín. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that part of the concern for the
> latter stemmed from the fear that the enemies of the fallen brothers in Isfahán would try
to extend their hostilities to all their business partners, including Núriʾd-Dín.

About a year later, in a Tablet dated 14 Rabíʿuʾth-Thání AH 1297 [26 March 1880],
> Baháʾuʾlláh instructed Núriʾd-Dín to commence business and commerce: “In accordance
> with the divine decree, that illustrious personage must become engaged in trade, and assur-
> edly means for such an occupation will be made ready” (Núriʾd-Dín Collection, p. 22).

> time, Khadíjih Bagum was alone in Shíráz, consumed by her inner agita-
> tion over the fate of her exalted Husband. Day and night she burnt like
> a candle, her sorrow and despondency knowing no end and her anguish
> being bottomless. With each ﬂeeting day, she grew increasingly aﬄicted,
depressed, and ill.

The Blessed Beauty’s residence at the Abode of Peace [Baghdad] and
> the arrival of His many Tablets, however, instilled an everlasting spirit
> and eternal life into her. Once more, as result of Baháʾuʾlláh’s inﬁnite
> loving-kindness, she was ﬁlled with zeal and strength and decided to
> journey to His blessed presence. Out of concern for his sister, Hájí Mírzá
> Abúʾl-Qásim<11> prevented her from this journey though. She, however,
> continued longing and hoping that means would be arranged for her to
> attain the bounty of presence. Not long thereafter, news was received
> that the Blessed Beauty had been further exiled, ﬁrst to Istanbul and
> then Edirne, and as such her hopes for visiting Him and beholding His
> Countenance were thoroughly shattered. Her sole consolation was now
the Tablets that bore the loving expressions of her kind Lord.195

In the year AH 1298 [1881], Siyyid ʿAlí196 came from Yazd to Shíráz
> and attained the presence of Khadíjih Bagum. He stayed for several
> months and often, day and night, would come visit Khadíjih Bagum. In
> the course of his conversations, he expressed his desire to visit the Holy
> Land and implored her to intercede on his behalf so that one of the
> exalted leaves [of Baháʾuʾlláh] would join him in matrimony. In response,
> Khadíjih Bagum stated, “I will make this request, and of a certainty my
> supplication will ﬁnd acceptance in His sacred presence. However, you
> must promise that when the appointed time has arrived, you will come
> from Yazd to Shíráz and take me with you to the Holy Land.” Siyyid
> ʿAlí placed both hands on his eyes, stating, “As a humble servant, I am
> at your service.” Assured of his solemn promise, she penned a supplica-
> tion requesting and imploring marriage [between Siyyid ʿAlí and one of
> Baháʾuʾlláh’s daughters] and sent the envelope to Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán
> in Bombay. In turn, my father forwarded her missive along with his own
> supplication to the Holy Land.197

Several of Baháʾuʾlláh’s Tablets to Khadíjih Bagum are included in INBMC
51:252–62, nos. 258–66.

In the original manuscript, often Siyyid ʿAlí’s name follows a blank space, suggesting
a descriptive phrase associated with his mention has been erased by later hands.

In his Memories, Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh notes that in this request; ʿAbduʾl-Bahá was also
instrumental in petitioning Baháʾuʾlláh to consent to this marriage.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 97                                                                                      7/10/2008 3:45:19 PM

98                                  chapter nine

Meanwhile, Siyyid ʿAlí returned to Yazd awaiting the news from the
> Holy Land. When the missive [from Khadíjih Bagum] was presented
> into the sanctiﬁed presence of Baháʾuʾlláh, her request was favored with
> approval. When this glad tiding from the Holy Land was received, Khadíjih
Bagum conveyed it to Yazd, adding:

> Praise be to God that the request of this desolate one was graced with
> approval. Now I have nothing further to do in Shíráz and have made the nec-
> essary preparations for the journey awaiting your arrival. Of a certainty, you
> must leave at once and come to Shíráz so that we can journey together.

> Day and night, she was beaming with joy and exhilaration. When the
> friends would attain her presence, the sole subject of her discourse was
[p.240] her forthcoming journey. She had seen to all the necessary arrangements

> expecting the arrival of a letter from Yazd and the news of the family
> members coming to Shíráz. Indeed she was counting every ﬂeeting hour.
> With the delivery of every post, she would quickly dispatch her servant
to check to see if a communication had been received from Yazd.

Meanwhile, Siyyid ʿAlí, his parents, brothers, and sister departed from
> Yazd and through ʿIshqábád and Istanbul proceeded [to the Holy Land].
He wrote her:

> Since we were traveling as a group, wisdom dictated that we do not journey
> through Shíráz. Therefore, we voyaged by way of ʿIshqábád. After attaining
> His sacred presence and fulﬁlling my objective, I will return to Shíráz and
> accompany you to the Holy Land.

> On seeing this letter from Yazd and beholding its message—which was
> indeed the angel of death, slaying the spirit of that devotee of the Beloved—
> Khadíjih Bagum cried out loud and sobbed and moaned bitterly, speaking
> expressions of disappointment and distress. For some two hours she cried
> and lamented unceasingly.198 That very day, she contracted a fever, which
> made her bedridden for ﬁve and a half months and eventually led to her
> passing on 2 Dhiʾl-Hajjih AH 1299 [15 October 1882],199 when that
> leaf of paradise ascended from this world of dust, and her triumphant
> spirit soared to the Supreme Concourse and Abhá Paradise, relieved of
> its separation and rejoicing in everlasting union.

See appendix 6 for Baháʾuʾlláh’s Tablet regarding the ﬁnal letter of Khadíjih Bagum
to Him.

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh added marginally, “I have the letter of the late Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-
Qásim providing this date.”

Burial of Khadíjih Bagum

> It was ﬁve hours into the night that her remains were conducted out of
> the Blessed House and after ritual washing and shrouding, her earthly
remains were interred. . . .200

In honor of that ever-present spirit, the Blessed Perfection revealed
> a Visitation Tablet that tells of her condition.201 Only one verse of that
> Tablet of Visitation will be cited at this point to illustrate the depth of
> her yearning and despondency: “We testify that in thee two signs were
> conjoined and evident: the verse of reunion gave thee life, whereas the
verse of separation caused thee to expire.”

The period of residence of Khadíjih Bagum in the Blessed House was
nine years prior to her ascension.

The text of her Visitation Tablet will be quoted in its entirety for the
> reader to gain insight into the exalted station of faith and certitude that

Washing of the dead and shrouding took place at Hammam Khayrí, otherwise known
as Guldastih (Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán, private communications, August 1995).

On 10 November 1882, Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim, the brother-in-law of the Báb,
> wrote to Áqá Mírzá Áqá Núriʾd-Dín about the passing of his sister, Khadíjih Bagum. In
> this letter, he asked Núriʾd-Dín to inform Baháʾuʾlláh of the passing of Khadíjih Bagum as
> result of her profound disappointment in not being able to visit Him. Núriʾd-Dín wrote
> as bidden, and in response to his missive he received a Tablet from Baháʾuʾlláh, which
> contained a Tablet of Visitation revealed in honor of Khadíjih Bagum. A facsimile of this
> Text in the hand of Mírzá Áqá Ján appears after page 186 in Fayzí, Khándán Afnán and
> can also be found in the Núriʾd-Dín Collection, pp. 74–82, dated 14 Safar AH 1300 [25
> December 1882]. A slight variation of the same Tablet appears in Baháʾuʾlláh, Áthár Qalam
> Aʿlá (Traces of the Supreme Pen), vol. 4, pp. 201–4, 125 BE, and in the same volume, 133
> BE publication, pp. 339–41. Moreover, a version is included in Ishráq-Khávarí’s Ayyám
> Tisʿih, pp. 29–31. However, the latter source does not include the paragraph beginning

> “Bless Thou, O Lord my God, the Divine Lote-Tree and its leaves, and its boughs, and
> its branches, and its stems, and its oﬀshoots, as long as Thy most excellent titles will
> endure and thy most august attributes will last. Protect it, then, from the mischief of the
> aggressor and the host of tyranny. Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the Most powerful.”
> This verse, of course, appears in the closing paragraph of the Tablet of Visitation for the
> Twin Manifestations as assembled by Nabíl Aʿzam. Nabíl’s source for this last section is
> not currently known, nor does this section appear in the facsimile copy.

behold, I heard a voice calling out:

O servant in attendance! What is it that hath made you so sorrowful and
> taken from your hands the reins of choice? Hath the world been darkened

Wherefore do I behold you immersed in an ocean of sorrow?
[p.245]             Now thy sad lamentations rise, and again thy tears descend. Where is the

> canopy of glory? Where the Tabernacle of happiness? Where the Tent of joy,
> the shelter of cheerfulness? Where is thy smiling face? Where the ornament
> of thy name, the servant? Where are thy determination and thy strength in
> transcribing that which the All-Merciful hath revealed for all existence? It
> is as if I beheld before me thy face become sallow, thy frame wasting, thy
> strength melting. I beseech the One Who aided thee and Who made thee
> cognizant and adorned thee with the ornament of acceptance and made
> thee stand before His countenance, and Who made thee hearken unto His
> melodies and His utterances, and caused to appear from thee that through
which the breezes of life were wafted, that thou disclose the matter.

I made reply: Doest thou not know what hath come to pass by virtue
> of the decree of our Lord, the King of Kings? I was bedecked in happiness
> as I was hearkening unto the Speaker of Sinai. Methinks I was pacing the
> meadows of joy and soaring in the atmosphere of felicity, and thus did I

> in the Face of our Lord the Most Glorious. Then did the Countenance
> of the Creator of the heavens turn to me and declare, exalted be His
station:

Didst thou not hear, O servant of God that which the irrevocable decree
> hath ordained? The Most Sublime Fruit hath fallen from the Divine Lote-
> Tree. She was indeed the Remnant of the Beloved of the World in the
Kingdom of His creation.

I swear by God, My Aim and the Aim of all things, when I saw the sor-

> have passed into the realm of non-existence. Then the Countenance of God
turned unto me and said:

O servant of God! The calamities of the People of Bahá are renewed
> as set down by the Supreme Pen, inasmuch as the established decree has
> come to pass on the Greatest Holy Leaf. Verily, she is indeed that Fruit at
> the mention of whose name the fragrance of Her Beloved is wafted, He
> through Whose Name the heavens are uplifted and by Whom the heavens
> are adorned with the Sun, Its eﬀulgence, and Its rays. Verily, her name in
> its essence as well as outwardly calls to the remembrance of the people
> the Days of Her Beloved and the Beloved of all things. She is indeed the
> leaf that clung unto the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing. She
> attained the meeting with the Lord of mankind. She precedes the entire
> world in this except such as God hath willed, the Lord of the Throne above
and of earth below.

Upon hearing this, sorrow overwhelmed me. My heart melted, my skin
> crept in grief, my limbs trembled, and my lamentations and wailings rose
> high until I returned to my abode and dwelling. I found it to be the house
> of sorrows, and I became occupied in transcribing that which the All-Merci-
> ful God hath revealed. After a few minutes passed, I was once more present
> before His Countenance by virtue of His sovereign command over all things.
> Then the Point of adoration of all existence seen and unseen turned to me
and declared, exalted be His majesty, and sublime are His words:

Bring thou pen and ink that I may make mention of the remnant of the
> Primal Point, she who sacriﬁced herself with love and devotion so that my
> loved ones from lands and cities may visit her and recite in her memory
these words.
These are His words, exalted and sanctiﬁed be He!

He is the Consoler, the Sorrowful!
O Pen! In truth a most mighty calamity and a great tragedy hath
> befallen Thee, by reason of which the Supreme Concourse and the denizens
> of the All Highest Realm are wailing. On this account sorrows have become
so great that they have touched the hem of the All-Merciful.

Blessed is he who hath determined to visit her in her life and after her
> ascension, and great is the blessedness of that handmaiden who hath sought
her resting place and through her sought nearness unto God.

The glory that shines from My Luminous Countenance and the light that
> is manifest from the heaven of My Name, the All-Glorious, rest upon thee,
> O thou who art the fruit of the Sadratuʾl-Muntahá, and the Holy Luminous
> Leaf upon that Tree, and the consort of the One through Whose Appearance
> the Kingdom of eternity, and all created things, were wreathed in smiles. We
> testify that thou art the ﬁrst leaf to have attained the chalice of reunion in
> the Day of the Covenant and the last fruit to surrender her soul in separa-

We testify that in thee two signs were conjoined and evident: the verse of

> thy calamity, a sea of grief was set in motion, and the breezes of forgive-
ness wafted.

I bear witness that on the night thou didst ascend to the Abhá Horizon

Thou art that one on account of whose calamity the maidens of paradise

> Kingdom of Names, didst accept Him, and this attraction enkindled thee
to such an extent that all control well nigh escaped thy hands.

O thou My leaf ! O thou who hast ﬂown in the atmosphere of My love!

> O thou who hast turned unto My Countenance, who hast spoken forth
> My praise! We have revealed for thee a remembrance whose traces will not

The Custodianship of the House of the Báb

> In accordance with the Blessed Perfection’s instructions, subsequent to the
> passing of Khadíjih Bagum, her sister took up residence in the Blessed
> House of the Báb. That is, Baháʾuʾlláh was asked about the protection
> and maintenance of the Blessed House, and in a Tablet addressed to Áqá
Mírzá Áqá Afnán it was revealed:

> The custodianship of the House hath been granted to the exalted leaf, the
mother of that illustrious personage [Núriʾd-Dín].

Thus spoke the Tongue of Grandeur at this moment: O My Afnán! My
> glory and My favor rest upon thee. The exalted noblewoman, mother of thy
> honored self, is worthy of residence in that House. Custodianship of the
> House hath therefore been granted and bestowed upon her, and after her,
> to her progeny, as they are the remembrance of God and of her throughout
> centuries and ages.203

> Consonant with Baháʾuʾlláh’s hallowed instruction, the illustrious sister [of
> Khadíjih Bagum], that is, the mother of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán, took up
> residence in the Blessed House and became the custodian and protector
> of that Sacred Ediﬁce. In the year AH 1302 [1884], instructions were
> issued from the heaven of Baháʾuʾlláh’s Grace and Mercy, and ﬁxed by
> His seal, for the custodianship of the Blessed House of the Báb to be
> entrusted to the sister [Zahrá Bagum] and her descendants. The original
> of this command, together with other Tablets revealed from the Pen of
> the Center of Covenant about the custodianship of the Blessed House,
> is now in the ﬁles of the custodians of that Threshold.204

been instructed previously. All are obliged to respect and honor that Sacred Ediﬁce.”

CHAPTER TEN

EVENTS OF 1880s

[p.254:4] During this period, the promoter of the Cause of God, Hájí Mírzá Haydar-

> ʿAlí Isfahání arrived in Shíráz.205 He stayed for a few months and traveled
> to various towns in Fárs, including Nayríz, Sarvistán, and Ábádih, and
> engaged in planting the seeds of faith. He succeeded in oﬀering great
> services and awakening a large number of individuals [to the Cause].

Imprisonment of Four Baháʾís from Sarvistán

> In the year AH 1300 [1882], during the governorship of Sultán Husayn
> Mírzá, the Jaláluʾd-Dawlih, and deputyship of Mírzá Fath-ʿAlí Khán, the
> Sáhib-Díván, a disturbance took place in Sarvistán between the friends
[p.255] and nonbelievers that escalated into a serious contention. As such, a

> report was sent to Shíráz, and the governor-general commissioned ʿAlí
> Khán to proceed to Sarvistán, thoroughly investigate the matter, and
report to him.

After the arrival of ʿAlí Khán, non-Baháʾís gathered around him and
> recounted many absurdities. Since ʿAlí Khán was a mischievous person,
> he connived with them and sent a report to Shíráz to their liking. This
> precipitated an instruction by the authorities that the suspected persons
> [i.e., Baháʾís] were to be [arrested and] sent to Shíráz. ʿAlí Khán chained
> the following [four Baháʾís] and sent them from Sarvistán to Shíráz:
> Karbaláʾí Hasan Khán; Karbaláʾí Sádiq; Mashhadí Sulaymán; and Ghu-
lám-ʿAlí Khán, grandson of Karbaláʾí Hasan Khán.

Upon their arrival, they were presented at the governor’s garden to the
Sáhib-Díván,206 who after interrogation commanded their beating. The

The second son of Hájí Mírzá ʿAlí-Akbar, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk I, and a son-in-law

> farrashes assembled the bastinado and applied it severely to Karbaláʾí
> Hasan Khán. After him, Karbaláʾí Sádiq was battered extensively, and he
> was followed by Mashhadí Sulaymán. When it was Ghulám-ʿAlí’s turn to
> sustain the blows of the bastinado, that brave soul spoke critically of the
> authorities, “We have done no wrong. Your purpose is to harm innocent
> people. ʿAlí Khán has falsely reported.” Each prisoner was stricken [by
> bastinado] for an hour. Afterwards, they were ordered chained and fettered
> in a dungeon along with thieves and highway bandits. For some time,
they remained thus constrained.

Being young, fearless, and ﬁlled with fervor and enthusiasm when he
> had converted, Ghulám-ʿAlí Khán, out of devotion, valor, and bravery,
> had tattooed on his right arm, “The Visage of Bahá stands manifest,” and
> on the left arm, “And its eﬀulgence revives me.” This was a sign by which
that courageous and peerless young man was known as a Baháʾí.

One day, the Sáhib-Díván summoned Ghulám-ʿAlí Khán, and in chains
> the prisoner was conducted before him. The minister ordered the prisoner’s
> shirtsleeves rolled up and then asked the captive, “What marks are these on
> your arms?” With utmost courage and in a thunderous voice, he replied,
> “This is the Name of my Beloved” and thereupon had proceeded to chant
> the verse. Bewildered, the Sáhib-Díván asked further, “Are you not afraid to
> so boldly express your conviction?” “If I was apprehensive of consequences,
> I would not have engraved these tattoos.” The Sáhib-Díván called in the
> executioner and ordered him to sever the prisoner’s ears. Afterwards, as a
> lesson to all, he was paraded in the bazaar and subsequently imprisoned
> again. For some time, he continued to remain in the Sáhib-Díván’s con-
> ﬁnement, along with his honored grandfather, Karbaláʾí Hasan Khán; his
mother’s uncle, Karbaláʾí Sádiq; and Mashhadí Sulaymán.

After ﬁve years, the Sáhib-Díván was dismissed from the governorship
> of Fárs and left Shíráz. Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk
> [III],207 implemented these believers’ release from conﬁnement and aided
> their return to Sarvistán.208

A son of ʿAlí-Muhammad Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk II, he was born in Shíráz in
> 1851 and in 1871 assumed the oﬃces of Kalántar and Biglar-Baykí of the province. Upon
> the passing of his father in 1884, he inherited his title and his vast estate. For biography

Renewed Troubles for the Believers of Sarvistán

> In AH 1305 [1887], the central government appointed the Prince Uvays
> Mírzá, the Ihtishámʾd-Dawlih,209 as the governor-general of Fárs. The Prince
was ceremoniously installed in oﬃce and assumed the governorship.

During these years, once more, mischief-makers caused disturbance in
> Sarvistán, resulting in a great clamor [against the Baháʾí Faith]. During
> those days, Karbaláʾí Hasan Khán and Karbaláʾí Sádiq were in Shíráz, and
[p.260] these believers were seized and imprisoned. Ghulám-ʿAlí Khán, however,

> managed to eﬀect his escape for Tihrán. The Prince had ordered his
> arrest, only to be told that the fugitive had ﬂed for the capital. As such,
> the governor informed Kamrán Mírzá, the Náybuʾs-Saltanih,210 of the
> imminent arrival of a Sarvistání Bábí who bore the mark of being a Baháʾí
> on his arms, and urged surveillance to ensure that he did not cause any
> troubles while in Tihrán. Ghulám-ʿAlí Khán resided in the capital for
> several years and passed away in that city. He was buried at the Shrine
> of Sháh ʿAbduʾl-Aʿzím.

Muhammad-Qásim Khán Baydáʾyí

> Another incident that occurred during AH 1305 [1887] in the course
> of the governorship of Uvays Mírzá, the Ihtishámuʾd-Dawlih, was as
follows.211

Muhammad-Qásim Khán Baydáʾyí was among the aﬄuent and pros-
> perous landlords of the city. He had accepted the governorship of vari-
> ous important locations in Fárs and for a few years had been the mayor
> of Bihbahán. In that year [1887] he was removed from oﬃce there and
came to Shíráz.

One day, the Prince paid him a visit and was received with consider-
> able pomp and ceremony. [Muhammad-Qásim Khán] had procured a
> precious golden water-pipe while in Bihbahán, and as means of oﬀering
> the ultimate compliment to his honored guest, he had his attendants

> prepare the pipe for the Prince and had it brought in for his enjoyment.
> The Prince [Ihtishámuʾd-Dawlih] had greatly praised his host’s water-pipe,
its manufacture, and its crown.

Upon the conclusion of the gathering and his departure, [Muhammad-]
> Qásim Khán had placed that water-pipe and some gold coins in a box and
> sent them after the Prince as a gift to him. This act of generosity greatly
> impressed the governor, and from then on he always sought an occasion to
> repay this kindness. It was not long after that the situation of the books,
Tablets, and Writings occurred, and that incident is as follows.

By reason of his devotion and aﬀection for the Cause, Muhammad-
> Qásim Khán always preferred to employ servants and maidservants who
> were his conﬁdants and had an aﬃnity [for the Baháʾí Faith]. There was
> a certain Hájí Murshid and his wife, who both claimed allegiance to the
> Cause. Because of this, Muhammad-Qásim Khán and his wife, who was
> a most devoted and enkindled believer as well, had the greatest conﬁ-
> dence and trust in this man and woman, to the point that the complete
> authority and control of their vault was entrusted to Hájí Murshid’s
> wife, who knew all the details of their precious possessions. The wife of
[Muhammad-Qásim] Khán was ailing, paralyzed, and bedridden.

One day, the wife of Hájí Murshid, intending to steal some of her
> mistress’ possessions, went into the vault, opened the box containing
> some of her clothing, and noticed that there were two smaller boxes
> within. She picked up both boxes and concealed them in the kitchen. At
> nighttime, when all the servants and the members of the household had
> retired for the evening and quiet had enveloped the house, she opened
> the two boxes. She noticed one box contained ornaments, jewels, and
> gold articles. The other box, she noted, contained books, papers, and
> writings. The maidservant hid the box of the jewels in the stove and cast
> the other box from the kitchen’s chimney into the street. This latter box
> contained treatises and sacred writings, and also included the copy of a
> missive to the Holy Land that the entire family numbering forty or ﬁfty
men and women had signed.

On her way to mosque early next morning, the daughter of Mírzá [p.265]
> Muhammad-Ridá Mustawfí, who was a very temperamental and acrimo-
> nious woman, noticed the box behind the home of Muhammad-Qásim
> Khán. Having taken the box home, she noticed that it was ﬁlled with
> Baháʾí writings and materials. She also found the supplication [to the Holy
> Land] and was thrilled by discovering in such a document the perfect
> means for causing mischief. After considering the contents, she took the

> box and its contents to an ostentatiously pedantic mujtahid known as
Siyyid ʿAlí-Akbar Fál-Asírí,212 who was regarded as a senseless Siyyid.

Upon perusal of the documents, the Siyyid realized that he had arrived
> at a means for great mischief and hence immediately raised the cry, “Our
> religion is lost!” He proceeded to the Masjid Vakíl, where he stirred up
> the people, exclaiming, “You must forthwith attack and destroy the home
> of [Muhammad-] Qásim Khán, and on account of this missive they have
> sent to their leader [i.e., Baháʾuʾlláh] kill the entire household!” The call
took hold across the city.

While attending the Masjid Naw, the late Mírzá Yúsuf Khán, who
> was a son-in-law of [Muhammad-Qásim] Khán, heard this call and went
> before the Khán and apprised him of the situation. Muhammad-Qásim
> Khán became extremely apprehensive and immediately inspected his
> vault, only to discover that his two boxes were missing. He realized that it
> must be the work of Hájí Murshid’s wife. He summoned the woman and
> inquired from her in this regard. At ﬁrst she denied any involvement, but
> after persistent questioning and threats, she confessed to having hidden
> the jewelry box in the oven and tossing out the box of papers through
chimney into the streets.

When the late Muhammad-Qásim Khán had learned of this, he imme-
> diately set out to visit the Prince and notiﬁed him of the occurrences
> and the involvement of Siyyid ʿAlí-Akbar. The Prince stated, “Do not be
> perturbed. If you are afraid to go home, you may stay in the governor’s
> Ark as my guest. Leave this issue to me as I know best how to extinguish
> such ﬁre and mischief.” Due to Muhammad-Qásim Khán’s previous gen-
> erosity, the Prince was awaiting an opportunity to repay his kindness and
> now found the opportune moment.

Fál and Asír are two neighboring villages near Búshihr, (Mázandarání, Táríkh

> the daughter of the celebrated Mírzáy-i Shírází and as such wielded much inﬂuence. During
> the Tobacco Revolt of 1891–92, he incited the people of Shíráz to sedition, whereupon
> on hearing this news, the government in Tihrán exiled him to Iraq. However, his depar-
> ture caused an uproar in Shíráz that was eventually quelled through the eﬀorts of Mírzá
> Muhammad-Ridá, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk. About two years later, the Siyyid was allowed to
> return to Shíráz where he resumed his iniquitous activities. This ill-tempered, arrogant
> divine was most prejudiced against the Baháʾí Faith, and as will be seen throughout the
> present narrative, he caused the martyrdom of a number of believers: three in 1869, two

Muhammad-Qásim Khán responded, “If you permit, I will take my
> leave since my wife and household look to me for support and protection,
> and if I do not go home, it would worry them.” The Prince gave him
> permission to leave and sent a few soldiers along to protect the home of
the late Khán.

Afterward, the Prince sent a message to the Siyyid stating, “I have
> heard that you have come upon some writings and documents from this
> wayward group [i.e., Baháʾís]. Please come and bring with you all these
> writings for my inspection. Together, I as the governor, and you as the
> guide on religious matters, we can best decide how to conduct the aﬀairs
in the most beneﬁcial manner to the luminous religion [of Islam].”

The Siyyid was most pleased with this message, thinking that he could
> now do as he pleased through the powers of the oﬃce of the governor.
> He placed all the writings, including the list of believers and the mis-
> sive [to Baháʾuʾlláh], back into the box and took it to the Prince [the
Ihtishámuʾd-Dawlih].

[In their meeting,] the Prince extended the Siyyid immense courtesy,
> well beyond the cleric’s rank, which greatly pleased the visitor and increased
> his conﬁdence. This interview lasted more than three hours, in the course
> of which the Siyyid spoke at length—all drivel—while the Prince pre-
> tended to be listening most attentively and to be in agreement. When [p.270]
> the hour for obligatory prayer arrived, the Siyyid asked for permission to
> take his leave. The Prince granted him leave with a request for a prayer.
> The Siyyid was about to take the box when the host stated with utmost
> politeness, “It would be best if you left the box with me as a trust, that I
> may study the papers more intently this evening. Come again tomorrow,
> and together we will decide how best to administer a due punishment
> upon this wayward people [i.e., Baháʾís], as their possessions and lives are
> fair game: their possessions belong to the state, and their blood belongs
> to the people.” The Siyyid was elated with this comment, and responded,
> “I obey whatever command Your Excellency decrees. I leave this box with
> you in trust and ask that no one else interfere with its contents.” The
Prince agreed, and the guest took his leave.

Upon his departure, the Prince sent word to the Khán to come see
> him. When he arrived, he heard the details of what had transpired. The
> Prince handed him the box, declaring, “Carefully consider the contents,
> and if you believe some items may have been left with the Siyyid let me
> know, that by some means those can be retrieved from him as well.”
> The late Khán had previously prepared a list of the box’s contents and

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 109                                                               7/10/2008 3:45:21 PM

> left it in the box. Using this list, he was able to determine that all the
> papers remained undisturbed. The Prince remarked, “Take the box, and
> do not worry any more. I will answer the Siyyid. Should a representative
> of the Siyyid come to you, without any fears, sternly rebuke him. Have
> no misgivings!” Expressing his profound gratitude and thanks, the late
> Khán took his leave and once arrived home informed the household of
> the occurrences and the wise manner in which the Prince had interceded
on his behalf. Everyone was most joyous.

The next day, relying on his previous day’s discussions with the governor,
> Siyyid [Fál-Asírí] sent a harshly worded message to [Muhammad-Qásim]
> Khán, essentially, “You are wayward and disdained. Your documents are
> with me. You have two choices. One is for you to ﬁll your boots with
> sand, rope them around your neck, barefooted and with one hand holding
> the sanctiﬁed Qurʾán and with the other holding a sword, come this very
> afternoon to the Masjid Vakíl to repent and recant, that I might pardon
> and forgive your sins. Should you fail to do so, I will issue appropriate
> fatwá against you instructing that your home be demolished and your
blood, as well as those whose names appear on the list, be shed.”

When this message was given to the Khán, he remained quiet, in some
> perplexity. The late Mírzá Yúsuf Khán advised, “Uncle, why do you not
> respond to the Siyyid?” “What am I to say?” inquired the Khán. “Allow
> me to respond in your place,” said the nephew. He then summoned the
> messenger and stated, “Convey to your master that his message for the
> Khán is like the message of Ibn Ziyád [for Imám Husayn]. When you
> have reached the stature of Ibn Ziyád, then we will do as bidden, wear
> our boots around our necks and, holding the Qurʾán and a sword, come
> in repentance. However, neither are you Ibn Ziyád, nor are we [Imám]
Husayn. Do what you can, and we will reciprocate!”

When this retort reached the Siyyid, it mortiﬁed him, and he immedi-
ately sought an audience with the Prince [Ihtishámuʾd-Dawlih] but was not
[p.275] received on an excuse. The following day, the Siyyid went for an audience

> again, but the Prince did not meet him and instead his farrashes stated,
> “His Excellency is ill.” When he returned the third day, he was told that
> the governor had gone hunting. He submitted a missive, only for it to
> remain unanswered. The Siyyid then realized that the Prince was making
excuses and was not of the same mind. He was outraged!

On the ﬁfth day, the Prince met with him. At ﬁrst, the Prince spoke
> softly with the Siyyid, who asked for the return of his trust. “I have
> not completed my study of the box’s contents,” the Prince responded,

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 110                                                                    7/10/2008 3:45:21 PM

> “and a few more days of reading are required. I will then decide on the
> appropriate disposition of this case.” “The religious ruling on this matter
> resides with me,” the Siyyid stated, “and there is no doubt left in me
> that [Muhammad-] Qásim Khán is a Bábí, as all these books and writ-
> ings are theirs. The life and possessions of these people [i.e., Baháʾís] are
> permissible to us.” The Prince retorted, “Why do you speak such things?
> If such books were found in any house, would they prove the owner a
> Bábí and his property and blood forfeited?” “If he were not a Bábí,” the
> Siyyid responded, “then the books of this wayward sect would not be
found in his house.”

The Prince considered the time propitious to rebut, “Siyyid, what do
> you think! Do you think the aﬀairs of government are left to men like
> you, to do as you please and allege all manner of unseemly slanders on
> distinguished people? I too keep copies of the Zoroastrian books, and the
> Old and New Testaments at home. Should it then be said that the Prince
> is a Zoroastrian, a Jew, or a Christian? What rubbish do you speak? Even if
> [Muhammad-] Qásim Khán did own diverse books, he cannot be accused
> of certain transgressions!” The Siyyid then realized he had miscalculated
> and that the Prince was furious. As he no longer had any evidence in
hand, he collected himself and kept his peace.

The Prince then ordered a water-pipe be brought in for the Siyyid and
> also his own golden water-pipe be prepared too. As they drank coﬀee, the
> Prince stated, “Siyyid, I swear on the royal robe, should you transgress
> your bounds and become the author of mischief, I will expel you from
the city.” In such wise, he dismissed the Siyyid from his presence.

The Siyyid remained home for a few days nursing his wounded pride
> and then emerged, never again speaking of this incident. The matter
> died down. The Prince met with Muhammad-Qásim Khán and thanked

Imprisonment of Sarvistání Believers

> ʿAlí-Akbar [Fál-Asírí] had waxed in enmity, animosity, and hatred [towards
> the Baháʾí Faith]. Each day he sought an opportunity to perpetrate trouble
and interference.

The celebrated Murtidá was a painter by profession and before his
> conversion to the Cause had been a venerated enemy of the Faith to the
> point that all the believers in Sarvistán had been particularly apprehensive
> and cautious of him. However, after he had come to believe, his condition
> had transformed so thoroughly that he was enkindled and ﬁlled with ardor,
> and without any consideration or fear, he would audaciously proclaim
> the Faith. His wife was a paternal cousin of Siyyid ʿAlí, the Mushíru’s-
> Sádát, who was an opprobrious and conniving man, deeply antagonistic
> towards the Cause. This uncle went before Siyyid ʿAlí-Akbar [Fál-Asírí]
> and informed him, “Murtidá has become a Bábí. His wife is my paternal
> cousin, and I do not wish for this perversion to stain our family’s good
> name. You must remedy this apostasy.”
[p.280]    Siyyid ʿAlí-Akbar [Fál-Asírí] sent his men213 to seize that wronged one

> must imprecate [this Movement],” commanded the Siyyid. “I will not
curse those I do not know,” ﬁrmly responded [Murtidá].

The crazed Siyyid commanded further beating and severe punishment
> of his victim. Afterwards, pending the issuance of a religious ruling and
> fatwá against him, Murtidá was sent before the Prince Uvays Mírzá on
> the charge that he was a Bábí, deserving incarceration. The Prince in

> imprison him in his cellar. After Áqá Murtidá was conﬁned, Siyyid ʿAlí,
> the Mushíru’s-Sádát, forced the wife of that wronged one to be brought

[from her legal husband].

Soon thereafter, through the instigation of Siyyid ʿAlí, Karbaláʾí Hasan

rank of prisoners.

It was in those times that the Prince was dismissed from oﬃce, but

Bagum.

Two months later, as part of a Tablet addressed to Áqá Siyyid Muham-

Beware lest the world’s vicissitudes cause thee to be despondent on

> moment of his ascension, and God hath forgiven him as a token of His
> Grace. He hath ordained for him in the Supreme Paradise a station such
as minds and fancies cannot comprehend.

O Abúʾl-Qásim! Upon thee be the glory of God and the glory of the cho-

Verily, we are God’s, and unto Him shall we return.216

We have turned from the Arabic tongue to the Persian that all may
understand the divine purpose and attain to it.

O Afnán, be not sorrowful on account of that which hath befallen thee.

and teaching of the Cause of God.

This Wronged-One hath from the earliest of days made mention of the

> and clear to the possessors of discernment and to them whose eyes are ﬁxed
> upon the Most Great Vision, that I have sought no advantage for Myself

creation, worship ye Me!’ ”

And also in reply to one of the Letters of the Living, making mention of

Arrival of Áqá Mírzá Ashraf, [nom de plume] ʿAndalíb in

ʿAndalíb, pp. 471–74):

> He is the All-Powerful, the All-Mighty, the Beloved.
Oh, in life’s cup the wine-pourer of the feast of decree

Poured life-ending venom instead of spirit-elating wine.
For every ache there is a remedy, for every trouble a solution,

Oh, for this remediless ache and this balmless trouble.
The eye of creation was stunned, the world’s heart darkened,

Heart’s orchard was withered, the nightingale of life silenced.
From this loss, the pillars of existence were dismantled,

From this loss, the eternal throne was crushed.
The waves of the surging Sea of Grace were stilled; instead,

Waves of grief ’s ocean gushed in the hearts and souls of the near ones.
The banner of the Most Excellent Names fell to the dust,

The lamentation of God’s Party was raised to the high heavens.

> The One by Whose Manifestation the Day of Resurrection dawned upon the
world,

By the setting of His sun a commotion made the world to quake.
The One Who in the Sinai of nearness called, “Behold, and thou shalt see,”

Dismayed many a Moses by His roar, “Never shalt thou behold.”
The Most Mighty Ocean sunk its Ruby Ship,

Whence a tempest of tears descended from the eyes of Noah.
Thus was the king of the visible world established upon the placeless throne,

Thus the Sun-like countenance became hid in the West of the eternal Holiness.
The ear was deprived of the song of the Nightingale of Paradise,

the eye was forbid the eﬀulgence of the Sun-like countenance.
For nineteen days that heavenly Beauty was bed-ridden,

At the dawn of Saturday, second of Dhiʾl-Qaʿdah He was veiled from us.
It was the sixteenth of the Roman month of Ayar,

It was the thirteenth of the month of ʿAzamat.
Of the Persian Naw-Rúz seventy days had passed,

And of the Migration, one thousand three hundred and nine years elapsed.
Then it was this tragedy occurred, this loss appeared,

And the phrase “Verily the Lord was hidden” became the mark of this tragedy.
With mine own eyes did I behold the clear morn of the Day of Resurrection,

As it surrounded the entire the land of ʿAkká,
As for the funeral ʿAkká’s population entire, low and noble,

Gathered in Bahjí to express their faithfulness.
The Persian believers lamented fate’s unchangeable decree,

And the native Arabs cried out, “Oh our Lord, Oh our Lord!”
For the washing of the Sacred Body in the haram, the Most Mighty Branch,

Stood at service solely out of His patience, resignation, and acquiescence.
His Holiness God’s Most Mighty Branch spoke to the friends compassionately,

Martyrdom of Two Believers

> In the year AH 1307 [1889], Hájí Siyyid ‘Alí-Akbar [Fál-Asírí] issued a
> fatwá for the slaying of Karbaláʾí Hasan Khán and gave it to the Prince
> Uvays Mírzá. That very night, that wronged one was poisoned and mar-
> tyred. The following day, without the ritual ablutions or the shrouding
> of the dead, and still in the same clothes that he wore [in the prison],
> he was buried next to the Masjid Hájí ʿAbbás, outside of the city limits.
> Despite all the obstacles and dangers, that night the Sarvistání believers
> located his grave and exhumed his remains, wrapped it in fabric, and
> moved it to Sarvistan where it was interred in a most verdant orchard
owned by the Khán himself.

This deed of the Sarvistání believers was most pleasing in the presence
> of Baháʾuʾlláh, and in a Tablet revealed by the Tongue of Merciful extolling
> their great virtues, He likened them to “angelic couriers.” He also revealed
> a Tablet of Visitation for the martyred believer, in the course of which

“No one should be disturbed since God has said,

In His Kitáb-i Aqdas for all creation:
“ ‘O people, when the Sun of My Beauty has set,

And My heavenly Temple is hidden from all eyes.
“ ‘All must arise for the triumph of My Cause,

Remain assured and raise its banner the world over.
“ ‘There was a wisdom in My Manifestation, and a wisdom also in My disappearance,

None will this wisdom comprehend save God Himself.’
“Therefore must we become united in His Cause’s spread,

We must become united both in outward seeming and within our hearts.
“For teaching and triumph of the Faith we must be as one body,

Instill a new spirit by this Call into the temple of the world.
“Eleven were the Disciples of Jesus Christ;

After the passing of God’s Spirit they gave healing to world’s dwellers.
“Praised be God at present our number is several thousand,

All enlightened by the eﬀulgence and the Writings of Bahá.”
Thanks be God’s that we are all beneath the Most Mighty Branch’s shade,

The Branch of that Ancient Stock and the wave of that Ocean of Grace.
Remain constant and assured in this mighty Cause,

Patient in this tragedy, thankful in adversity.
‘Andalíb regrets that ere this tragedy struck

He did not drink a cup borne by death’s angel!

Four months after [the slaying of ] Karbaláʾí Hasan Khán, the martyr-

The Passing of Zahrá Bagum

> In the year AH 1307 [1889], the passing of the holy leaf Zahrá Sultán
> Bagum, the sister of Khadíjih Bagum, took place. From the beginning
> of her life in the Cause she sustained great suﬀerings and immense hard-
> ships, one hour of which none other could have withstood, so vehement
> were they in their intensity. What manifold angst she endured at enemies’
> hand and what adversities she bore from unrelenting foes! For years she
> longed to see her only child, [Núriʾd-Dín], and not a night passed that
> she did not shed bitter tears over her separation, nor was there a day that
> she was not moved to weep over what had befallen her.220 Her sole con-
> solation was the favors of the Blessed Beauty as communicated through
> His trusted courier, Shaykh Salmán. In accordance with the wishes of
> the Blessed Perfection, after the passing of Khadíjih Bagum, that exalted
> noblewoman resided in the Blessed House of the Báb for some seven
> years, until her benevolent soul took its ﬂight to the Abhá Kingdom and
the exalted paradise on Wednesday, 15 of Safar [11 October 1889].

Her sacred remains were carried in circumambulation of the House of
> the Báb and then interred next to her sister’s. . . . A Tablet [of Baháʾuʾlláh]
> revealed in honor of the sacred leaf, Maryam-Sultán<36>, the wife of Áqá
> Mírzá Áqá Afnán, bears eloquent witness to the faith and certitude of
> that brilliant lamp of ﬁdelity and that essence of constancy. That Tablet
> of Visitation is quoted in its entirety in these pages that the reader may
> discern her spiritual attainments:

Several of Baháʾuʾlláh’s Tablets addressed to him are in INBMC 51:441–47,
> nos. 446–54. A description of this twin martyrdom is given in Mázandarání, Táríkh
Zuhúruʾl-Haqq, vol. 6, pp. 874–76.

As noted earlier, in order to protect the believers of Shíráz, Núriʾd-Dín left Iran for
more than 16 years and lived ﬁrst in India and then in Egypt.

O ye Leaves of My Divine Lote-Tree! Upon ye be the Glory of God, the
Lord of both worlds.

O ye fruits of My Tree of Bounty! Upon ye rest the Light of God, the
Luminous, the Radiant, the Eﬀulgent!

O ye remnants of My Afnán. The Sadratuʾl-Muntahá in the Supreme

I swear by the righteousness of God! Thine aﬄictions and all that hath

> of a certainty that a station is ordained for thee that, were its glory to be
> disclosed to an extent less than the needle’s eye, all would abandon that

the Throne.

The oppressors and the wayward of the world, following their fancy, are

wonder for all the peoples.

> Most Great Name amongst mankind, rest upon thee O thou dayspring of
> ﬁdelity, who hast been mentioned by the Tongue of Abhá in the Prison
City of ʿAkká.

I bear witness that thou didst hearken unto the summons from the earli-

> and didst seize the cup of divine knowledge and didst drink of what was
> proﬀered therein by the hands of bounty and grace. Thou art the one

Beginning and the End.

May the ﬁrst light dawning and shining from the horizon of God’s bounty

Blessed art thou O my handmaiden! And blessed too are whoever hath
sought thy grave and hath visited thy resting-place and hath striven after
[p.305]          nearness unto God, and hath made mention of that which the Supreme
Pen hath mentioned of thy aﬄictions and calamities.

CHAPTER ELEVEN

EVENTS OF EARLY 1890s

> After Zahrá Bagum’s passing, the Blessed Beauty granted permission to [p.306:1]
> Áqá Mírzá Áqá Núriʾd-Dín to bring his family and kin from Shíráz [to
> Port Said, Egypt] and in their company to journey to the Holy Land. In
> accordance with His command, the Afnán wrote to Áqá Mírzá Áqá<53>,
> the celebrated son of Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí Afnán, in Shíráz and
asked him to arrange the family’s immediate departure.

Thereupon, the holy leaf Maryam-Sultán Bagum arranged for the mar-
> riage of Áqá Mírzá Jalál<75>, her second son, and placed him in charge
> of the protection and maintenance of the Blessed House of the Báb in
> Shíráz. The remainder of the household, that is, Hájí Mírzá Buzurg<76>,
> Hájí Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh<71>, Hájí Mírzá Diyáʾ<72>, Hájíyyih Tubá
> Bagum<73>, Hájíyyih Zívar-Sultán, who was the mother of Áqá Mírzá
> Hádí Afnán<96>, together with two attendants, Áqá Muhammad-
> ʿAlí Káshání and Hájí Subráb, departed on Friday, 24 Safar AH 1308
[9 October 1890].

From Búshihr, we sailed for Port Said and then to the Holy Land. At
> that time, the present writer was only fourteen years of age. The leader
> of our travel party was my brother, Hájí Mírzá Buzurg, who was sixteen
> years old.

Martyrdom of Murtidá

> During this interval, Muhammad-Taqí Mírzá, the Ruknuʾd-Dawlih, was
> appointed governor-general of Fárs and came from Tihrán to Shíráz. By
> then, the celebrated Murtidá had been in prison for ﬁve years. When in
> AH 1310 [1892] the news of the Blessed Beauty’s ascension had reached
> Fárs, Murtidá—that singular thrall of his Divine Beloved—lost all restraint
> and begun to lament and sob most intensely. This detail was reported to
> Siyyid ʿAlí-Akbar [Fál-Asírí] who congregated with certain other ʿulamá of
> the period, including Shaykh Ahmad Shánih-Sáz, Mullá Ahmad Mahallátí,
> Shaykh ʿAbduʾl-Jabbár, Shaykh Táhir ʿArab, and Mírzá Hidáyatuʾlláh Dast-
> Ghayb. Collectively and unanimously, they signed a fatwá for Murtidá’s
> martyrdom in the presence of the Ruknuʾd-Dawlih, stating, “You must

> slay him this very day.” Having the required religious ruling in hand, the
governor-general ordered the martyrdom of that wronged-one.

It was a blistering summer afternoon that day. The executioner went to
> the dungeon to retrieve the prisoner and to accompany him to Maydán
> Túp-Khánih222 for the discharge of the sentence, which was for the pris-
> oner to be blown from the mouth of a cannon. Upon seeing his victim,
> the executioner informed that brave lover of the ﬁeld of sacriﬁce of his
> expected fate and in chains extracted him from his cell. At the prison
> gate, Murtidá paused and, with utmost delight and serenity, removed
> his hat and presented it to the executioner, saying, “Of all the worldly
[p.310] possessions, I have but this hat. As a reward for bringing me this most

> wonderful tiding, I wish to present it to you as a gift!” Then, with the
utmost aﬀability, he handed his oﬀering to the executioner.

Soon that wronged-one was brought out to the Maydán, where a
> multitude had gathered to witness the event and a cannon was readied.
> Murtidá asked for water. Thinking that he wished to have his last drink
> of water, the executioner brought him some.223 That love-intoxicated soul
> took the water and with it performed his ablutions and then stood facing
> the Holy Land [ʿAkká], and freely and with a resonant voice recited his
> obligatory prayer, followed by the chanting of a long prayer. Thereafter,
> he turned to the executioner, saying, “I have completed my duties. You
must now discharge yours.”

As is customary, the executioner placed a short stool in front of the
> cannon-mouth, placing that wronged-one with his back to the gun, and
> he was about to tie him with ropes, when the latter said, “There is no
> need to tie me. Tying is for thieves, wrongdoers, and highwaymen. Indeed,
> I have been yearning for this day and this blessed hour! My sole request
> is that you place me facing the cannon that I may see it discharged.”
> On hearing that true lover speak so bravely and with such constancy of
> purpose, the executioner and the multitude of people were overcome with
marvel and astonishment.

As requested, the executioner placed Murtidá facing the cannon. Upon
> ﬁring, the entire area was ﬁlled with the din of the roaring gun, and the
> cannon ball tore its target to pieces, scattered throughout the city-square.

The only recognizable part was his blessed head, which the heartless

Since Imám Husayn had been refused water during His ﬁnal moments, it is custom-
ary in Iran that victims are given water before their execution.

> executioner collected and paraded through the city in order to win alms
and gifts from the shopkeepers and the merchants.

[Moved by the bravery of Murtidá] that very day several people declared
> their allegiance to the Faith, including such personages as Áqá Sultán-
> Muhammad Khán Qahrimání [the champion]; Ghulám-Husayn Kúlih-
Kish [the porter]; Khán-Ján Duzdalishny; and a number of others.

Of the ʿulamá who had refused to sign and seal the fatwá for Murtidá’s
> martyrdom were Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí, the Mujtahid, and Hájí
> Shaykh Yahyá, the Imám-Jumʿih, both of whom ranked among the equi-
table and charitable citizens.

On the day that they blew Murtidá from the mouth of a cannon,
> Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí, the Mujtahid, who was a most virtuous
> and principled man, sent words to Siyyid ʿAlí-Akbar [Fál-Asírí] to the
> eﬀect, “Siyyid, do you discern what you have done today? The cannon’s
> roar caused half the city to become Bábí! Indeed, you served the sacred
religion of Islam and these people!”224

The area where Murtidá was martyred is now known as the Bágh
> Millí [the national park] and is ﬁlled with most ﬂourishing shrubs and
> vegetation, most delightful ﬂower gardens, and pleasing cypress, pine,
> and a variety of trees. Every spot reddened by the sacred blood of that
> lover, or marked by a piece of his body, has now witnessed the blossom
> of a ﬂower or a thriving tree, testifying to his longing for union with his
> merciful Beloved. Indeed, over the area of his martyrdom, the Bánk Millí
> [National Bank] is now raised.225

The Arrival of Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís in Fárs in AH 1313 [1895]

> After attaining the presence of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá in the Holy Land and gaining
> indescribable spiritual insights and manifold celestial understandings, Hájí
> Abúʾl-Hasan Mírzá, known as Hájí Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís, arrived in Shíráz by
> way of the port of Búshihr.226 He resided temporarily in Shíráz for several
> months before proceeding [ﬁrst to Isfahán and then] to Tihrán.

Since during his ﬁrst sojourn the weather in Shíráz had been particularly
> vivifying and the condition of Fárs most agreeable, he decided to return
> and settle for a longer period. He established a beﬁtting home, and initially
> the distinguished ʿulamá openly and warmly welcomed him.
[p.315]    The venerable Hájí Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís established his classes at Masjid

> Naw, near the [Shrine of ] Siyyid Mír Ahmad Sháh-Chiráq, which is a
> spacious and vivifying area, and there he would preach and deliver sermons.
> Truly and in all fairness, he was singular in eloquence and the ability to
> preach and teach from pulpits and at other public gatherings. Often it
> was witnessed that he delivered a discourse on a single theme for some
> four hours, completely sustaining the interest of his audience. All his
> sermons were aimed at the ediﬁcation and awakening of the people, to
> the point that those among his seminary students endowed with discern-

> Gradually, through the circulation of these notes, all citizens were greatly
> attracted to his lessons. During the morning hours, he would have his
> classes at his own residence where a large group would receive tuition.
> Several among his foremost students recognized the truth of the Faith
and numbered as his conﬁdants.

Áqá Mullá ʿAbduʾlláh Fádil, surnamed Rafíʿ-Badíʿ, whose suﬀerings and
> services were mentioned earlier in this narrative, was greatly attracted to
> the honored Shaykh upon ﬁrst meeting him and discerned spiritual attain-

Departure of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Núriʾd-Dín

> After sixteen years away, in accordance with ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s instructions,
> Núriʾd-Dín left Egypt for Shíráz and to meet en route with the late Áqá
> Mírzá Muhammad-Hasan [Mírzáy-i Shírází], the Hujjatuʾl-Islám [the Proof

> other chronicles, it is propitious that it be narrated in these pages so that
> kind mention is made of that singular steward of the world of humanity.
That story and the reasons behind the meeting are as follows.229

In the year AH 1312 [1894],230 [Sáhibih-Sultán Bagum], the mother
> of Áqá Siyyid Muhammad-Husayn Afnán, together with her daughter
> [Fátimih-Sultán Bagum<42>], who is the mother of Muvaqqaruʾd-Daw-
> lih<99>, visited the ʿAtabát. [In the course of their visit], they went to
> the residence of the esteemed Mírzá Hujjatuʾl-Islám in order to introduce
> themselves to him.

A diﬀerent translation of this interview formerly appeared in Balyúzí, Eminent
> Bahá ʾís in the Time of Bahá ʾuʾlláh, pp. 252–60. A summary is in Mázandarání, Táríkh
Zuhúruʾl-Haqq, vol. 6, pp. 1013–15.

Núriʾd-Dín’s letters from Búshihr are extant and are dated AH 1311 [1893]. There-
fore, most likely “1312” is a copyist error, and the actual date is AH 1311.

[p.325]       After the exchange of customary formalities, the mother said, “I am the

> wife of the late Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim<11>, and this is my daughter.
We ask your special blessings and favors.”

> “Which Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim?” he asked.
> “The maternal uncle of Áqá Mírzá Áqá<24>,” she replied.
> “Which Áqá Mírzá Áqá?”
> “The son of the late Mírzá Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín.”
> Then he remembered who it was and said, “The Áqá Mírzá Zaynuʾl-
ʿAbidín who [lived] near the gate of the Masjid Jámiʿ?”

> “Yes,” she replied, and he was overjoyed.
> “Where is Áqá Mírzá Áqá now?” he then asked.

“He was living in Egypt, but it appears from what he has written that
he now intends to return to Shíráz.”

“Do you know whether he has already traveled and reached Shíráz or
not?”

> “He has not arrived as yet.”
> “How much longer are you intending to remain in the ʿAtabát?”
> “We will stay for perhaps ﬁfteen more days, and when we have com-
> pleted our pilgrimage to the ʿAtabát and the sacred city of Najaf, we will
once again attain your presence and then return to Búshihr.”

“When you return to Búshihr, if you ﬁnd that Áqá Mírzá Áqá has
> already passed through that town and is on his way to Shíráz, then let
> it be. However, if he arrives while you are in Búshihr, please say to him
> from me: ‘Be sure to come to the ʿAtabát and visit me, for it has been
> many years that I have been deprived of meeting members of my family.’
> And if you leave Búshihr before he arrives, leave a message for him with
a trustworthy person that it is imperative for me to see him.”231

The days of the pilgrimage of those two ladies at the ʿAtabát drew to a
> close, and they went to bid farewell to the Hujjatuʾl-Islám. They said to
> him, “We are taking our leave today.” He urged them once more not to
> forget his message to Áqá Mírzá Áqá and to ensure that when he came
> to the ʿAtabát, he would come and see him.

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh adds parenthetically: (The Hujjatuʾl-Islám had family ties with the
> Afnán, that is to say their fathers were paternal cousins, and he was also closely related to
> the father of the Báb. It was for this reason that he was trying to arrange the meeting.)

Meeting Between Núriʾd-Dín and Mírzáy-i Shírází

> After completing their pilgrimage, the ladies returned to Búshihr, and on
> the very same day the ship carrying the Afnán arrived at Búshihr. They
> met each other, and the ladies conveyed the message of the Hujjatuʾl-
Islám. My father related:

> I was very hesitant whether I should go and visit or to forego such an
> intention. I thought about it a great deal. Eventually, I decided that it was
> best for me to go. The same ship took me on to Basrah, and from Basrah I
> traveled to Baghdad. I sent a missive before the Hujjatuʾl-Islám saying, “In
> conformity with your exalted wish, your good message has been forwarded
> to me in which you had stressed that when I reached the ʿAtabát I should
> visit you. I am now at Baghdad. Whenever you appoint a time, I shall come
and attain your presence.”

I sent the missive through one of the ʿArab Baháʾís and instructed him
> to identify himself [as my messenger] and then deliver it. When the letter
> reached him and he realized I was in Baghdad, he sent the following reply,
> “O light of mine eyes! Dear and esteemed one! Your letter was received and
> read. Since at the present time there is much coming and going of pilgrims, [p.330]
> please remain in the Abode of Peace [Baghdad] for ﬁfteen days even though
> it may be an inconvenience to you. Then at the expiry of the ﬁfteen days,
> come here to the ʿAtabát that we may meet. I am very eager to meet that
light of mine eyes.” The same messenger brought this reply to me.

After seeing this response, I remained in Baghdad, according to the
> instructions, for ﬁfteen days. At the culmination of that time, I set out to
> Samarra with a number of the ʿArab Baháʾís. Upon our arrival, the ʿArabs
found a place for us to stay, and we settled there.

The following day I called on the honored Mírzá and found an old man
> with a radiant face, sitting with pillows around him on which he was resting.
> The people who were being admitted to his presence would kiss his hand,
> sit in his presence for an hour, and then be dismissed. Like the others, I
> went forward, kissed his hand and introduced myself. He looked at me
> and inquired after my health. He only asked, “Where are you staying?” I
> did not know, but the ʿArabs who were with me gave the address and the
> location. He did not speak to me any further, nor paid any attention to us,
> and after sitting for more than one hour, I got up and again without adding
any expressions of aﬀection, he said, “Be under God’s protection!”

I was deeply annoyed at his ignoring me and was not in a good mood.

> “What a thing to do,” I said to myself. “I have caused myself a lot of trouble
> for no reason and have come here from Búshihr to no purpose.” I was very
> oﬀended. I arrived at the place where I was staying and said to my compan-
ions, “Let us make preparations to leave at ﬁrst light tomorrow.”

At the time of the adhán [call to prayer], which was two hours before
> sunrise, I was up and drinking tea, while the others were busy collecting our
> belongings. It was just getting light, and I was looking from the window

> into the street when I saw an akhúnd coming. When he reached the door
> of our house, he called out to one of the Baháʾís whose name was ʿAlí. ʿAlí
> went by the door to speak with him, and he said, “I have a message from
> the honored Mírzá, which I want to convey to Áqá Mírzá Áqá.” ʿAlí con-
> veyed the message, and I went over and spoke with the akhúnd. He said,
> “The honored Hujjatuʾl-Islám has asked that you come to see him alone,
without your companions.”

I decided to go, but my companions said, “We cannot let you go alone.

> Anything could happen.” “These thoughts are wrong,” I replied, “he must
> want to see me about something since he has specially sent for me.” In the
end my companions agreed, and I set out without them.

The name of the akhúnd was Shaykh Hasan, and he was one of the
> intimates of the Hujjatuʾl-Islám. I went with him until we reached the door
> of the house of the honored Mírzá, where I had been the previous day. But
he proceeded on around the corner.

“The house of the venerable Mírzá is here, O Shaykh,” I said to him;
“where are you going?”

“This is the bírúní,” he replied. “He has instructed that you be taken in
through the door of the andarúní, which is private.”

He went on another twenty paces and opened a door. In the corner of
> the hallway there was a room. He opened the door and held up the curtain.
> I went in and found his honored Hujjatuʾl-Islám, as on the previous day,
> with cushions around him, lying down. I greeted him, and he replied. Then
> he said to Shaykh Hasan, “Go brew some tea and bring it. No one is to
> be permitted to come here, for it is ﬁfty years since I have seen any of my
> relatives. I want one hour free from interruption to be with him. Even the
> children are not to be permitted.” After giving these instructions, he said
further, “Also, close the door.”

And so Shaykh Hasan closed the door and left. Then he opened his arms
[p.335]          and embraced me. He wept copiously, and from his condition I began to

> weep too. He sat me down next to him and poured out expressions of
aﬀection and favor.

“I know that you were annoyed at the way we met yesterday and were
> displeased. I realized that you were angered. What can I do with such people?
> What can I do? It was for this reason that I sent Shaykh Hasan to you in
the early morning to bring you here so that I can meet you.”

> At this moment, Shaykh Hasan brought in the tea.
> “Leave it and go,” he said. “Áqá Mírzá Áqá will pour the tea.”
> Shaykh Hasan put down the tray and left. I poured some tea and oﬀered
> it to him. He said, “You drink it.” I declined but he insisted, and so I drank
> the tea. He ordered me to ﬁll up the same cup again, and he drank from it.
> Then we began speaking. He asked a few questions about where I had been
during these years, what I had heard, and which persons I had met.

> “What sort of persons?” I asked.

“Persons who have put forward claims and have caused controversy—that
is to say, people with new ideas,” he said.

I replied, “In AH 1296 [1879] when I traveled from Shíráz, I went
> to Bombay where I occupied myself in trading. Here I made friends and
> associated with Iranian and foreign merchants. I met all types of people,
> and we would discuss every kind of topic. For example, I met Hájí Muham-
> mad-Ibráhím Yazdí, who is known as the Muballigh, and he spoke of many
> important matters. When I considered what he said and weighed his words
justly, I could not refute them.”

> “Where did you go after Bombay?” he inquired further.

“In AH 1305 [1887], I went from Bombay to Egypt, and I remained
> for some time in Port Said and Cairo engaged in trading where I came in
contact with all sorts of people.”

“Where did you go from there, where did you live, and whom did you
meet?” he yet asked.

It suddenly occurred to me, from his questions, that perhaps he wanted
> to extract a confession from me and cause me trouble. But I thought about
> this and seeing that there was no one present but he and I, I thought it
> unlikely that he was planning anything. So I decided to answer his ques-
tions with wisdom.

“For a time I went to Beirut and visited some important people from
> among the notables such as Áqá Muhammad-Mustafa Baghdádí and others
like him.”

> “What did they speak of ?”
> “They spoke of the new Cause,” I replied, “and whatever they said was
> supported by proofs and evidences from the verses of the Qurʾán and the
> Hadíth of the Prophet [Muhammad] to such an extent that no fair-minded
> person could deny it. And so I wanted very much to see your honor so that
> I could ask you what my position is according to religious law and what my
moral and religious duty is. Should they be accepted or rejected?”

“O light of mine eyes! The One exalted God has created the parts of the
> body for the use of His creation that mankind may utilize each of them.
> Thus, for example, eyes are created for seeing, ears for hearing, the tongue
> for speech, hands for touching, and feet for walking, but He has created
> the heart for knowing and recognizing Him and has ordained it as the seat
> of His eﬀulgence. He has said, ‘The heart of believer is the throne of the
> All-Merciful.’ Since it is thus, Satan has no place there. And, therefore, if
> this Cause is not from God, it will have no eﬀect on the heart and being of
> a man. Whatever the heart accepts and understands must, without doubt,
come from God—it will not err.”

When I heard this reply of his, I became more conﬁdent and felt free
to speak.

“Now, the light of mine eyes, where did you go from Beirut?” he [p.340]
asked.

> “I went to ʿAkká.”
> He smiled and asked, “O light of mine eyes! What did you see and ﬁnd
there?”

> “From what point of view do you mean?”
> “From both the material and spiritual points of view.”

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 131                                                                   7/10/2008 3:45:24 PM

“From a worldly point of view, I found such majesty, power, authority,
> command, and might that no king or emperor could hope to rival. And as
> for the spiritual realm, whatever you have heard of the previous Manifesta-
> tions of God or have seen of the Books or signs of those Essences of Being
> and Manifestations of Might you will ﬁnd a more complete and a hundred
> thousand times more mighty demonstration in this Holy Personage. For
> example, from the Holy Prophet [Muhammad] the verses of the Holy Qurʾán
> were revealed in thirty sections [ juz’ ], gradually over a period of twenty-two
> years.232 From this Holy Being, that is to say, Baháʾuʾlláh, in one month ten
> times the Holy Qurʾán is revealed with the utmost precision and eloquence
> for the world of humanity. And it is such that no fair-minded man can
refute it nor produce the like of it.”

“It is indeed so, if one be fair-minded,” he replied. “I myself have seen
> some of these Writings, and they cannot be compared with the verses of
previous revelations. No, they are much more eloquent and profound.”

Then respectfully I asked, “When did your exalted self come to this
conclusion?”

He smiled and said, “Do you want to hear a confession from me then,
my son?”

“God forbid! It is only because Your Eminence is the most learned of
> mankind that I wanted to know so as to increase the certainty in my own
heart.”

“Light of mine eyes! Since you want to know, I will tell you. I was a
> young man, studying at Isfahán, when His Holiness the [Primal] Point graced
> that town with His presence. I was present at a gathering with the Imám-
> Jumʿih and the theological students at the house of Manuchihr Khán, the
> Muʿtamiduʾd-Dawlih. They were asking Him scientiﬁc questions of every
> sort, [testing His knowledge] and He was answering each one convincingly
> and with the utmost eloquence so that all of us fell into an astonished silence.
> Then one of the theological students asked a scientiﬁc question, and He
> gave a full reply. That student showed himself to be unfair and recalcitrant.
> His answer to that person decided me, and I was convinced and understood
> everything. Nor did I allow this understanding to wane. Whatever of His
> verses and commentaries came to hand, I read, and they renewed my inner,
> spiritual being. No doubt has since then entered my mind, and this outward
> glory that God has granted me is on account of the fact that I approached
this matter fairly and accepted this Cause.”

After hearing these words and becoming completely assured about that
> holy man, I said, “Now that this blessed Cause is manifest and proven to
> Your Eminence and the reins of control over millions of the Shiʿite sect are
> in your able hands, if you consider it advisable, you could make this matter
> public so that the people will be saved from ignorance and error and will
> enter the highway of right guidance.”

The Ministry of Muhammad lasted some twenty-three years.

“What are you saying, my son? These people are not fair-minded. Are
> my attainments higher than those of Mullá Husayn Bushrúʾí or Áqá Mírzá
> Muhammad-ʿAlí Bárfurúshí [Quddús], and Akhúnd Mullá Muhammad-ʿAlí
> Zanjání [Hujjat] and the others? They would have done the same with me

> the meantime, I was able to perform such services that were I to tell you
> of them, you yourself would testify that it was right for me to conceal the
matter and help the Cause.”

> “I would like to hear of the assistance that you have given,” I said.

“In AH 1301,233 a number [of the believers] were arrested by Kámrán [p.345]
> Mírzá, the Náyibu’s-Saltanih, in Tihrán and kept in prison in harsh cir-
> cumstances for two years. Every day they were interrogated, and matters
> were made very diﬃcult and agonizing for them. I wrote to Násiriʾd-Dín
> Sháh saying, ‘Why have you without any reason or my fatwá, caused such
> diﬃculties and harm to befall them? It has been due to you that this Faith
> has spread among the peoples and countries. The Apostle of God [Muham-

> and persecutions have strengthened the Cause of these people [Baháʾís]. You
> must certainly, as soon as my letter arrives, send for the prisoners, be kind
> to them, and set them free. And henceforward, do not cause anyone harass-

> Sháh summoned all the prisoners, gave them an Ashrafí [gold coin] each

> ʿAlí Qazvíní, and other important persons. That was one of the services I

> known as Afghání, was planning some mischief in Istanbul. He had inter-
> polated some material into the Kitáb-i Aqdas and had inserted some rub-
> bish of his own into that book. Among the things that he had added was
> that the mosques of Islam should be demolished and razed to the ground.
> Mecca should be destroyed, Medina pulled down, and some other things.
> He translated this into Turkish and gave it to Sultán ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd so that
> the Sultán might become angry and mischief might result therefrom. Sultán
> ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd wrote an account of this book to me and asked me what
> should be done. I replied, ‘You have no right to interfere in such matters.
> Whoever has done this has done so out of spite. Send all such books to
> me. After investigating the matter, I will decide what is to be done with

> Perhaps one hundred letters in all, and to each one I have given an answer
and silenced its author.”

After hearing these words from the honored Hujjatuʾl-Islám, I said,
> “Truly your help and assistance for this Cause have been inestimable and
> are worthy of praise. Of a certainty you have penned a will. It is good that
> you elucidate this matter in your will so that after you, others would know
their duty.”

“I have written in detail. We must see if the inheritors will publicize my
will.”234 Then he said, “When will you be leaving?”

“My sole intention was to meet you,” I replied. “I have no other busi-
ness here.”

“Then it is better if you go soon, since, when you arrived in the Abode
> of Peace [Baghdad] some mischief-makers came and said something to

> Baháʾí teachings]. I gave them reply saying, ‘It is Áqá Mírzá Áqá, one of
> my cousins. I have personally invited him to visit the Holy Places and to
> come and meet me. Do not interfere in this matter.’ ”
[p.350]                   We embraced warmly and said farewell and I left. As I left the house, I

> found the ʿArab Baháʾís gathered, worried, around the house of the vener-
able Mírzá. When they saw me, they were relieved.

“We became worried because you took so long. We were thinking all

the house of the honored Mírzá waiting for you.”

“That was not necessary,” I replied. I returned with my friends to our

The records of the Afnán family indicate that a copy of this will found its way to

TROUBLES IN ÁBÁDIH

Arrival of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Núriʾd-Dín

Furúghí in Shíráz

> A few months later, Áqá Mírzá Mahmúd Furúghí arrived in Shíráz by

> Muhammad Aʿlamuʾl-ʿUlamá, [known as] the Mujtahid Búshihrí and the
> Thaqatuʾl-Islám, who was a brother of Áqá Najaf Isfahání,237 and [in the
> course of their conversations,] he grew cognizant that Furúghí was a Baháʾí.
> As a handsome prize, this news was brought by him to the circle of the
> ʿulamá of Shíráz who were told, “A prophet of these people [Baháʾís] has
> arrived in Shíráz.” He provided exact details, and each of the ʿulamá was
> told of the depth of Furúghí’s knowledge and achievements, and was duly
> warned of his presence in the city.

Under the feudalistic system of the time, the Afnáns were among the aﬄuent

In Baháʾuʾlláh’s Writings he is referred to as “the son of the wolf.”

Unable to contain his zeal and enthusiasm, on his arrival the celebrated
> Furúghí began organizing many Baháʾí gatherings. Each day, a large
> number of the friends would assemble in various homes [to partake of
> this spiritual sustenance]. Soon, reports of these activities were sent to the
> ʿulamá, which prompted them to cause sedition. They immediately sent
> a message to the Ruknuʾd-Dawlih, stating in essence, “A teacher of these
> people [Baháʾís] has come to Shíráz and is deceiving the citizens [into
> joining the Baháʾí Faith]. He must be summarily arrested and punished as
> a lesson to others.” The governor-general was thus compelled into issuing
orders for Furúghí’s arrest.

The news of the ʿulamá’s schemes and the collusion of the governor
> reached Furúghí that day as he participated in a large Baháʾí gathering
> in the home of Áqá Muhammad-Hasan Khayyát [tailor]. After consulta-
> tion with the friends, it was decided that, in the company of a trusted
> guide, Furúghí should leave Shíráz for Ábádih. For this mission, Mash-
> hadí ʿAbbás, a keen, righteous and agile man, was chosen, and that very
night they left the city.

The governor, however, learning of their exit, immediately sent several
> oﬃcers in their pursuit, and on the way to Zarqán he was intercepted
> and apprehended. Furúghí was brought back to the governor’s orchard,
> and the Ruknuʾd-Dawlih was informed of his arrest. The governor came
> from the Ark to the orchard where the captive was kept. He was, however,
> charmed and won over by Furúghí and ordered his Tufangdár-Báshí [the
> chief gunner] to serve as the host for the captive.
[p.355]    While a guest in his home, Furúghí succeeded in teaching the Faith

> to his host, who was ﬁlled with love and admiration for the Cause. On
hearing this, the Ruknuʾd-Dawlih was enraged [but took no action].

One day, in the course of a conversation with Furúghí, the governor
> voiced an insult [to the Baháʾí Faith], which instantly caused his guest to
> become infuriated, rebuking him, “Know well, O governor, that I possess
> a mighty serpent, and should it be unleashed, it will devour you and your
> Ark.”238 He spoke these words with such authority that the Prince was
> thoroughly overcome with fear and apologized profusely, assuring him that
> no oﬀense was intended. Thereupon, Furúghí begun to recite many verses
> of the Qurʾán and the Prophet’s Traditions that further served to deepen
> the admiration of the governor for his eloquence and learning.

The symbolism is that of Moses’ admonishment to the Pharaoh.

During one of my pilgrimages to the Holy Land, Furúghí was also
present, and he related for me:

> One day in my absence, the Prince Ruknuʾd-Dawlih asked Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís
> if he were acquainted with me. The Shaykh denied knowing me.239 Later
> when the Shaykh was not present, the governor asked me if I knew Abúʾl-
Hasan Mírzá Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís. I replied, “Yes, I know him well.”

It so happened that on the following day, we both were in the presence
> of the Prince, and he remarked, “O venerable Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís, it is puzzling
> that you deny knowing Áqá Mírzá Mahmúd, when he states categorically
> that he knows you well. What is the meaning of this?” I quickly understood
> the wisdom exercised by the Shaykh and without a moment’s hesitation,
> interjected, “The esteemed Skaykhuʾr-Raʾís had stated that he does not know
> me because he has forgotten our previous meeting. However, if he would
> recall, one day we both were attending my father’s class, and in the course
> of conversation, the Shaykh misspoke a word that made my father angry,
> causing him to throw his water-pipe at him. Therefore, it stands to reason
that he would not remember me.”

The Shaykh promptly realized that I had spoken in a manner to cover his
> mistake and replied, “Yes, of course! You must forgive my lapse of memory.
> You are the son of the late Shaykh Muhammad Dúgh-Ábádí.240 Now I
> remember. Your late father was a man of unsurpassed merits and knowledge,
> and the esteemed Furúghí is likewise truly unparalleled in erudition and
> scholarship. But, alas, such men are not appreciated in this country and are
> only known to the keenest of men.”
> In all events, for a period of time, Furúghí stayed in Shíráz at the home
> of the Tufangdár-Báshí. Eventually, the Prince informed him one day
> that he was free to leave town in whatever direction he wished. Furúghí
> replied, “I desire to go to Tihrán by way of Ábádih. The governor oﬀered
> a mount for the journey, which Furúghí politely refused. Then the Prince
> ordered his treasurer to give him ﬁfty tumáns, stating, “Kindly use this
> money towards your journey’s expenses.” “Although I have suﬃcient funds
> for this purpose, it is unseemly to reject Your Excellency’s generosity,” and
> with that he took the money but immediately distributed it among the
> Prince’s attendants, farrashes, the cook, the Tufangdár-Báshí, and some
> other servants. Fifteen qarán was left, and he recognized, “Báshmáqchí [p.360]

Since ʿAbduʾl-Bahá had instructed Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís to conceal his faith, he had

One of the foremost early Bábí–Baháʾís, he was a survivor of the battle of Shaykh

> has also sustained troubles on my behalf,” and oﬀered him the remaining
> sum. The Ruknuʾd-Dawlih was ﬁlled with wonder and admiration by this
display of benevolence and magnanimity.

At last, he left accompanied by two of the Prince’s soldiers who were
instructed to provide protection as far as Zarqán. Furúghí related for me:

> These two soldiers only had a single gun between them, and en route I
> heard them comment to one another, “This Akhúnd is a Bábí, and it is
> best that we kill him from behind.” On hearing their whisper, I realized
> they were set on murdering me. When we reached a brook, I asked my
> attendant, Mashhadí ʿAbbás, to prepare tea, and I began to converse with
> the two soldiers. While they were busy talking, suddenly, I seized the gun,
> held the barrel while threatening them with its butt, saying, “If you dare,
> just come closer! You may think that I am just an akhúnd and that you
> can kill me. But you are wrong; I am a Khurásaní and can defend myself
against a hundred like you!”

Realizing that I had the upper hand, the soldiers begun to apologize
> for their misdeed, and when we reached Zarqán and met the believers, I
> returned their gun and gave them a gratuity.

Mischief in Ábádih 241

> After a sojourn of one night, Furúghí departed for Ábádih and arrived at
> the home of the Afnán.242 His entry coincided with the wedding of [my
> eldest brother,] Áqá Siyyid Áqá<74> to the daughter Dáʾyí Husayn,243
> and the honored Furúghí presided over the marriage ceremony, which
> was carried out in accordance with Baháʾí laws. However, on hearing
> this news, [Mullá Muhammad-Husayn,] the Imám [Jumʿih of Ábádih
> and a brother-in-law of Dáʾyí Husayn,] thought he was slighted and

The Ábádih incident is also told by Áqá Mírzá Qábil Ábádiʾi in his valuable unpub-
> lished history, Táríkh Ábádih va Tavabiʿ, (147 pages in the author’s hand, chapter “The
> Sixth Event”, pages 40–55), henceforth referred to as Qábil. There are some additional
> notable details provided by Qábil, as well as some diﬀerences between his version and
> the present document by Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh. To the extent practical, these are noted
> below. For a biography of Mírzá ʿAbbás Qábil, see Sulaymání, Masábíh Hidáyat, vol. 2,
pp. 182–234.

Qábil, p. 40, notes that in the company of Núriʾd-Dín, Furúghí arrived at Ábádih
> on 17 Dhiʾl-Qaʿdih AH 1313 [30 April 1896]. On the same day, Qábil himself arrived
> from Yazd. On page 41, Qábil notes that Furúghí had just returned from the Holy Land
> and in his meetings, urged the friends to steadfastness in the Covenant and avoidance of
Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí and other opponents of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá.

Qabil, p. 2, notes that he was a son of Karbaláʾí Muhammad-Taqí and surnamed
“Báʾyí” [enduring] by Baháʾuʾlláh.

to his oﬃce.244

For several days thereafter, most enjoyable and beﬁtting [Baháʾí] gather-
> ings and assemblies were organized in Ábádih when, suddenly, the news
> of Nasiriʾd-Din Sháh’s assassination reached that region.245 Simultaneous
> with this, Siyyid Yahyá Khán Tafríshigar, the Hishmat-Nizám, and two
> regiments under his command arrived [from Tihrán] in Ábádih on their
> way to Shíráz. The akhúnds seized this opportunity and persuaded the
> Hishmat-Nizám to act against the Baháʾís. Consenting to their request,
> he ordered his men to encircle the residence of the Afnán and to arrest
> the household, considering this seizure would yield great beneﬁts. They
> intended to arrest Áqá Mírzá Áqá Núriʾd-Dín Afnán; Áqá Siyyid Áqá
> Afnán; Áqá Mírzá Diyáʾ Afnán; Furúghí; Hájí ʿAlí Khán; Dáʾyí Husayn;
> Mírzá ʿAtauʾlláh Khán Sirájuʾl-Hukamá [the lamp of physicians]; Áqá
Mírzá Husayn; Qábil [Ábádiʾi]; and some other believers.246

Fortunately, the Imám’s sister [Bíbí Bagum Ján] overheard their discus- [p.365]
> sions and quickly informed her sister, the wife of Dáʾyí Husayn, “[Our
> brother] the Imám and the Hishmat-Nizám are planning to arrest the
> Afnán and a number of other [Baháʾís]. It is best for them to leave quickly
and not be here when the gunmen arrive for this purpose.”

That day, it so happened that Furúghí, the Afnán, and some others
> were the guests of Hájí ʿAlí Khán. At once, Dáʾyí Husayn’s wife informed
the Afnán of the mischief that was brewing.

The soldiers came to Dáʾyí Husayn’s home and failing to ﬁnd the believ-
> ers, were led by the rabble to Hájí ʿAlí Khán’s residence. On gaining their
> destination, without any warning, two of the men entered the dwelling
> where they found the honored gentlemen [Baháʾís] gathered around a
> table in the midst of garden and Furúghí, with his striking ﬁgure and
> enchanting voice, occupied in chanting the Holy Verses. The soldiers noted
> that Mullá Husayn who was a brother of the Qádí, the Afnán, Furúghí,

Ábádih has had a checkered history of Baháʾí persecution. Many of these episodes
> are described in detail in Qábil. One early incident is told in Mázarandání, Táríkh
Zuhúruhʾl-Haqq, vol. 5, p. 93.

The monarch’s assassination by Mírzá Ridá Kirmání took place on 19 April 1896.

Qábil, p. 42, notes that the Imám-Jumʿih connived with a number of other clerics
> in presenting the Baháʾís as the Sháh’s murderers and as engaged in preparation of war-
> fare against the state. This accusation caused the Ruknuʾd-Dawlih to become particularly
> apprehensive of the situation. According to Qábil, the Hishmat-Nizám was ordered by
> the governor to remain in Ábádih to ensure the security of the region and if necessary,
> to seize and imprison the Baháʾí leadership.

> Hájí ʿAlí Khán, and Dáʾyí Husayn were present. They said to Áqá Mírzá
> Mahmúd [Furúghí], “Our master has summoned you.” However, Hájí
> ʿAlí Khán and Dáʾyí Husayn advised Furúghí not to heed their request,
> but that instead they would go with the men to determine what was
> being planned. Eventually, Hájí ʿAlí Khán and Dáʾyí Husayn convinced
the soldiers that they would go with them instead.247

When they arrived at the residence of the Hishmat-Nizám, he instructed
> his men to detain these two and to return for the arrest of Furúghí as
> well. The recruits carried out this order and disrespectfully and insolently
> brought Furúghí before their commander. Upon arrival, Furúghí spoke
> softly and conﬁdently, but as the Hishmat-Nizám was partially deaf, he
> did not understand his words and spoke in a harsh and impertinent tone.
> Noting that the Hishmat-Nizám was particularly hearing-impaired and
> unaware, Furúghí produced a letter in the hand of the Ruknuʾd-Dawlih
> ordering all the oﬃcials and chieftains of the region to show utmost
> respect and consideration towards the person of Mírzá Mahmúd [Furúghí].
> Seeing this command, the Hishmat-Nizám ordered two of his soldiers to
> accompany the Furúghí out of city for a distance of two days’ journey
> and to abandon him there. Thus, he was expelled from Ábádih, and once
> having reached two days’ journey north of town, the two soldiers stripped
> him of his possessions, including his clothing. For two days and two
> nights, desolate, hungry, and cold, Furúghí was stranded in the outlying
mountainsides of Ábádih.

Hájí ʿAlí Khán and Dáʾyí Husayn were freed after being compelled to

ﬂed to Yazd.249

The Imám continued to pressure the Hishmat-Nizám into further

Qábil, p. 43, gives the date of this event as 1 Dhiʾl-Hajjih AH 1313 [14 May
1896].

Qábil, p. 47, indicates that these two men remained in the prison for the duration
of the troubles. The same source, page 50, indicates that the ﬁne was 300 tumáns.

Qábil, pp. 45–47, gives a detailed account of a severe beating that he received dur-
> ing this period. Further, in pages 49–50, he gives the details of his presentation to the
> Hisámu’s-Saltanih on 22 May, implying that he must have been in prison for the duration

> Mírzá Áqá and his sons, Áqá Siyyid Áqá and Mírzá Díyá’. Once they are
> arrested, you can readily reduce all the rest and win their possessions.”
> Exceedingly pleased with this plan and proposal, the Hishmat-Nizám left
its execution to the Imám.

Three hours into that night, Bíbí Bagum Ján, the Imám’s sister, again
> quickly took the news to her sister, the wife of Dáʾyí Husayn, “Our perﬁdi-
> ous brother, the Imám, has plotted against Áqá Mírzá Áqá, his sons, and
> your husband. In secret I have come here to inform you so that tomorrow,
> they may not be here.” On hearing this intelligence, the wife of Dáʾyí
> Husayn proceeded to the residence of the Afnán and informed him of
> the fate that awaited them. Áqá Mírzá Áqá asked where could they hide
> since he was not familiar with the town. She responded, “Our neighbor,
> Áqá Hasan, though not a Baháʾí, is a virtuous man, and his house has a
> turret in which you can hide for a while.” Gaining his consent, she then
spoke with Áqá Hasan’s wife who also agreed to this arrangement.

At dawn, the Afnán along with Áqá Siyyid Áqá, Áqá ʿAbdul-Hamíd
> [Gandum-Pákkun], and Dáʾyí Husayn took refuge in the above-mentioned
> turret, but the Afnán’s wife [Maryam-Sultán Bagum], and his daughter

> perplexed as to what awaited them.

The Ordeals of the Afnán Women

> At the next daybreak, on the instructions of the Hishmat-Nizám, the
> soldiers led by ʿAskar Khán and his gunmen proceeded to the house of
> Dáʾyí Husayn. They loudly knocked on the door. ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd’s wife

> continued knocking, but when the ladies did not open the door, they
> entered from the neighbor’s adjoining rooftops. Overcome with fear, the
> younger lad of the Afnán, Áqá Mírzá Díyá’, who had not accompanied
> his father, rushed to the rooftop. Áqá Hasan’s wife noticed him, called
> him down, and had him concealed in the basement along with Áqá Mírzá
Husayn Khán.

Upon entrance into the residence, on the pretense of searching for the

> overtaken the house, the Afnán’s wife and daughter placed chadors over
> their heads, covered their faces, and content with the will of God, sat on
> a platform and busied themselves with reciting prayers for deliverance.

My mother related to me:
[p.375]          We were intensely immersed in our imploration and had remained so quiet

> that the soldiers and the rabble thought that we were actually men hiding
> under the cover of chadors. After the militia and ʿAskar Khán’s gunmen
> entered the house, the people of Ábádih, men and women alike, rushed
> inside as well, and it was only after repeated and forceful protestations by
> Dáʾyí Husayn’s household that the commander of the soldiers instructed his
> men to shut and bolt the main doorway and prevent any further unauthor-
ized entrance or exit.

Before they could shut the door, however, a thirteen-year-old black maid-
> servant of Dáʾyí Husayn, ran inside the house. As she was being chased by
> the gunmen who were intent on injuring her, she took refuge next to the
> Afnán’s daughter who was sitting next to her mother. The commander of
> the soldiers ordered his men to beat the young girl so they could learn from
> her the whereabouts of the fugitives. As enjoined, the rogues proceeded to
> beat the child, whose name was Shírín, with clubs and the butt of their
> guns while barking orders that she must confess the hiding place of the
> Baháʾí men. During a moment of relief, she threw herself on the knees of
> the Afnán’s daughter [Tubá], who, no longer able to endure this grotesque
> scene of injustice and unable to contain her indignation over the assailants’
> brutality, shouted back, “Why do you beat this wretched child and make her
> suﬀer so? If you are charged to take our lives, then shoot us and be done!
> What simpleton fools are you to imagine that the men would divulge to us
their hiding place?! Shame on you! Pity on you! Leave this child be!”

On hearing the Afnán’s daughter speak so forcibly, the soldiers withdrew
> and informed their commander that the two under the chador were wom-
> enfolk and decided it was best to leave the house.

> ʿAskar Khán returned to the Imám and reported, “Our search of the
> residence failed to discover the [Baháʾí] men, and brutalizing their women
> produced no result either. What do you suggest?” The Imám stated, “The
> sole remedy is to capture, torture, and torment the wife and daughter of
> Áqá Mírzá Áqá who would then tell us the men’s whereabouts. If you do
not do so, then our purpose will not be achieved.”

After they had resolved to carry out this plan, once more, the Imám’s
> sister overheard their conversation and proceeded to the house of Dáʾyí
Husayn to warn her sister of the impending fate awaiting her guests.

However, on reaching the house, she discovered the entrance was locked

> in order to gain admittance and share the news with you, that you might

> “Even if we wanted to ﬂee, doors are locked and the roof guarded by
soldiers! No path is left for us to take our ﬂight.”

Finding all avenues closed to them, at this hour of great peril they

looting and plundering the rooms and the houses.

Being deeply frightened, Dáʾyí Husayn’s twelve-year-old son, Áqá Jalál,

by the name of Fúj, so he would sew the injury.

lad’s injuries were self-inﬂicted, which seems rather unlikely.

Qábil, p. 53, gives the fee as ten tumáns.

> my fee is paid in full, I will not tend to the wound.” Suddenly, the
> desolate mother remembered an exquisite cashmere shawl [that the soldiers
> had not managed to ﬁnd and loot] and gave that to him. [Having been
> paid in kind,] the doctor thereupon attended the wound and stitched
the cut.

Having heard all the commotion as well as the wailing and the sobbing
> of the mother, the neighborhood’s womenfolk came into the house and
> gathered in the courtyard. In the midst of her own agonies, Dáʾyí Husayn’s
> wife, however, had the presence of mind to see a perfect opportunity for
> the wife and the daughter of the Afnán to escape. She told them, “This is
> a good break to change your chadors and leave among the many women
> gathered here. No one will recognize you.” [The Afnán’s wife] inquired,
> “Where are we to go?” “With my maidservant,” she answered, “you can
> go to the home of Dáʾyí Husayn’s second wife.” “If it is a safe place,”
> she said, “then we will go.” “There is no other choice,” was the response.
> Quickly she asked them to replace their chadors for older ones common
among the villagers and to change their shoes for local wear.

Meanwhile, she appealed to the commander of the soldiers to evacu-
> ate the house of the neighborhood’s women so that she could look after
> her injured son. The commander, having pity on the woman, ordered
> his men accordingly. As all the women were leaving, the Afnán’s wife
> and daughter, together with a trusted maidservant [named Tájí], escaped,
> and thus the invisible hand of the Providence delivered them from the
> clutches of bloodthirsty wolves. As bidden by Dáʾyí Husayn’s wife, they
> proceeded in haste to the home of the second wife of Dáʾyí Husayn—a
> non-Baháʾí woman.
[p.385]    In the intervening time, after they had helped the injured lad and

> emptied the house of the neighborhood’s women, unable to ﬁnd the
> Afnán women, the soldiers returned to the Imám informing him of the
> day’s events and the escape of the Shirází women. The Imám instructed
> them, “Dusk is upon us, and therefore it is best for the soldiers to leave
the home [of Dáʾyí Husayn] and to resume the search in the morning.”

Upon arrival at the home of the Dáʾyí Husayn’s second wife, the women
> were informed by their hostess, “Since I fear the soldiers’ reprisals and
> destruction, I can only provide shelter for you until tomorrow morning.
> Two hours before sunlight, you are to leave this home.” “We are strang-

> we also do not wish to bring any discomfort, or worse yet, danger, upon
> you. God will assuredly watch over all of us. We only ask that you direct
> us to a place of safety.” “I do not know where you can go. Go anywhere

> you please,” was the response of their hostess. The guests were particularly
infuriated by this reaction.

Three hours into the night, the daughter of Dáʾyí Husayn, who was
> the wife of Áqá Siyyid Áqá<74>, arrived with her maidservant and the
> three-year-old son of Mírzá Jalál<75>, the second son of Áqá Mírzá Áqá
> Afnán. This child had accompanied them from Shíráz and was extremely
> attached to his grandmother and paternal aunt and upon seeing them,
> began to cry, “Dear aunt! Since I did not see you when you left, I thought
> the soldiers had taken you.” After much eﬀort, eventually they were able
> to calm the child. The four women and the child were wondering where
> to go next when their hostess came and pressed them to leave by saying,
> “Have you thought about what you will do? Before tomorrow’s sunrise,
> you must leave my house.” Dáʾyí Husayn’s daughter asked, “Wife of my
> father! You insist on our leaving, but where should we go?” She responded,
> “I do not know. Go wherever. I will not allow good Muslims to fall into
trouble over the fate of you Bábís!”

Sent by Dáʾyí Husayn’s [Baháʾí] wife to inquire after them, at last Tájí
> arrived and upon asking of their condition was told by the Afnán’s wife,
> “The lady of the house has told us to leave two hours before sunrise. We
> do not know what we must do.” Seeing their wretched condition, that
> trustworthy maidservant [i.e., Tájí] had promised that by the will of God,
> she would ﬁnd them a place of safety. She left and returned after two
> hours informing them that she had secured the home of one of the farm-
> ers for their stay. She pledged to come again two hours before dawn to
> accompany them there, and with that, she returned home and informed
the wife of Dáʾyí [Husayn].

Consequently, in the middle of the dark night, dressed in their old
> chadors and shoes and without informing the house-owner, they left for
> their newly located haven. The appointed house was at the end of an
> orchard on the outskirts of the village. This house had an upper chamber,
> with a single entrance, where grapes were dried to make raisins. Such [p.390]
> oven-like rooms have low ceilings, are kept extremely dark, have no air
> circulation, and are most unpleasant. In this room, they were to remain
> with a three-year-old boy who did not comprehend the gravity of the
> situation. Once more, Tájí impressed upon them not to make any noise
> lest they be heard by the neighbors. Locking the door from the outside,
she left them to await their destiny. My mother related:

> The room was so dark that we were unable to see one another and could not
> calm the child who was terriﬁed of the darkness and wanted to scream. He
> kept asking us to let him go out to play as he would on other days. When

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 145                                                                       7/10/2008 3:45:26 PM

> he saw the door locked, he grew more in agitation. All we could do was to
> tell him, “Please lower your voice. If the gunmen hear us, they will come,
> seize us, and take us away.” With this, he would be suﬃciently frightened
> to remain quiet for a little while. However, after a short time, once more,
> he would plead with us to open the door just so he could see some light,
> promising that as soon as the soldiers appeared, he would close it again.

> Indeed, it is heartrending to imagine the plight of those women and
> the depth of the poor child’s fear, coupled with not even knowing what
> may have befallen their innocent men! If one could envision such a
> scene and if one were endowed with a measure of fairness, one would
> be ﬁlled with remorse over their condition. “The curse of God be upon
the wrong-doers.”252

Hiding some bread, cheese, and a jug of water under her chador, by
> lunchtime the trusted maidservant, Tájí, returned and was able to alleviate
> their anxiety over the fate of their men by informing them that they had
> taken refuge in the mountain caves with some other Baháʾís and thank-
> fully were safe and well. God willing, I will tell the story of this mountain
journey of the Baháʾí men at a later occasion.

Yet again she left, locking the door from the outside and taking the
> key with her, and the women had to contend with the darkness and the
> heat of the attic, and a frightened child, though they were relieved over
the fate of the men.

Tájí returned an hour after dusk and opened the door, saying, “With the
> cover of darkness, it is now safe for you to come out to sit on the rooftop
> and breathe some fresh air.” As they sat on the roof, the farmer came by
> and greeted them warmly, stating, “From morning until now, I have been
> most apprehensive—almost at death’s door—fearing that someone would
> discover your presence on this property. It would be best for you to leave
tonight for another location, as it is unsafe to remain here.”

Once more, the women were bewildered as to where they might take
> refuge. Despite all the hardship it presented, they had been satisﬁed
> with this dark and suﬀocating attic, but even this was now being denied
> them. The wife of the Afnán prayed and thought hard what to do, and
> eventually it occurred to her that perchance Áqá Mírzá ʿAtaʾuʾlláh Khán,
> the Sirájuʾl-Hukamá, would provide a sanctuary for a few days until it
> became clear what the Almighty had decreed for them.
[p.395]    As such, once more Tájí was sent on this errand, and she briefed the wife

of Áqá Mírzá ʿAtáʾuʾlláh Khán of the situation. In turn, she conveyed the

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 146                                                                                 7/10/2008 3:45:26 PM

> details to the Sirájuʾl-Hukamá and asked, “The Afnán’s wife has conveyed
> a message wishing to take refuge here. How am I to respond?” “Of course,
> they may!” stated the Sirájuʾl-Hukamá, “Reply at once that they are most
> welcome. My house is like their very own. Here they will be safe, and no
> harm will come to them, as the people of Ábádih desperately need my
[medical] services and will show no disrespect toward my guests.”

Hearing this reply through the same trusted maidservant, dressed in the
> old chadors again, the ladies set out for the home of the Sirájuʾl-Hukamá
> where they were received with the utmost aﬀection and made comfortable
> at long last. When they inquired after the [Baháʾí refugee] men, their host
described their situation thus:

> After they had spent the day in Áqá Hasan’s turret, some of the friends from
> Dirghúk [village] led by ʿAbbás Khán armed themselves and came to Áqá
> Hasan’s residence about seven at night. They attained the presence of the
> Afnán and informed him, “Your stay in this house is no longer advisable.
> We will escort you to the hill-country where no one can interfere with us
> or cause harm.” Consenting to their plan and placing their reliance in God,
> Áqá Mírzá Áqá, his two sons, Áqá Siyyid Áqá and Áqá Mírzá Díyá’, as well
> as Dáʾyí Husayn and Áqá Mírzá Husayn Khán, proceeded with ʿAbbás Khán
> and other armed believers to the mountainous region of Dirghúk. Once
> other Baháʾís, such as Hájí ʿAlí Khán, learned of their whereabouts, they
also joined them in this new location.253

Áqá Mírzá ʿAbbás Qábil was seized on that very ﬁrst day and severely
> beaten with sticks. He was released after two days and two nights of
> imprisonment, whereupon he ﬂed to Yazd. However, the friends from the
> surrounding regions of Ábádih are all armed, standing guard around the
> mountain. They have pleaded with the Afnán [Núriʾd-Dín], “Kindly allow
> us to go into Ábádih and deal with the Imám as we should and punish
> him and his men as they deserve.” Notwithstanding, Áqá Mírzá Áqá has
> prevented them, enjoining on the believers to manifest kindness, saying,
> “Do not permit the least unlawful act to occur. Baháʾuʾlláh has charity to
> all. Whatever the foes may do, we must do the opposite: when they injure
> us, we must give them remedy; when they feed us bitter draught, we must
> oﬀer them sweet honey. They are unaware; they are ignorant; they are heed-
> less; they are unable to distinguish good from error. You must ﬁx your gaze
> upon the exhortations of the Blessed Beauty. Even a small conﬂict authored
> by you will enable them to regard you as the source of all ills. Never, never,
> occasion a wrong, as it will ruin the eﬀorts of all these years.”254 Through
> such appeals, he has managed to calm and still their rage.                     [p.400]

Qábil, p. 47, indicates that the entire Baháʾí communities of Ábádih, Dirghúk, and
Himat-Ábád ﬂed into the mountain fastness.

Qábil, p. 47, indicates that the leader of the armed Baháʾís, Áqá Haydar-ʿAlí Himat-
Ábádí, and ʿAbbás Khán Dirghúkí appealed to the two Baháʾí prisoners, Dáʾyí Husayn

Furúghí’s Fate

> After Mírzá Mahmúd Furúghí was compelled to leave Ábádih, the soldiers
> accompanying him robbed him of all his clothing and possessions, left
> him stranded two stations outside the town, and triumphantly returned.
> Furúghí wandered in the wilderness and the mountains for two days and
> two nights—unclad and hungry—until ﬁnally with the greatest diﬃculty
> he found his way back to Ábádih. At nighttime he arrived in town and
> proceeded directly to the home of Hájí ʿAlí Khán, where he discovered
> the front gate locked and, therefore, with enormous struggle managed
> to gain entrance through a brook that ran through the property’s wall.
> Thoroughly drenched in mud and dirt, he came inside and was met by the
> widow of Hájí Muhammad-Ismáʿíl Dhabíh255 and her daughter who was
> the wife of Hájí ʿAlí Khán. They immediately took him inside, provided
> him with a change of clothing, and washed and dried his garments while
> he ate. He then inquired after the Afnán, Hájí ʿAlí Khán, and the rest
> of the friends and upon hearing of their whereabouts insisted in joining
> them that very night in the mountains. Subsequently, led by a trusted
> attendant, he set out for the mountain locations where the Baháʾís had
gathered. The Afnán used to relate:

> We were all exceedingly elated with the arrival of the much-esteemed Furúghí
> and circled lovingly around him. For us, it was as if the mountain had
> turned into the throne of sovereignty and the air now had the savor of the
> everlasting paradise. Such depth of ethereal spirituality stirred within us that
> indeed it is indescribable. For a whole day and night we were in his presence
> in the mountains. In the course of our consultations, however, we decided
> that it was best for Furúghí to proceed to Yazd. Therefore, I purchased for
> him one of Áqá Husayn Dirghúkí’s horses and arranged for other provisions
for his journey. He left in the company of an able servant.256

Subsequently, we consulted and agreed that staying indeﬁnitely in the
> mountains would not serve any purpose and that a potent remedy was
> needed. As such, we decided unanimously to cable the details to the oﬃce
> of the Prime Minister in Tihrán as well as the Ruknuʾd-Dawlih in Shíráz.

> and Hájí ʿAlí Khán, for permission to attack and free them by force. However, noting
> that ʿAskar Khán and one hundred of his men guarded the prison round the clock, the
Baháʾí captives discouraged this eﬀort.

vol. 1, pp. 101–3.

Qábil, p. 55, gives the date of Furúghí’s arrival in Yazd as 28 Dhiʾl-Hajjih [10
June].

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 148                                                                                  7/10/2008 3:45:27 PM

> The text of these cablegrams were prepared and dispatched to Ábádih where
> the Baháʾí womenfolk of Ábádih, Dirghúk, and Himat-Ábád were asked to
proceed collectively to the Telegraph Oﬃce to dispatch these cables.

About three hundred Baháʾí ladies assembled at the Telegraph Oﬃce
> and presented the cable to the Zál Khán Shírází, who was the head of the
> Telegraph Oﬃce and was a particularly evil and vicious man, and also a
> devoted ally and collaborator of the Imám and the Hishmat-Nizám.257 He
> had taken the telegram and collected the corresponding fee, but had actu-
> ally refused to transmit the cable. Instead, he had sent a vituperative report
against the believers, ﬁlled with falsities.

Realizing Zál Khán’s nefarious intentions, the womenfolk informed us
> in the mountain strongholds. I said to the believers, “Now that Ábádih is
> proving a disappointment, we will try through Yazd.” I wrote a detailed
> account of the happenings to Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Taqí Afnán, the

> this letter, it was explained that numerous attempts had been made to cable

transmitted false reports.

Upon the arrival of our account in Yazd, Hájí Vakíluʾd-Dawlih informed
> the Prime Minister in Tihrán, who in turn cabled the Ruknuʾd-Dawlih
> in Shíráz with instructions to instantly summon the Hishmat [-Nizám]
> and his men to Shíráz and to prevent the rabble from mischief.258 The
> Ruknuʾd-Dawlih complied fully with these instructions and commanded

> had no other accomplices, and once more peace and tranquility returned

> Once the believers in the mountain shelter were informed of the restoration
> of order in the city, the Afnán, Dáʾyí Husayn, and Hájí ʿAlí Khán returned

Qábil, pp. 47–48, indicates this event took place on 7 Dhiʾl-Hajjih [20 May 1896]
> and that the group of 500 Baháʾí women from Ábádih and Himat-Ábád were led by the
Sirajuʾl-Hukamá, ʿAbbás Khán’s wife, and Hájí ʿAlí Khán’s wife.

Qábil, p. 54, indicates that he arrived in Yazd on 16 Dhiʾl-Hajjih [29 May] and
> briefed the Vakíluʾd-Dawlih of the events. Thereupon, a telegram was sent to Tihrán, and
on the following day a cable was received from the Prime Minister’s oﬃce:

> Response to the citizens of Ábádih:
[Attention of ] the illustrious Ruknuʾd-Dawlih:

Why has Mírzá Siyyid Yahyá Khán, [the Hishmat-Nizám,] the commander of the
> Hamadání forces, through the instigation of the mischievous Imám-Jumʿih of Ábádih
> and in collaboration with the scoundrel Zál Khán of the Telegraph Oﬃce, caused
> such tumult in Ábádih? And why have they caused the citizens of that region to be
> scattered on the mere accusation of being Baháʾís, and plundered their possessions
> and properties, slain or injured a number of them, and yet again extracted ﬁnes from
> some others? Of a certainty, Siyyid Yahyá Khán must move at once from Ábádih,
> and all the conﬁscated properties and possessions must be returned to their rightful
> owners and peace must be re-established.

> to Ábádih and reclaimed their homes, while Áqá Mírzá Husayn Khán,
> ʿAbbás Khán, and some others continued to remain in the mountains.
> The Afnán proceeded directly to the residence of the Sirájuʾl-Hukamá,
> where other members of his family were tarrying, and after expressing
> their deep gratitude to their host for his hospitality, they regained their
own dwelling.

About the same time, on his way from Tihrán to his newly appointed
> oﬃce in Búshihr, the esteemed Prince [Hájí Abúʾl-Nasír Mírzá] Hisámuʾs-
> Saltanih259 [II], a son of Sultán-Murád Mírzá, the Hisámuʾs-Saltanih [I],
> came to Ábádih.260 Upon arrival, because of their previous friendship and
> association, he went to the residence of Áqá Mírzá Husayn Khán, known
> as Báqh Kuláh-Farangí261 [the European-hat orchard], a most pleasant and
> verdant orchard. Upon hearing of his whereabouts and the reason for his
> sojourn to the mountains, the Prince sent word that he should return
> to Ábádih. Áqá Mírzá Husayn Khán, therefore, returned and described
> for the Prince all the brutalities of the Hishmat-Nizám, the atrocities
> and savageries of the Imám, the Qádí, and Zál Khán of the Telegraph
> Oﬃce. Moved deeply on hearing these details, the Prince immediately
> cabled the Oﬃce of the Prime Minister in Tihrán, requesting measures to
> be taken in order to restore security to Fárs—a request that was granted
immediately.262

As such, the troubles in Ábádih were concluded, and peace was restored
> once more. After a few more months’ stay, the Afnán went to Yazd to
> complete some business transactions with Hájí Mírzá Áqá Afnán.263 Some
> time later, he returned to Shíráz.264

He had received the same title as his father, and therefore the notations “I” and
> “II” are used to diﬀerentiate between the two. For a biography, see Bámdád, Sharh Hál
Rijál Iran, vol. 1, pp. 70–71.

Qábil, p. 48, gives the date of his arrival as 9 Dhiʾl-Hajjih [22 May 1896].

Not to be confused with a name of the famous building in Shíráz that for a long
period served as the residence of the governor-general of Fárs.

Qábil, pp. 50–51, states that with departure of the Hisámuʾs-Saltanih II from Ábádih,
> the Hishmat-Nizám decided to renew mischief and planned on the murder of Qábil.
However, the latter was informed of this plot and ﬂed to Yazd in the middle of night.

A.Q. Afnán maintains that this journey took place prior to the events of Ábádih
(private communication, December 1997).

Malmirí, Khátirát Malmirí, p. 126, indicates that Núriʾd-Dín remained in Ábádih
for a year.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN

PROFILE OF TURMOIL: SPRING 1903

The Journey of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán, [Surnamed] Núriʾd-Dín, from

Shíráz—His Second Journey to the Holy Land

> In AH 1316 [1898], ʿAbduʾl-Bahá summoned the Afnán to the Holy [p.409:7]
> Land. He departed from Shíráz in the company of Maryam-Sultán
> Bagum, Túbá Khánum, and Mírzá Díyáʾuʾd-Dín and arrived in the Holy
> Land. They had the bounty of dwelling for a month under the canopy [p.410]
> of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s favors where each day they drank their ﬁll from the
> chalice of their Beloved’s inﬁnite muniﬁcence and partook of the honor
of being in His presence.

At the conclusion of the month’s stay, congruent with ʿAbduʾl-Baháʾs
> command, the Afnán went to Port Said, as Hájí Mírzá Buzurg and this
> servant [Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh] were residing in that town. My mother, sister,
> and brother, Hájí Mírzá Díyáʾuʾd-Dín, accompanied my father, the Afnán.
In that town, we were engaged in commerce.

We remained in Port Said for three years when, once more in accordance
> with ʿAbduʾl-Baháʾs command, we returned to Fárs to serve and protect
> the Blessed House of the Báb. Our entire family was permitted to travel
> [again] to the Holy Land and to remain there for some ﬁfteen days. After
> acquiring spiritual sustenance, consonant with His wish, we returned for
a brief period to Port Said and thence proceeded to Shíráz.

When the friends in Shíráz were informed of the safe transfer of the
> Báb’s sacred remains from Tihrán to the Holy Land and their interment
> on Mount Carmel, the celebrated Hájí Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís penned a poem
> in AH 1318 [1900] which marked that blessed date and submitted it to
> ʿAbduʾl-Baháʾs presence.265 This oﬀering won His high praise. . . .266

The remains of the Báb were interred in His permanent Shrine on Naw-Rúz 1909.

> For the history of events leading to this interment, see, Rabbani, “Eﬀorts to Preserve the
Remains of the Báb: Four Historical Accounts.”

The text on page 412 quotes ﬁve lines of this poem that are not rendered into
> English in the present translation. The concluding verse gives the date of this event, 1327

[1909], as the numerical value of the phrase “Hadíratuʾl-Qudsí.”

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 151                                                                                   7/10/2008 3:45:27 PM

152                              chapter thirteen

Similarly, at the time when the arch—Covenant-breaker [Mírzá Muham-
> mad-ʿAlí] had hoisted the standard of violation, Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís composed
> a missive in Arabic and a poem in Persian and sent them to ʿAbduʾl-Baháʾs
> presence as well. These two documents are truly enchanting, and upon
> their consideration, one perceives the depth of certitude, faith, and purity
of intent of this peerless and evanescent believer. . . .267

Filled with joy and spirit, the Afnán arrived in Shíráz on 18 Shaʿbán
> AH 1319[30 November 1901], with this servant and my brother, Hájí
> Mírzá Buzurg, [and the womenfolk of our family,] in his company. We
> attained the presence of the friends of the Merciful, and regular weekly
> gatherings were organized, where all the believers would come together

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh’s Injury

> It was during this time that this servant was aﬀected by an illness that
> rendered me bedridden for almost four months. Various physicians were
> brought in, such as Áqá Mírzá ʿAbduʾlláh Rahmat, who prescribed vari-

> Holy Land, induced an acute depression. Previously, for twelve years,

> where my spirit would be rejuvenated through His unceasing favors. But
> now I found myself in the destitute land of Iran, ﬁrmly in the grasp of
> bloodthirsty wolves, suﬀering profoundly, and being deeply saddened and
agitated because of it.

One day after taking my medicine, I ventured to the roof of the Blessed
> House [of the Báb] and stood on the same side of the residence that the
> sacred orange tree planted by His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb]
> was located. That sanctiﬁed tree was in full bloom. I stood there that
> perchance through the fragrance of the sacred orange tree my soul and

by Nabíl Zarandí:
I did not eat the [forbidden] wheat,269 O Beloved,

Then why expulsion from Thy Ridván?
If I partook some, it was out of ignorance,

I am guilty, remorseful, and repentant.
I am a ﬁsh far from water,

Consumed by Thy separation’s ﬁre.270

the brick broke into many pieces and I fell unconscious.

Discovered by my brothers, I was brought down to the courtyard
[of the House of the Báb] with my eye swollen shut. Immediately, [my

> a devoted Baháʾí. After examination he reported, “Currently, applying

not discernible.

Áqá Mírzá Husayn came to visit and examined my condition, and,

impaired.” Again, he repeated, “This is an absolute miracle!”

After investigation, it was determined that the assailant was the
> Khabíruʾd-Dawlih’s son from a Kurdish mother. He confessed to the
> act and said, “[Because he is a Baháʾí,] I hit him on purpose, hoping he
would go blind.”

During this period, I was unable to communicate with the Holy Land
> for forty days. After I had recovered to some degree, I wrote Áqá Siyyid
> Taqí Manshádí, apologizing for delay in sending missives and explained to
> him that the delay was because of an injury, describing a little of what had
> transpired. Manshádí took my letter to the presence of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá and
> described what had occurred. Immediately, from the heaven of His grace
> and bounty, an exalted and glorious Tablet was revealed in the honor of
this servant, which will beﬁttingly adorn the pages of this history:

> Shíráz. The illustrious Afnán of the sacred Lote-Tree, Áqá Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh,

He is God.

O thou oﬀshoot of the Tree of Reality! Thou hast been accepted at the

The Passing of Hájí Abúʾl-Hasan in AH 1320 [1902]

> In the year AH 1320 [1902], the passing of Hájí Abúʾl-Hasan, father of [p.425]
> Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán [Dihqán], occurred. During the early
> part of this history, and then later, his loving mention was made exten-
> sively, and the excellence of his character, the depth of his devotion, and
> the troubles he sustained were noted. Now I wish to record the incident
and injury that led to his passing, as an example of devotion unto all.

The Hájí had a particular aﬃnity towards [my father] the Afnán and
> twice weekly, that is, on Mondays and Fridays, would come visit the
> Blessed House of the Báb and meet the Afnán. At that time, the Hájí
was more than ninety years of age.

One day, his journey passed by the vicinity of the home of Siyyid ʿAlí-
> Akbar Fál-Asírí, whose malicious deeds were mentioned in the course of
> the martyrdom of the illustrious Murtidá and the incident of Muham-
> mad-Qásim Khán, and are recorded in the pages of history. The henchmen
> under the command of the Siyyid saw the Hájí [Abúʾl-Hasan] and, after
> having severely abused that bright and spiritually resplendent old man,
> took him to the Siyyid’s home. On being informed, that unenlightened
> Siyyid came forth to the front-court of his dwelling and with his cane
> brutally injured the victim. [As a result,] the Hájí became unconscious
> and was thrown into the streets by the same coarse mercenaries. Several
> farrashes of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk happened upon the Hájí and, recogniz-
> ing him, carried this old man to the home of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-
> ʿAlí Khán and left after receiving a gratuity. The household immediately

attended to his injured father.

From that date, his son prevented him from leaving the residence, and

> he passed away and was buried in Háﬁziyyih.

Withdrawal of Shuʿáʿuʾs-Saltanih

> In the same year, another incident occurred that caused general commo-
> tion and resulted in insult to Hájí Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís in the name of the
Cause and this community, and the details are these:

A year into the governorship of Prince Malik Mansúr Mírzá, the
> Shuʿáʿuʾs-Saltanih, in Shíráz, while aﬀairs were unfolding most harmoni-
> ously, certain insidious elements were eager to ﬁnd an excuse to instigate
> trouble and gradually began provocations.273 The citizens were divided into
> two factions: a large contingent who, in support of the Prince, assembled
> at the telegraph oﬃce, and a second group, led by Muhammad-Ridá Khán,
> the Qavámuʾl-Mulk, centered in Masjid Naw and [Masjid] Sháh-Chiráq,
> intent on mischief. Hájí Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís, for reasons of certain central
> authorities’ consideration, and also by virtue of his kinship, championed
> the Prince. The much-respected Shaykh Yahyá, the Imám-Jumʿih, together
> with a number of the seminarians, nobles, merchants, and shopkeepers
> congregated in the telegraph oﬃce and raising tents and shelters, camped
> in that location. The other ʿulamá, such as, Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím Mahal-
> látí, and certain others, followed the Qavám and made Masjid Naw their
place of assembly.

This incident was a perfect excuse for nefarious constituents to fuel the
> ﬁre of uproar and enmity and to poison people’s thoughts [against the
> Baháʾí Faith], and this they particularly achieved through the sermons that
> Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís had delivered, the texts of which were transcribed and
> disseminated broadly. They contrived a plot to noise abroad that “Hájí
> Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís is a Bábí, aiming to corrupt the masses and lead them
> away from the straight path into waywardness and ignorance!”

Bámdád, Sharh Hál Rijál Iran, vol. 4, pp. 156–57, indicates that Malik Mansúr
> Mírzá, being among the most aﬄuent Iranians with an enormous annual stipend, planned
> to seize Bazaar Vakíl and the shops around the Karím Khán’s quarter. However, these
> belonged to the Qavám family, who induced a popular uprising that resulted in the
> Prince’s being recalled from his post.

Using a large sum made available by Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the [p.430]
> Qavámuʾl-Mulk, and the religious rulings of Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím Mahal-
> látí and other ʿulamá, as well as the inﬂuence of the merchants and the
> rabble, they encouraged and provoked the people. Each day, gangs of
> youth, vulgar characters, and rabble carrying sticks, clubs, pistols, and
> guns would roam the bazaars and streets, and forcibly close any shop
> that was opened. They constantly incited all citizens to tumult and would
> not shy away from using unseemly language and insult to achieve their
> means. In addition, a group of Ághivlí and Bayát274 womenfolk armed
> with sticks marched every day through the city and shouted obscenities
> against Hájí Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís and the Prince, and would curse and insult
> them on allegation of being Bábís. They also would clamor and shout out
slogans, impelling and demanding the injury and slaying of all Baháʾís!

This tumult continued for nearly four months, during which time all the
> Baháʾís lost hope of life and possessions. At the beginning of the month of
> Safar AH 1321 [circa 29 April 1903], a telegraph announcing the dismissal
> of the Prince from the oﬃce was received from Tihrán. Disappointed with
> the turn of events, the Prince decided it best to conceal the news, since
> it would be a grievous stain on his prestige, and instead ordered the can-
> nons ﬁred [as a sign of celebration], proclaiming that Tihrán’s telegraph
> promoted him to a new appointment as an independent governor. Upon
> hearing the roar of the cannons, the opposition that had gathered in the
> Masjid Naw ﬂed, while the ʿulamá concealed themselves under their ʿabás
> and went into hiding in their own homes. None was left in the Masjid
> Naw and Sháh-Chiráq. Later that night, after it was determined that
> the adversary had vacated its position, the Prince, in the company of
Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís and his household and staﬀ, departed for Tihrán.

The following afternoon, on learning that the Prince was dismissed
> from the oﬃce and had quit the city, peace and tranquility became the
> norm. The Qavámuʾl-Mulk let it be known, “Our purpose was to eﬀect
> the impeachment of the Prince and the ousting of Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís, and
> none other. No one is permitted to accuse others of being a ‘Bábí’ or to
issue an insult!”

From Tihrán, the Prince Muhammad-Husayn Mírzá, the Muʾayyadu’s-
> Saltanih, who was the head of the telegraph oﬃce [and a Baháʾí], was
> appointed the city’s mayor, with Mírzá Ahmad Khán, the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih,
> as the governor-general.

The Governorship of ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih

> In the year AH 1321 [1903], the uproar of Isfahán and the incident of the
> Russian Consulate took place, which soon engulfed Yazd, and the details
> surely must have been recorded in the history of Isfahán and Yazd.275 The
> fury of that episode was also felt in Fárs. At that time, Mírzá Ahmad
Khán, the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih, was the governor-general.

[Ahmad Khán] was a powerful regent, and under his command order
> once again ruled throughout Fárs, as everyone was particularly apprehensive
> of his wrath. The governor himself would personally deliberate on all the
aﬀairs of the province.276

When the news of the occurrences of Isfahán and Yazd reached Shíráz,
> the governor increased his vigilance to ensure that similar acts were not
> perpetrated in his realm. In this regard, he had the conﬁdence and sup-
> port of: Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk; Habíbuʾlláh Khán
> Bíglar-Baykí; Prince Muhammad-Husayn Mírzá, the Muʾayyadu’s-Saltanih;
> Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán, the Amír-Panjih [commander] of the Farídání regiment,
> [known as the Muʿazamuʾd-Dawlih]; and Colonel Ahmad-Qulí Khán.

A.Q. Afnán states: “From the beginning of Rabíʿuʾl-Avval of AH 1321 [28 May–27

> June 1903], the clamor of malice and enmity was noised abroad throughout many towns
> of Iran. It that same year, more than eighty destitute Baháʾís were martyred in Yazd,
> and the earth of that region was reddened and ennobled with the blood of these souls.
> Contemporaneously, out of fear of the perﬁdiousness of Áqá Najafí and the treachery of
> Zilluʾs-Sultán, the friends of God in Isfahán took refuge in the Russian Consulate” (private
communication, September 1997).

Based on his father’s recollections, A.Q. Afnán writes (private correspondence,
September 1997):

> From the beginning of his regime, the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih had the custom that he would
> devote Saturdays to investigating the complaints of various Shírázís, such as merchants,
> nobles, and shopkeepers. The rest of the week, he would spend on other matters
> pertaining to the administration of the province. Since he was a capable, yet severe
> and heartless person, and was particularly known for his foulmouthed expressions,
> people were deeply frightened of him and would try not to create a circumstance
> that would require his intervention. His other custom was that all complaints had
> to be presented in writing, whereupon the text would be read aloud in his presence
> and he would order the immediate summoning of parties and an investigation,
> and then he would pronounce decisions. On occasion, he would delegate the task
> of inquiry to others, such as the ʿulamá or the dignitaries, who had to report their
> ﬁndings on the following Saturday, at which time, he would issue the ﬁnal ruling
> in the presence of both parties. He also had the habit of immediately enforcing
> his decision and punishing the guilty, and if he found the initial complaint to be
> invalid, often it was noted that he would force the petitioner to eat his entreaty and
> to receive a beating.

> These men were aligned with the governor in ensuring that no protest
would be aired.277

In the midst of this, reports of the events of Zarqán were received.

> That is, Akhúnd Mullá ʿAlí-Akbar Zarqání had provoked the populace
> of that town to attack and severely injure Ustád Ahmad Malikí-Dúz [the
> shoemaker] and to persecute other believers. When this news reached
> Shíráz, Áqá Mírzá Jalál Zarqání, son of Mullá ʿAbduʾlláh Biká’, who was
> previously mentioned in these pages, decided to protect the Cause. In
> consultation with ʿAndalíb and certain others, they wrote a petition to
> the governor-general beseeching equity, complaining of the suﬀerings and [p.435]
anguish of Baháʾís at the hand of unjust people.

This appeal was written without the Afnán’s knowledge and given to
> Áqá ʿAlí-Akbar Khádim278 [the attendant] to present to the governor. In
> the morning, the governor was at the Khúrshíd palace, and a number of
> the ʿulamá, merchants, dignitaries, and shopkeepers of Shíráz were present
> as well. Áqá ʿAlí-Akbar presented the envelope [containing the supplica-
> tion] directly to the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih, who handed it to his conﬁdant and
> private secretary, Áqá Mírzá Qásim Khán, the Ásifuʾl-Mulk, who was a
> brother of Mírzá Husayn Khán, the Muʿtamiʾd-Díván,279 and instructed
> him, “Read the letter and to inform us of the details, so we may address
the concern of the petitioner.”

After reading the content, the Ásifuʾl-Mulk was bewildered and decided
> it best to conceal the matter and therefore placed the missive back in
> the envelope, stating, “I will apprise Your Excellency later of this letter.”
> Growing impatient, the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih said stridently, “What is in the
> plaintiﬀ ’s letter and concern?” “It is a missive from the Baháʾís,” replied
> the Ásifuʾl-Mulk and then proceeded to brieﬂy outline the content. The
> ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih became cognizant of the nature of the complaint and
> wrote on the margin of the letter that it should be referred to Muham-
> mad-Ridá Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk. Further, he told Áqá ʿAlí-Akbar
> that the Qavámuʾl-Mulk would inform him of the decision.

Many of the upper echelon of the administrative machinery of Fárs were Baháʾís, and
> it continued that way throughout much of the Constitutional Revolution. ʿAbduʾl-Bahá
> conﬁrms the same in His 23 July 1912 talk, “. . . a Baháʾí may hold a political oﬃce and
> be interested in politics of the right type. Ministers, state oﬃcials, and governor-generals
> in Persia are Baháʾís, and there are many other Bahá’ís holding governmental positions . . .”
(The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 238).

One of the devoted Baháʾís of that era.

He was a Baháʾí, and as such, his brother, though not a believer, had a particular
aﬃnity for the Baháʾís.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 159                                                                                     7/10/2008 3:45:29 PM

Immediately, the governor summoned the Qavámuʾl-Mulk and stated,
> “If you know certain of these people [Baháʾís], admonish them that now
> is not the time to raise such issues. Prudence is necessary, not open asser-
> tion of the rights for Baháʾís!” In response, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk expressed
> his readiness to undertake the mission and subsequently returned to his
duties.

Certain insidious and evil-minded persons in that gathering had learned
> that the Baháʾís had submitted such a petition to the governor and as such
> launched tumult in the streets, neighborhoods, mosques, and other places
> of gathering. They commenced insult and slander [against the Baháʾí Faith]
> and spread the details of the occurrences of Isfahán and Yazd throughout
> the city. Additionally, they sent a missive to the governor, and using the
> Baháʾí petition and the freedom of the believers as an excuse, they raised
> the cry of “Our religion is lost!” All of this resulted in an unruly uproar;
> tumult reigned throughout Shíráz; and deplorable events were expected.

Meeting with the Qavámuʾl-Mulk

> On the evening of 4 Rabíʿuʾl-Avval [31 May 1903], the Qavámuʾl-Mulk
> sent word through his attendant, ʿAbbás Khán, a deeply devoted and
> enkindled Baháʾí youth and known as such to his master, the Qavám.
> That night, about one hour after dusk, ʿAbbás Khán came to the House
> of the Báb and informed Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán, “I bear the greetings
> and the best wishes of my master [the Qavámuʾl-Mulk]. He asked me to
> inform you, ‘Today at the Governorʾs Ark a common person280 submitted
> a petition to the governor in the name and over the signature of Baháʾís,
> requesting freedom [for the Baháʾí Faith]. The governor turned the matter
> over to me, and at your convenience, I wish to meet for an hour with
you at my residence in the city.’ ”

The Afnán replied to the message, “I am completely unfamiliar with
> this event and do not think Baháʾís would have sent such a petition or
> made such a request at a time when turmoil has engulfed the city. Per-

behalf, and you may disclose your wishes to him.”                            [p.440]

ʿAbbás Khán informed the Qavám, who designated the following eve-

hours later by the same messenger.

The following evening, 5 Rabíʿuʾl-Avval [1 June 1903], about an hour

exchange of pleasantries and inquiring after my father’s health, he said:

“I am well acquainted with [your brother,] Áqá Mírzá Jalál Khán [who

the House of the Báb was situated, and eventually passed away from these injuries.

> I were summoned into His presence, and for some two hours this bliss
lasted. The Tongue of Grandeur spoke thus:

> The Jaláluʾd-Dawlih has done what has caused the eyes of the denizens of
> the Supreme Concourse to shed tears of blood. Do you perceive the reason
> for his doings? The motive is that Masʿúd Mírzá, the Zilluʾs-Sultán, wrote Us

> ʿAlí Sayyah to bring. Among the things he requested of Us was to aid him
> with the Bábís to destroy his Sháh-Bábá.284 “Should You do this,” he wrote,
> “I will give You liberty, I will give You authority, I will support You, I will
> make amends for past atrocities.” This Wronged-One wrote him, “Discard
[p.445]                such thoughts. Praying for the Sháh is obligatory for you, all Iranians, and

> Us. We do not desire liberty, nor rule. Were We after leadership, what

trace of them or their rule will remain.

Consider this: In one single city and at the same location, two persons

Qurʾán 76:1. The full verse is: “Did there not pass over man a [long] space of time
during which he was a thing not worthy of remembrance?”

A.Q. Afnán has recorded that when relating this story his father would add: And

> I then related, “When Baháʾuʾlláh spoke these words, He also prayed for
you and asked for divine conﬁrmations on your behalf.”

On hearing this, Muhammad-Ridá Khán grew exceedingly happy and
with tremendous excitement, three times asked, “He prayed for us?”

“Yes, the One True God does not forget the deeds of anyone. God
> does not veil them. He conceals sins, but reveals our good and virtuous
doings.”

Afterwards, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk asked, “Are you aware of what has
> transpired in Isfahán and the tumult that rages in Shíráz? What sort of
> loutish person would send such a petition? And who would authorize
> such a deed? Now is not the time for such actions. I have exerted myself

> not able to remedy the situation, and what transpired took place. Now

> It is best for the more prominent among them to remain at home for a
while until these troubles have dwindled.”

I responded, “Of a certainty, your will and counsel will be ﬁrmly adhered

> and indeed the verse “And thou see the people enter God’s Religion in
troops,”287 has been realized there.

“Indeed, in America. I have a number of pictures of the American
believers.”

“The sacred blood of believers was shed in Iran, and its eﬀect stands

In all, our discussions lasted some two hours. Afterward, I asked per-
mission to take my leave, and in bidding me farewell, he said, “Kindly
[p.450] convey my warmest greetings to your father. I was deeply pleased by

Instigation of the ʿUlamá

> The day following, however, the residents of Shíráz began a massive
> altercation that included shutting all the shops in the bazaar for an
> extensive march, with accompanying shouted insults and curses through
> the streets, neighborhoods, and mosques.288 Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the

> held the oﬃces of Kalántar and Bíglar-Baykí, and the [Qavám’s] younger

> not tolerate mischief, and none among the vulgar and unruly citizens is
allowed to cause harm to the Baháʾís.”

Nevertheless, for three days the bazaars were closed and the ʿulamá
> and the rabble busy provoking malice and mischief. During this time,

> mad-Husayn Mírzá Muʾayyaduʾs-Saltanih, Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán Amír-Panjih,

A.Q. Afnán has recorded the following additional details from his father (private
> communications, August 1997): “The clergy in Shíráz, following the example of the
> ʿulamá of Yazd, commenced mischief and disturbances against the Baháʾís of the city.
> Some shopkeepers, encouraged by Siyyid ʿAlí-Akbar Fál-Asírí, his son Siyyid Muhammad,
> Shaykh Muhsin Qannád, and Shaykh Jaʿfar Mahallátí, closed their businesses in protest.
> The clergy ascended the pulpits and began insulting the Faith and provoking the religious
> fervor of the multitudes until a complete uprising against the Cause and the massacre of
all Baháʾís seemed inevitable.”

He served as a high-ranking military oﬃcer.

> and Habíbuʾlláh Khán Bíglar-Baykí, were in private conference in the
> governor’s oﬃce about ways to restrain the rabble and bring peace to

> [Baháʾís] to remain at home and not to attend their shops in the bazaar.
> Mírzá Muhammad-Jaʿfar Khán, who numbered among the faithful, sin-
> cere believers and who was a private secretary to Habíbuʾlláh Khán [the
> Qavámuʾl-Mulk III], was instructed to inform these Baháʾís. A list of
> believers was prepared and included: this servant; my brother, Hájí Mírzá
> Buzurg; ʿAndalíb; Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim Sáʿat-Sáz [the watchmaker]; Mírzá
> Yúsuf Naqqásh [the painter]; Mírzá ʿAbduʾl-Husayn Naqqásh, known as
> Thábit [the steadfast]; Mírzá Jalál Zarqání; and Áqá ʿAlí-Akbar Khádim
[the attendant].

This list was brought by Mírzá Muhammad-Jaʿfar Khán to my father
> with the request, “In the course of our consultation, it was deemed
> advisable for these gentlemen to remain at home until the pandemonium
> and riots have alleviated.” The Afnán responded, “Please do as they have
> suggested.” Thereupon, Mírzá Muhammad-Jaʿfar Khán proceeded to the
> homes of the Baháʾís on the list and informed each of this decision by
> the governor and the Qavámuʾl-Mulk. Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim, Mírzá Yúsuf
> Naqqásh, and Mírzá ʿAbduʾl-Husayn Thábit each had a shop by the
> entrance to the Shrine of Siyyid Mír Ahmad Sháh-Chiráq and immedi-

> remained home. My brothers, Hájí Mírzá Buzurg and Hájí Mírzá Díyá’,
and I remained secluded at the Blessed House of the Báb.

The ﬁfth day of demonstrations was a Thursday [4 June 1903], and it
> was noised throughout the city that the celebrated ʿulamá had issued a

Intervention of the Imám-Jumʿih

> Finding this suggestion agreeable, the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih asked Hájí Shaykh
> Yahyá, the Imám-Jumʿih, to be brought to his oﬃce. The latter was a
> particularly virtuous and well-intending person, always supporting the
> believers and the Cause, and never perpetrating harm or disrespect. Upon
> his arrival, the governor and the Qavámuʾl-Mulk briefed him on their
> predicament and asked his assistance in alleviating the troubles and com-
> motion. The Imám-Jumʿih promised that on the following day, [Friday,]
> he would admonish the citizens, calm the situation, and ensure that by
> Saturday all the shops were opened and the tumult subsided. They also
> decided to send a sum of money to the inﬂuential ﬁgures291 in order to
persuade them to cooperate.292

Friday morning, the public criers of the Imám-Jumʿih proclaimed
> throughout the city that four hours before dusk all citizens of every rank
> were to gather at the Masjid Vakíl in order to hear his sermon. People
> thought that this was the awaited hour when the Imám intended to
> announce his fatwá [against the Baháʾís].293 This news quickly circled
> through the city.

Presumably, a reference to the ʿulamá.

Based on his father’s recollections, Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán notes, “The Imám-Jumʿih had
> suggested that the best course of action was for the governor to donate a sum of money
> to the ʿulamá. Being in agreement with this proposal, the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih invited some
> prominent Baháʾís in order to confer with them and acquaint them with the situation.
> Those attending the gathering contributed a sum that totaled nearly one thousand tumáns,
> the majority of which was contributed by the head of the telegraph oﬃce, Muhammad-
> Husayn Mírzá, the Muʾayyaduʾs-Saltanih. When the money was ready, depending on
> the rank and inﬂuence of each cleric involved in the uproar, the Imám-Jumʿih allocated
> a portion to each. He asked the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih to write a letter to each cleric stating,
> ‘Since a surplus is available from the tax account and now needs to be distributed to the
> poor and needy, I am leaving it in your charge to disburse it in any way that you deem
> appropriate.’ The Imám-Jumʿih further emphasized that the governor should ensure that
> his attendants collected a receipt upon the delivery of the sum” (private communication,
August 1997).

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh added parenthetically, “The Imám-Jumʿih was peerless in elo-
> quence, and all the inhabitants, young and old, male or female alike, would listen to him
> attentively and with due consideration.”

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 166                                                                                   7/10/2008 3:45:30 PM

By the appointed hour, the entire courtyard, the cloisters, the roofs,
> and even the minarets of the mosque were thronged with onlookers,
> and the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk and other oﬃcials were in
> attendance as well. The Imám-Jumʿih, being more than eighty years of
> age and rather frail, arrived carried on the shoulders of his servant. On
> beholding him, in unison the crowd raised its voice in greeting. People
> were giving the glad tidings to each other that the Imám was about to
> issue his ruling and conclude the aﬀair.294 He ascended the pulpit and
> delivered an eloquent homily. Thereafter, he began his sermon, ﬂavored
> with his customary sweet stories and humorous anecdotes that only he
> could deliver. Having completely won over the attention of his audience,
in his most gentle tone he addressed the city’s inhabitants:

> O ye people! You are all well aware that I stand eighty years of age and
> that I associate with all the residents of this town and know each and every
> person from every corner and class. You also recognize that you all are truly
> like my own brothers and children. I will not permit, and surely you will
> not consent either, that certain malefactors accuse you, or some of you, in
> various ways and issue slanders about you. Recall to mind that the Apostle
> of God, Muhammad ibn ʿAbduʾlláh, peace be upon Him, has admonished
> His sacred community in the Qurʾán, “Say not to anyone who oﬀers you
> a salutation: ‘Thou art none of a believer!’ ”295 Moreover, the Immaculate
> Imám [ʿAlí] has stated, “We are to consider the evident aspect of things.”296
> Therefore, according to the text of the Sacred Qurʾán and the Tradition of
> the Holy Imám, we are forbidden from pronouncing others as unbelievers
or labeling them non-Muslim.

Having established this, I now ask you to repeat after me, and I promise [p.460]

That is, the people were expecting that Imám’s ruling would unleash a Baháʾí genocide.

Imám ʿAlí, Nahjuʾl-Balághih, p. 265.

A.Q. Afnán (private communications, August 1996) has noted that his father used
> to add the following said by the Imám, “Tonight, on everyone’s behalf, I will perform
> the Hájjat prayer and beseech the Apostle of God to intercede on our behalf on the Day

> Imám emptied a handkerchief ﬁlled with sugarplums over the heads of the audience and

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 167                                                                                     7/10/2008 3:45:30 PM

It was two hours until sunset when people left the mosque and happily
proceeded to open all shops and begin their commerce.

A number of Baháʾís, who were not known as such, had been attending the
> sermon at the Masjid [Vakíl] and at once came to the Blessed House of the
> Báb to inform us that the Imám-Jumʿih had wisely alleviated the disturbance
and had calmed the storm. May God exalt his station in the Great Beyond.

The following day, Saturday, all the merchants and the shopkeepers
> resumed their business, and it seemed as if none of these events had ever
taken place in Shíráz.

That evening, the Imám-Jumʿih instructed one of his conﬁdants, a most
> virtuous man named Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn ʿArifuʾsh-Sharíʿih, to
> ask Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim [Sáʿat-Sáz] to go see him. When the latter came
> before the Imám, he was told, “Mírzá, it is best if you did not dwell in
> Shíráz for a few days.” He responded, “But I have no place to go.” The
> Imám-Jumʿih replied, “I will arrange all details and ensure that they see

> [village chief ] of Husayn-Ábád Bízyyán where the Imám owned orchards
> located two farsangs298 from the city. Further, he provided Mírzá [Abúʾl-
Qásim] with suﬃcient funds.

After a month, however, the henchmen discovered his whereabouts and
> said to the Imám, “Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim has taken refuge in your property
> in Husayn-Ábád.” Recognizing that these people were intent on mischief,
> [the Imám] sent a message for Áqá Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim to return to Shíráz,

> with utmost kindness and generosity. Further, he was told by the Imám,
> “You must remain at home for a while longer and not attend your store,
> as the rabble in the Sháh-Chiráq area where your shop is located are
> preparing for mischief. I have also asked Mírzá Yúsuf and Mírzá ʿAbduʾl-
> Husayn to remain at home as well.” Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim responded, “But
> your honor must realize that I need to earn a living to support my fam-

After this period elapsed, other Baháʾís made an eﬀort and rented one

expanded, and soon he was most prosperous.301

Áqá Mírzá Yúsuf Naqqásh and Áqá Mírzá ʿAbduʾl-Husayn Thábit,

A.Q. Afnán notes based on his father’s recollections: “Other Baháʾís who had shops
in area of Sháh-Chiráq were also recipients of the Imám-Jumʿih’s immense beneﬁcence.”

Six of Baháʾuʾlláh’s Tablets to him are included in INBMC 51:279–83, nos. 282–87.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN

RESTORATION OF THE HOUSE OF THE BÁB

The Second Restoration of the Blessed House in AH 1321 [1903]

[p.465:1] From the beginning of the month of Rabíʿuʾth-Thání [27 June 1903],

> every time the post arrived, it brought a Tablet [from ʿAbduʾl-Bahá regard-
> ing the restoration of the House of the Báb] in honor of the Afnán. In
> the ﬁrst Tablet, it was instructed that an estimate of the total cost of the
> repairs be prepared and sent [to the Holy Land]. Through the aid of the
> Miʿmár-Báshí [the construction taskmaster], the Afnán prepared a detailed
> estimate of the costs of construction and a drawing of the Sacred House,
> and sent it to ʿAbduʾl-Bahá. Upon its receipt, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá revealed several
> sanctiﬁed Tablets insisting on immediate commencement of the restoration
> work of the House. In response, the Afnán began to make the required
plans and to assemble the necessary provisions.

At the beginning of Jamádíyuʾl-Avval [26 July 1903], the post from
> the Holy Land brought an exalted Tablet for Áqá Mírzá Áqá Núriʾd-
> Dín, the Afnán, as the custodian of the House of God. Therein, special
> emphasis and utmost weight were placed on restoring the Blessed House
> to its exact original form [at the time of the Báb].302 That blessed Text is
> included below so that the divine friends would become aware of God’s
inscrutable wisdom in this regard:

> Shíráz. The illustrious Afnán of the sacred Lote-Tree, the honored Áqá Mírzá
Áqá, upon him rest the Glory of God, the Most Glorious.

He is God.

Áqá Miʿmár-Báshí.

As the Afnán had instructed, the named personages assembled in

> of Isfahán and the [Russian] Consulate building is still current among
> people, and it is likely that the reconstruction of the Blessed House would
> likewise precipitate turmoil in Shíráz.” Others articulated similar views
and supported the same sentiments.

The Prince Muʾayyaduʾs-Saltanih, however, commented, “In this

> asked him for his opinion, and the Afnán stated, “I submit to you that

The Start of Construction

The Passing of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Núriʾd-Dín

> His attendant—a man bent on malice and enmity—noised abroad among
> the people, “The chief of the Bábís, who lives in the Shamshírgarhá street,
> is ill, and my master, who is his physician, has said he will expire any

> injury. Gradually, the same whispers reached our neighbors, and they too
> started trouble and insults. We also heard reports from various directions
> that the shopkeepers in the nearby bazaar were saying, “At the time of
Áqá Mírzá Áqá’s death we must not remain passive.”

This servant therefore concluded that our foes were making plans to
> uproot us, and as such I informed both the Prince Muʾayyad [uʾs-Saltanih]
> and Áqá Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán.308 The latter assigned several of his esteemed
> men, who were also Baháʾís, to quietly come and spend the nights in the
> residence adjacent to the House of the Báb. Moreover, the Muʾayyaduʾs-
> Saltanih informed Habíbuʾlláh Khán Bíglar-Baykí, “Áqá Mírzá Áqá is ill
> and is likely to pass away soon. The rabble is scheming to cause mischief
> and diﬃculties. As the city’s Kalántar, you must certainly prevent these
lewd elements from achieving their wicked purpose.”

On hearing this, Habíbuʾlláh Khán sent word to me through Mírzá
> Muhammad-Jaʿfar Khán, “Whatever is your wish, I stand ready to
> assist. The local Kad-Khudá and chieftain have been told, when needed
> and you are ready, to aid in the beﬁtting transfer of the corpse to the
> cemetery.” Noting his cooperation and cordiality, this servant expressed
> gratitude and continued to manage aﬀairs. Several devoted and dutiful [p.480]
> believers were selected to help during this period. They were: Áqá Mírzá
> Muhammad-Jaʿfar Khán; Mírzá ʿAlí-Muhammad Khán; Mírzá Lutfuʾlláh
> Khán, the Khádim-Báshí; Mírzá ʿAlí-Ridá Khán; Mírzá Asaduʾlláh Khán

> [the baker]; Mírzá Shukruʾlláh Jahrumí; [and] Áqá Mírzá Yahyá Khán.

and ready for service.

Through our consultations it was determined that it would be best not

necessary provisions for a memorial service were sent there.

With humility, submissiveness, and while uttering the Holy Verses, on

The appointed friends gathered to assist with the burial arrangements.

> Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Jaʿfar Khán, who was assigned by Áqá Habíbuʾlláh
> Bíglar-Baykí, instructed several of the farrashes of the latter to guard the

> ritual ablutions and the performance of other rites in accordance with
> Baháʾí percepts.309 That night, his remains were interred by the entrance

> into the night, the burial ceremony was completed, and together with my
> brothers and all the friends we returned to the Blessed House and spent
the night in mourning.

In the morning, a number of divine friends joined us in the House so

Baháʾí rituals for preparation of the dead and burial are provided by Baháʾuʾlláh in
the Kitáb-i Aqdas.

restoration of the house of the báb              177

The believers began to clean the House when, in accordance to their
> everyday practice, all the laborers, carpenters, and other workers arrived
> and on hearing what had transpired, although they were not Baháʾís,
> most selﬂessly began to help to clean the House. Within two hours the
> entire Blessed House was cleared of all the construction materials and was
> completely furnished. In addition, tea, coﬀee, sherbet, and other refresh-
ments were ready for the visitors.

As was customary, the Muʿarrif-Báshí invited the Qurʾán reciters, who
> arrived and began chanting Sacred Verses. For three days, the believers
> and other friends from all strata of the community would visit and share
in the prayer vigils.

It was customary that on such occasions an important person would
> come on the third day and conclude the prayer gathering. As such, on [p.485]
> the ﬁnal day, in company of a number of ministers and farrashes, Áqá
> Mírzá Ibráhím Khán, the eldest son of the Áqá Habíbuʾlláh Khán, the
> Qavámuʾl-Mulk [IV], arrived and ceremoniously concluded the com-
> memorative prayer vigils. The fact that such dignitaries came for this
purpose left many of the nonbelievers wonder-struck.

This third day of the memorial meeting coincided with the 28 Shaʿbán
> [19 November 1903], which was the anniversary of the martyrdom of
> His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb], and the sound of mourning and
> lamentation was raised high from the Blessed House and the adjacent
homes.

Much wisdom was concealed and enshrined in the way that this
> memorial service unfolded, and it only gradually became apparent. For
> instance, previously the non-Baháʾís had all manner of thoughts about
> the reconstruction of the Blessed House and had allowed their imagina-
> tions to run wild in this regard. They had wondered what construction
> was taking place in such small dwelling and what purpose it was to serve.
> However, when they came [for the services], they saw that their previous
> notions were wrong and that their imaginations had led them astray, and
> realized that it was only a simple House. The other misconception was
> that they never thought we would be in a position to associate with the
> most prominent and inﬂuential citizens of the community, including
many among the wealthy and the merchants.

Through this incident, they grew cognizant of the majesty of the Cause
> and the great inﬂuence of the Blessed House, and their eyes and ears
> were ﬁlled with this. Therefore, much talk and plans for mischief were
> discarded, nor were unseemly remarks uttered in secret about the House
> or these servants, now spoken after these events. In fact, in contrast to

The period of the Afnán’s illness until his passing was about forty-

Completion of the Restoration

> Áqá Hájí Mírzá Buzurg, continued to send monthly, nay, weekly detailed

> revealed many Tablets during this period in honor of these ephemeral
servants.

From the beginning of construction to the end, it took almost two
> years and a few months, and throughout this period the work advanced
> methodically. The divine friends in Fárs and other parts of Iran donated
> towards the expenses of the restoration; a list of contributors was regularly
submitted to the presence of the Master; and receipts issued therefrom.

When all the work was completed, there was a shortfall of ﬁve hundred

Praised be God, and thanks be unto Him for what hath transpired.

The news of the illness of the mother of Áqá Mírzá Baháʾuʾd-Dín brought
> sadness and much sorrow, and I prayed for her forgiveness at His Threshold of

> It was given to a most deserving person in a condition of desperate need.
This turn of events further testiﬁes to the purity of her intentions.

> Praise and salutations be upon you.

It is important to record in these pages of history the text of ʿAbduʾl-

CHAPTER FIFTEEN

POLITICAL TURMOIL AND CONSTITUTIONAL REVOLT

> As the demise of Qájár rule drew near, each day witnessed a new dis- [p.501:1]
> turbance or commotion in the nation as a whole, and the occurrences
> of many incidents, especially in the province of Fárs. Every year brought
> a new cycle of upheaval, with each lasting some three to four months.
> The ﬁrst step in instigating troubles was to encourage the vulgar and the
> mob elements to compose the most unseemly verses against this party
> [i.e., Baháʾís] and to chant these in their street marches, giving vent to
> all manner of insults and slanders against this people. Rank upon rank
> of rogues, led ﬁrst by the youths and followed by the adults, all carrying
> pistols, riﬂes, swords, and clubs, would shut the bazaar and congregate
> in the mosques and shrines demanding the dismissal of the governor.
> They would advance the charge, “The governor is a Bábí, and we refuse
> a Bábí governor!” Through the most horriﬁc deeds, they would eﬀect the
> dismissal of the governor [and other authorities]. And since the central
> government had grown particularly weak and ineﬀectual, it was unable
> to rule and prevent the mob from such disturbances.

Community Inﬁltration by Dervish ʿAlí

> During this time, an insidious character by the name of Dervish ʿAlí
> became acquainted with some gullible Baháʾís and expressed a deep desire
> to learn about the Faith. In response, some of the friends began to teach
> him, and for a while he associated with the believers working in the
> bazaar. Through these contacts he learned many Baháʾí expressions and
> teachings, including the identity of the early believers, the martyrs, and
> the Letters of the Living of the ﬁrst Era, and knew the membership of
the entire Baháʾí community of Shíráz, young and old alike.

Once he had collected suﬃcient intelligence, [he showed his true
> colors and] quietly began to whisper critically about the Faith. Certain
> non-Baháʾís capitalized on the situation and, realizing that he was a useful
> instrument in their designs for turmoil, further encouraged him during
> periods of disturbance. This unprincipled man, however, worked both
> sides of the fence. That is, while he was aligned with the troublemakers,

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 183                                                                    7/10/2008 3:45:32 PM

> he continued his association with many Baháʾí shopkeepers of the bazaar
> who would secretly show him every consideration and pay him ransom in
> order for him not to divulge their identity publicly. This, as it turned out,
> only further incited him in his ways, and in fact he made it his business
[to blackmail the friends].

Throughout the year, summer and winter alike, carrying a club, he
> would walk the streets each day: the mornings among the shops, the
> middays at the mosque and shrines, and the afternoons in the streets
> and marketplaces. Thus he would grossly insult and vilify the Cause. He
> would start by calling out the names of the Holy Figures in the most
> indecorous language, and add to it insults and abuse on the Letters of
> the Living and the martyrs of the Cause—all in the most unseemly
> language and fashion. He would continue in this manner crying out
> the names of contemporary Baháʾís, and each name was accompanied
> by a most indecent characterization or designation. [For instance,] Áqá
> Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq Khabbáz [baker] was called “ ʿUmar”; Áqá ʿAlí-
> Akbar Khádim was “the angel of death”; the Afnán was “Chihl-Chiráq”
> [forty-light]; this servant was “Imám Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín”; Mírzá ʿAbduʾl-
> Husayn Thábit was “the Satan”; Mírzá Abúʾl-Hasan Darvázih-Bán [the
> gatekeeper] was “the devil”; and with such labels he would identify these
> personages. The canaille and the ragtag elements would circle round this
> mongrel, pay him money, and provoke, encourage, and goad him in
> this contemptible behavior. In such wise he would publicly identify the
friends.

For instance, he would come by the Sháh-Chiráq market and stand
[p.505] before the haberdasher shop of four exceptionally devoted, enkindled

> believers and abuse them by name, saying: “Upon the four candles of
> the Bábí society, Mírzá Abúʾl-Hasan, Mírzá Muhammad-Ridá, Mírzá ʿAlí,
> and Mírzá Muhammad, be a hundred thousand curses every instant!” The
> rabble that circled round this unscrupulous villain would then join in,
and they would in unison curse the believers.

He would then proceed a bit further and cry out, “Curses be upon the
> thrice ill-fated, Mashhadí Khusraw, Mashhadí Nazr, and Mashhadí Saﬁr
Kuláh-Mál Sarvistání in Gud-i ʿArabán!”

The cloister [of the Shrine] of Siyyid Mír Ahmad Sháh-Chiráq witnessed
> considerable public traﬃc, where scores of people would congregate and
> where many believers had their shops and bread-winning stores. Dervish
> ʿAlí would amass an even larger gathering there and stand for two hours
> naming all the Baháʾís one-by-one.

political turmoil and constitutional revolt                185

I especially recall that one day I was in the shop of the late Mírzá
> Abúʾl-Qásim Sáʿat-Sáz [watch-repairer], where believers would gather
> most days and meet one another. That dreadful man entered the cloister
> through the bazaar gate and ﬁrst named the blessed name and title of
> His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb]. Then he named the Blessed
> Perfection with His titles. And afterwards, Mullá Husayn Bushrúʾí, the
> Letters of the Living, the illustrious Quratuʾl-ʿAyn [Táhirih], the martyrs
> of the Cause, until at the end he came to the believers of the present
> age, mentioning each [Baháʾí] haberdasher, hat-maker, including Hájí
> Muhammad-Husayn Bazzáz who was a merchant at that time. At that
> time, Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim said to me, “Be attentive as your turn will be
> soon.” Dervish ʿAlí then named my late father, the Afnán, by saying, “A
> hundred thousand curses be upon the forty-lights of the Bábís’ grand-
> priest, Hájí Mírzá Áqá Afnán, and his four oﬀspring, Mírzá Jalál, Mírzá
> Buzurg, Mírzá Habíb, and Mírzá Díyá’, who live in the Shamshírgarhá
Street and serve the Kaʿbih of the Bábís!”

In reality, his introduction of the believers in this way served to let the
> seekers know that these men could provide information on the Faith and
could aid in investigating the truth.

For four years it was thus, and this scoundrel in collusion with other
> base and vulgar elements would constantly heap insults on the gentle
> friends. Several times, Habíbuʾlláh Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk [IV], who
> at that time discharged the oﬃces of Kalántar and Biglar-Baykí of Shíráz,
> banished that perpetrator of wrong [Dervish ʿAlí] as a means of main-
> taining the city’s order, preventing public commotion, and protecting the
> believers from the barrage of insults. Being exiled from the city, he would
> however continue unhindered in the surrounding towns and villages, and
> soon would reappear in Shíráz. He also had taught his ill-reputed twelve-
> year-old son to behave in exactly the same way as he himself did in all
the markets and streets.

At the appointed time though, the ocean of divine wrath billowed forth,
> and this man contracted heinous diseases, such as melancholy and black
> leprosy. With a thoroughly disﬁgured face and mouth, he lived home-
> less in the streets, and all would ﬂee on seeing his diseased person. Even
> among the foes and the nonbelievers, he became an example of divine
> chastisement. In the utmost misery and anguish he left this nether world
> and was condemned to eternal condemnation. “Take heed, O men of
> understanding.” It was never known what happened to his ill-mannered
> son after Dervish ʿAlí’s death.

The Second Governorship of the Shuʿáʿuʾs-Saltanih

As noted earlier, because of the perpetual turmoil and disturbances, none
[p.510] of the citizens, especially the Baháʾís, had a moment’s peace. At nights, the

> roar of guns and riﬂes, and in daytime, the fury of the riﬀraﬀ ’s protests and
> uproar of the ragtag and thugs continued. Most shops and marketplaces
> were closed in fear of the rabble’s attacks and plunder. The ʿulamá were
> growing weary of the situation and indeed even sensed personal threats.
> They repeatedly cabled [the authorities in] Tihrán and succeeded in win-
> ing the immediate dismissal of Mírzá Ahmad Khán, the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih.
> The latter left during the night, and aﬀairs were placed in the hands of
> Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk [III]. With this news, tran-
quility returned to the city, and all the shops opened for business.

A second telegram [from Tihrán] in AH 1322 [1904] announced the
> appointment of the Prince Malik Mansúr Mírzá, the Shuʿáʿuʾs-Saltanih,
> to the oﬃce of governor-general, and he installed Muhammad-Husayn
> Mírzá, the Muʾayyaduʾs-Saltanih,315 as his deputy-governor and in charge
> of the city. The Prince arrived after one or two months, and for a year
> thereafter the city was calm and orderly; and no one breathed any dis-
> content, all working harmoniously with one another and none uttering
an insult against the Cause.

However, Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk, still harbored
> deep resentments from the governor’s ﬁrst tenure, the support that the
> latter had received from the Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís, and the uproars that were
> triggered as result of the telegraph oﬃce incident. As such, he constantly
> sought an opportunity to instigate troubles leading to the governor’s demise
> and exit from the city. Secretly, he met with the ʿulamá and created favor-
> able conditions for the renewal of turmoil and agitation.

Public Disturbances

> The ﬁrst step was taken when Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím Mahallátí, one of the
> foremost ʿulamá, stated in his seminary classes, “From what I have heard,
> the home of [Mullá] Mayvar, the Jew, has a taller wall than the home of
> the Muslims. This is against our religious law and is strictly forbidden.

His wall must be torn down.” Since they had already assembled all the

This Qájár Prince was the powerful head of the telegraph oﬃce and a steadfast
Baháʾí.

> necessary provisions for a disturbance and altercation, upon this pro-
> nouncement, the rabble raised the cry of “Yá ʿAlí!” and “Haydar, haydar!”
> to the pinnacle of the heavens, and began to march in the streets and the
> bazaar. All the shops and the markets were shut. Led by wanton women
> and youngsters, the populace, thugs, and ruﬃans rushed to that Jewish
> home, and thoroughly destroyed it and plundered all its possessions. The
> governor tried to prevent further public disturbances, but it only fueled
> the fury. That very night, the opposition fortiﬁed all the strategic build-
ings and placed gunmen on the elevations.

When the governor learned that the people, provoked by the ʿulamá,
> had arisen to perpetrate mischief and were about to attack the Jewish
> quarter and murder and plunder the inhabitants of that district,316 he
> summoned Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán,317 the Amír-Panjih [Major General] of the
> Farydaní forces, and instructed him to protect the Jewish homes. Imme-
> diately, Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán, the Muʿazziamuʾl-Mulk, arrayed his soldiers,
> assigned them to various posts in that quarter, and placed armed guards
on the rooftops of the Jewish homes.

Led by the ʿulamá, the mob congregated next morning in the Masjid
> Naw and Sháh-Chiráq, which were joined together. In unison, they raised
> the chant, “The Prince is Bábí, and his administration is entirely Bábí!
> We refuse a Bábí governor!” And in like manner, they began the most
> indecorous and degrading chants against the Faith and everything associ-
> ated with this wronged party. The word Bábí and unseemly insults were
> the currency of the day. Climbing to the Masjid’s roof, they were crying
> a series of repulsive and abhorrent verses that actually made no sense
whatsoever, yet each verse contained an insult to “the Bábí Prince.”

Soon, the congregation—akhúnds, siyyids, dervishes, thugs, and rabble
> alike—fervently raised the chant of “Bábí, Bábí!” and decided to rush
> forth and ransack the Jewish quarter, completely destroying the homes
> belonging to the Baháʾís and to massacre every believer. The Masjid Naw
> was in close proximity to the Jewish district, and the Blessed House of [p.515]
> the Báb was situated between the two. In fact, all the rooftops from the
> Masjid to the Jewish quarter were contiguous, and in the process, one
> would need to use the roof of the Blessed House in order to gain access
> to the Jewish homes. This rendered the position of the Blessed House
> precariously dangerous.

The House of the Báb was also located in that quarter.

A staunch Baháʾí.

The commotion in the Masjid continued for three days, and on the
> third day, when the throng of the ʿulamá, merchants, shopkeepers, and
> the populace were assembled, the divines ordered the assault on the [Jew-
> ish] quarter and the murder of its inhabitants. The thugs and youngsters
> began to charge from the rooftops, and a large number took to the streets
and rushed in that direction.

Jaʿfar-Quli Khán, who was commissioned to protect and safeguard the
> Jewish neighborhood, had his troops positioned in the quarter. He and
> some of his men were resting and smoking water-pipes on the rooftop
> of the residence of Mullá Rabíʿ, one of the Jewish merchants. From this
> vantage-point, he readily saw the mob advancing on the quarter with
> great haste. He took out of his pocket a copy of the Qurʾán and handed
> it to his special attendant, Mírzá Husayn—one of the most devoted and
> enkindled Baháʾís—with the instruction, “With great urgency, reach these
> ignorant people and tell them on my behalf, ‘I am tasked to safeguard
> this quarter, and I have sworn on these Words of God that I shall carry
> out my charge and repulse your assault. Therefore, halt your attack and
do not cause diﬃculties for either of us.”

Mírzá Husayn quickly reached the Masjid and came before the dis-
> tinguished ʿulamá conveying the message of the Amír-Panjih only to
> see his warning completely ignored. Returning at once, Mírzá Husayn
> informed his commander of the determination of the ʿulamá to proceed
> with their aggression, and in turn, Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán, the Amír-Panjih,
> concluded that once the quarter came under an assault and pillage, then
> the Blessed House of the Báb would surely be destroyed as well. There-
> fore, as the throng of the ignorant mob left the Masjid over the rooftops,
> destined for the [Jewish] quarter, the Amír-Panjih ordered the trumpets
> sounded, summoned his men, distributed live ammunition to his soldiers,
> armed himself with a pistol, and stood ready for battle against the
mob.

Meanwhile, a number of the friends had joined me in the Blessed
> House, and these included: Mírzá Lutfuʾlláh, the Khádim-Báshí [the
> governor’s attendant]; Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq Khabbáz [the baker];
> Mírzá Shukruʾlláh Jahrúmí; Mírzá ʿAlí-Muhammad Khán; and my broth-
> ers, Hájí Mírzá Buzurg and Hájí Mírzá Díyá’. One can well imagine the
> condition that we were in and the uncertainty that governed. Resigned
> to the Will of God and yearning for His conﬁrmations, we were busy
> praying fervently and supplicating, and waiting to see what the Almighty
> had decreed for us.

By then, several of the malcontent and the rabble had reached the

> descend to the courtyard and enter the House when Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán,
> the Amír-Panjih, who was nearby, learned of their position and ordered

Based on his father’s recollections, A.Q. Afnán notes (private communication,
August 1997):

> The ʿulamá’s other excuse for uproar and revolt was the presence of Abúʾl-Hasan
> Mírzá, the Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís, who had lived in Shíráz with inﬂuence and respect for
> well nigh ﬁfteen years and who was involved in ecclesiastical matters and delivered
> ﬁery sermons. During this time, his Baháʾí identity had been discovered, and because
> of his close association with the Shuʿáʿuʾs-Saltanih and his direct involvement in
> governmental aﬀairs, they noised abroad, “The Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís has converted the
> Shuʿáʿuʾs-Saltanih and his men to the Bábí Faith.” This tumult was so potent that it
> forced the Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís to leave the city in the middle of the night for Isfahán,
> leaving his wife and family in care of Shaykh Muhammad-Taqí Zulqadr Fasáʾí who

with much diﬃculty procured a house for them in Isfahán and saw to their comfort.

Meanwhile, the Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís sent a telegram to the Prince Muʾayyaduʾs-Saltanih
> and asked him also to rent a dwelling for him. The Muʾayyaduʾs-Saltanih rented two

> Vazír, Áqá Muhammad Sarráf, and a few other Baháʾís prepared a tent and a pulpit
> for Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís to deliver sermons, as he was renowned for his eloquence and
deductive style. After a few months, however, he left in favor of residence in Tihrán.

During the entire course of the upheaval in Shíráz, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk plotted
ways to overthrow the Shuʿáʿuʾs-Saltanih.

Eventually, after three months, a telegram was received from Tihrán,
[p.520] dismissing Prince Shuʿáʿuʾs-Saltanih from oﬃce and summoning him to

Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk [III], establish order.

political turmoil and constitutional revolt              191

For instance, he ordered a band to play music by the old Maydán
> Túpkhánih, which currently is known as the Pahlaví Circle or Bágh Millí
> [the National Garden]. Several cafés and teahouses were established in
> that place, and the concourse of citizens were encouraged to frequent the
> area, partake of the festivities, and make merry. He himself would walk
> among them in civilian garb and observe their behavior and disposition.
> Whenever anyone oﬀended another or behaved iniquitously, that person
was summarily arrested and dealt with accordingly.

On one occasion, I was present in the Maydán when an akhúnd rep-
> resenting Mírzá Ibráhím Mahallátí came before the illustrious governor
> [the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih]. He stated, “Áqá Hujjatuʾl-Islám has asked me to
> convey, ‘Since a number of worshipers and I are engaged in oﬀering our
> obligatory prayers in the [nearby] Masjid Vakíl, the sound of music disturbs
> our concentration. It would be good if you could order the music stopped
> during the intervals when the worshipers are praying.’ ” Upon hearing this
> comment, the governor pulled the akhúnd forward and slapped him hard,
> saying, “To hell with Áqá for making this request! You go tell that akhúnd,
> ‘You keep busy with your duty, and do not interfere with the aﬀairs of the
> state and the authorities. You say your prayers, and we play our music!’ ”
> He added to this several of his choicest curses and sent those as a gift for
> the Áqá! He then ordered two more bands to join on the opposite sides
of the Maydán and to play music as loud as they could!

In short, for a year and a half, he ruled very eﬀectively and prevented
> the ill-intentioned mischief-makers from instigating trouble. However,
> since the Qájár’s reign was coming to an end and from other regions revo-
> lutionary sentiments and general discontent were spilling over to Shíráz,
> the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih realized that his eﬀorts would soon be neutralized and
> that agitators would prepare the means of upheaval. Therefore, he cabled
> his resignation from the governorship of Fárs and proceeded to Tihrán.

The Rule of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk, AH 1324

> That year passed amiably. During that period, Muhammad-Ridá Khán,
> the Qavámuʾl-Mulk [III], was in Tihrán, and the condition of there was
> unstable and tumultuous, as various groups had conﬂicting agendas and
> diﬀering objectives. Every year, a new governor would be appointed for
> Fárs, but because of the nation-wide turmoil and mayhem, he would
> be dismissed from oﬃce and in a most absurd manner quit the region. [p.525]

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 191                                                                    7/10/2008 3:45:34 PM

> Therefore, by then, no one was willing to accept Tihrán’s oﬀer of this post.
> However, Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk, did accede to this
overture and arrived back at Shíráz as the new governor-general.

Upon entry into Shíráz he moved quickly to consolidate his position
> and establish order. He appointed his eldest son, Habíbuʾlláh Khán, as his
> deputy, and his younger son, Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí Khán, the Nasruʾd-
> Dawlih, was put in charge of the armed forces. He further invited to
> the governor’s oﬃce the most prominent leaders of diverse groups and
> publicly bestowed the robe of honor upon them. In short, he managed
> to completely seize the reins of the aﬀairs of Fárs into his capable and
powerful hands.

This fact, however, did not sit well with the rivals of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk,
> that is, the Núrí family—the descendents of Hájí Amír and Mírzá Naʿím
> Núrí, who were mentioned earlier during the course of the Nayríz episodes
> and the events related to the illustrious Vahíd, and who constituted a
> family that was most keenly antagonistic toward this sacred Faith. A deep
> and entrenched animosity had always existed between the Núrí and the
> Qavám families, and they despised Qavámuʾl-Mulk’s absolute authority.
> Therefore, they began to agitate in opposition, provoked the populace, and
> won over the ʿulamá and beturbanned clerics to their designs. Gradually,
the pot of sedition came to a boil.

As was customary, the door of mischief was ﬁrst opened by heaping
> insults and abuses upon this much wronged community [i.e., Baháʾís],
> and the lead was taken by some of the ignorant yet seemingly learned
> ʿulamá who from before harbored belligerence towards the Qavámuʾl-
> Mulk. They would say, “All the aﬀairs and administration are handled
> by Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán [Dihqán], who is a Bábí and is
> among the chief lieutenants of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk. They desire unbridled
> authority, and with his collusion they plan on the conversion of Muslims
to the Bábí religion!”

Gradually, the standard of wickedness was hoisted, and the ﬂame of
> malice and rebellion was fueled beyond invectives and cursing, evolving
> into beatings and injuries. Whenever any of the Baháʾís were seen in the
> bazaar, without exception, they would be publicly subject to severe tor-
ment and harm.

This time the situation was worse than in previous upheavals, since in
> the past the principal target of assault was the governor, with the Qavám
> identiﬁed with the side of the populace and to some degree always able
> to exert inﬂuence to prevent the crazed mob from injuring the friends.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 192                                                                       7/10/2008 3:45:34 PM

> However, this time, it was the Qavám himself who was the governor of

> Therefore, the latter was powerless to protect [the Baháʾí Faith] against

the loss of much innocent blood was feared.

Anxious to avoid responsibility [in the anticipated pogrom], the head

The Constitutional Revolt

> Upon receiving this report and learning of the situation in Fárs, Ghulám-
> Husayn Khán Ghaﬀárí, who was one of the special ministers and among
> the governor’s ablest administrators, was appointed governor-general of
> Fárs. Since he was a wise politician, he telegraphed the appointment
> of the Mudabbiruʾs-Saltanih Núrí, who was the author of the mischief
> and troubles, as the deputy-governor, and himself left in haste for
Shíráz.

He arrived towards the end of AH 1324 [circa November 1906] and
> moved quickly to seize full control. Several experienced ministers accom-
> panied him, such as, the Mustawﬁ-Nizám, who eﬀectively dealt with all
> the details. They were able to ensure that none in the city committed a
> transgression against another, and that those uttering religious insults were [p.530]
summarily arrested and punished.

During this period, the incident of Tihrán occurred, and the wide-
> spread revolt and turmoil in the course of the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih’s rule, then
> governor of Tihrán, spilled over to the rest of the nation. As Muzaﬀariʾd-
> Dín Sháh was constantly ill and disappointed in absolutist monarchy, he
> therefore signed and promulgated Iran’s constitution in order to please
> his subjects. According to the new provisions, each town was to elect a

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 193                                                                     7/10/2008 3:45:34 PM

> representative to serve on the National Consultative Parliament, and this
fact was telegraphed to all the governors and provinces.320

As soon as this matter was noised about in Shíráz, once again turmoil
> commenced, and people divided into several factions. One group rose
> in support of the constitutional movement, while another in opposition.
> Many diverse [political] parties were formed, including the democrats, the
> freedom party, the conservatives, the constitutionalists, and the absolute
> monarchists. Each of these diverse parties developed activities, organized
> meetings, identiﬁed candidates, published position statements, authored
> manifestos and policies, made speciﬁc promises, and forged alliances over
> the text of the Qurʾán. Far more than at any time in the past, political
activism became the norm.

The absolute monarchists would say in one voice, “All of these uproars
> are incited by the Baháʾís; they are promoting the constitutional movement.
> Since they have suﬀered previously at the hand of the central govern-
> ment and have suﬀered under its coercion, they now exert themselves in
> wrecking the majesty of the Throne, and in the name of constitutional
> law emancipate themselves and cause trouble for the righteous Islamic
nation, nay see to its reduction and destruction.”

Conversely, the constitutionalists would say unanimously, “The Bábís
> and Baháʾís are antagonists toward parliamentary rule and supporters of
> absolute monarchy. They do not wish to see the nation ruled and organized
> by a uniﬁed code of law. In the present [revolutionary] chaos, it is they
> who gain most by promoting their wayward ideas through the illiterate
and ignorant masses.”

And yet the democrats would claim, “We champion the masses who
> must be liberated by any means possible from the injustice of the absolutist
> yoke and led to the haven of freedom and comfort.” The foremost enemy
> of the Baháʾís were the Democratic Party, as they constantly connived to
> cause trouble and diﬃculties for this much-wronged people.

Some time earlier, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá in a Tablet addressed to Núriʾd-Dín, had revealed

(INBMC vol. 52, p. 290):

> Praise be to God that His Majesty the King exerts the utmost patience, and with
> justice and equity wards oﬀ tyranny and favoritism. In a similar manner, the pillars
> of the monarchy and the ministers of the government will not tolerate the injustice
> of certain unwise elements and will exert themselves to bring forth the comfort and
> happiness of the people. Pray that His Majesty Muzaﬀar [Sháh] may prevail and
> his enemies be reduced and vanquished. For verily this Monarch is compassionate
> and merciful.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 194                                                                                  7/10/2008 3:45:34 PM

It was not long before Muzaﬀariʾd-Dín Sháh passed away and Muham-
> mad-ʿAlí Sháh came to the Throne [in January 1907]. Once more, the
> ﬁeld of mischief was thronged with ill-intentioned men who persuaded
> the Sháh against constitutional law, and he tried to rule as an absolute
> monarch. From various provinces, men who were not in favor of constitu-
> tional reform were summoned to Tihrán, and each was given new orders
> [to combat the opposition] and sent forth as governors or other oﬃcers.
> Included in this was Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk, who
> [having sided with the Sháh] was called to Tihrán, and after receiving
> full instructions returned to Shíráz where he formed a number of secret
> societies and swayed his conﬁdants against the constitution and in favor
> of absolutist rule and its beneﬁts. These activities, however, only served
to fuel the revolution.

From various regions, certain agents, known as Mujáhid,321 arrived.

> One group came from Tabríz, with diverse clothing; some others from
> Burújird; some from Rasht or Mázandarán; and from other places. The [p.535]
> town’s mischief-makers were particularly joyous over these devious develop-
> ments and created their own Mujáhid Society. Each of its members was
tasked with the murder of several [opposition ﬁgures].

The ʿulamá were also divided into two camps: one supporting the
> Qavámuʾl-Mulk [and his royalist sentiments], while the other was advo-
> cating constitutional reform and [parliamentary] law. The sole point of
> unity among all the diverse groups was their mutual animosity towards the
> divine friends [Baháʾís] and their abuse and insults of the believers. Every
> preacher who ascended the pulpit would devote his entire sermon, from the
> beginning to the end, to bitter denunciation, assault, and opprobrium of
> the Cause, and slanders and calumny against its wronged adherents. They
> would say, “The very authors of the constitutional movement are these
> people [Baháʾís]. This is because the foremost objective of this wayward
> group and the principal teaching of this insidious party are to strengthen
> the foundation of the constitutional and republican movement. We must
> exert our utmost to thoroughly eradicate these loathsome and ungodly
> people to ensure the tranquility of the nation and protect the radiance
> of Islam. Should anything other than this be attempted, the peace and
> freedom that we cherish will never be achieved.”

From the root word of Jihád [to exert], this term typically signiﬁes freedom ﬁghters.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 195                                                                                      7/10/2008 3:45:34 PM

Similarly, every cleric or preacher who was supportive of the constitu-
> tional reform would devote his entire sermon or homily to the destruction
> and extermination of the Baháʾís. They would say, “The main supporters
> of despotism are the Baháʾís. We must ﬁrst thoroughly uproot them so
> that the absolutists are frustrated and constitutional law is promulgated
throughout the land.”

And when the Mujáhidíns arrived, the absolutists claimed, “Mujáhidíns
> are entirely Bábís!” And likewise, the constitutionalists insisted, “Mujáhidíns
> are all Bábís!” In the midst of all this commotion, the believers were given
> not a moment’s rest or respite, and were the objects of attack of every party.
> As the famous adage states, “Harm always comes to the weak!” After the
> public’s ears were ﬁlled with such sentiments and the Qavámuʾl-Mulk’s
> objectives became universally known, the citizens of Shíráz were divided
> into three factions:

> • A large majority who were constitutionalists;
> • The absolutist supporters of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk;
> • And the moderates, meaning those who had no views.

> Once aﬀairs were arranged, various coalitions established, and groups
> organized, Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk, made a public
> announcement, summoning the whole of Shíráz and every strata of society,
> including the distinguished ʿulamá, the wealthy, the merchants, shop-
> keepers, farmers and others, to a meeting in Masjid Naw at three hours
> before dusk on Thursday. For this purpose the mosque’s courtyard was
> carpeted, tea and water-pipes were readied, and a number of ushers and
> servants enlisted. In the afternoon, rank upon rank of Shírázís gathered
> at the Masjid, and throngs ﬁlled the balconies and adjacent verandas, all
> waiting with great anticipation to see what would transpire and what end
> was to be achieved. After tea, water-pipes, and refreshments were served
> to the gentlemen, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk stood to deliver his speech. In their
> eagerness to hear his words, people pressed closer to hear him more clearly
and to learn his purpose.

Standing at the top of a pulpit made of ancient stone, the Qavámuʾl-
> Mulk commenced in a resonant voice by ﬁrst praising the majesty, the
> glory, and the sovereignty of Qájár Dynasty, and spoke especially of
> the abilities, courage, and the valor of Muhammad-ʿAlí Sháh. He then
> added:

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 196                                                                         7/10/2008 3:45:34 PM

> O ye, citizens of Fárs! Unlike other places, you must be devoted to the
> Sháh and aid the government, and must not be swayed by insidious and
> evil-minded individuals. The people that bestir themselves in opposition to
> the government have shown their true colors, and it is known what sort of
> people they are and what the nature of their objectives. You must not allow

> The scheme put forward at present and known as “constitutional monarchy”
> derives from a source and spring whose provenance is known to me alone,
> and unknown to you. And that source is none other than the newfangled
> party [i.e., the Baháʾís] who for many years have been anticipating this day.
> Currently, they wish to implement their true intent in its entirety. Since you [p.540]
> are not familiar with them, I will now prove this to you and demonstrate
> it adequately so that you might be fully assured of it.

> With this comment, he pulled out a copy of the Kitáb-i Aqdas from his
overcoat and with the resonant voice read the following verse:

> Let nothing grieve thee, O Land of Tá,322 for God hath chosen thee to be
> the source of the joy of all mankind. He shall, if it be His Will, bless thy

> Upon him rest forever the glory of God and the glory of all that dwell in
the kingdom of His revelation.

Rejoice with great joy, for God hath made thee ‘the Dayspring of His
> light’, inasmuch as within thee was born the Manifestation of His Glory.
> Be thou glad for this name that hath been conferred upon thee—a name
> through which the Day-Star of grace hath shed its splendor, through which
both earth and heaven have been illumined.

Ere long will the state of aﬀairs within thee be changed, and the reins of
> power fall into the hands of the people.”323
> O people! Do you really want to implement the constitutional reform

> His laws and percepts? Do you want to endure this regret? Do you not

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 197                                                                                 7/10/2008 3:45:35 PM

I have just come from Tihrán and know well what is transpiring in the cap-
> ital. Today, the Bábís and Baháʾís are the promoters of constitutional reform.
> All the disturbances in Tihrán during the reign of the late Muzaﬀariʾd-Dín
> Sháh were at the hand of these people! Since the late Muzaﬀariʾd-Dín Sháh
> was in ill-health and depressed and having no other recourse, he signed
> the constitution. However, His Majesty Muhammad-ʿAlí Sháh is against
> such a notion, as he is fully aware that such erroneous concept is based on
> Baháʾuʾlláh’s promise to His people! Of a certainty, you will aid and succor
> your loving Sovereign in this important matter.

> Having uttered such calumnies, he descended from the pulpit. Present
> at the gathering were several of the leading constitutionalists, such as
> Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir Istahbánátí, Siyyid Ahmad Dashtakí, Hájí ʿAlí
> Áqá Dhúʾr-Riyásatyn [twin chiefs], and some others. Unable to hold back
their fury, they protested vigorously and forcibly stated:

> With these nonsensical comments, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk intends to confuse
> people and uproot the constitution. However, it is now impossible to erase
> this sentiment [i.e., reform] from people’s mind. The tree of the constitu-
> tion, the choicest fruit of which is the law, will never be uprooted! The feast
> of absolutists and despotism will never again be spread, and the likes you
> can never enjoy its corrupt beneﬁts. No longer will you be masters, able
> to rule as feudal landlords where you can enslave the working masses and
> treat them as purchased possessions!

> Following such protests, a huge uproar and commotion ensued, and it was
> feared that many among the assemblage in the mosque would be killed.
> When the Qavám realized that the atmosphere was too explosive, he aban-
> doned his kinsmen and party supporters and quietly slipped away using a
> small door beneath the pulpit. When he reached the outside, he mounted
[a steed] and with great haste ﬂed to his [well-protected] residence.

Afterwards, Hájí Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir Istahbánátí, Hájí Siyyid
> Ahmad Dashtakí Muʿínuʾl-Islám, and Hájí ʿAlí Áqá Dhúʾr-Riyásatyn
> together with the Democratic Party and the Mujáhidín gathered in the
> home of the Dhúʾr-Riyásatyn and collectively agreed, “Muhammad-Ridá
> Khán’s speech against the Baháʾís was based on seditious plans, and we
> should not heed it in the least, but must ignore it completely. The Qavám’s
> purpose is to disrupt the constitutional process and has nothing to do with
> the teaching of the Bábís and Baháʾís. He wishes to once again subjugate
the people under his own vain imaginings and schemes.”

To this, Hájí ʿAlí Áqá added, “I know well that Baháʾís would never
> interfere in governmental aﬀairs or political discussions, much less would
> they agitate to sway the nation, be it toward constitutional reform or

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 198                                                                               7/10/2008 3:45:35 PM

> toward maintaining absolutism. The purpose of the Qavám in his talk
> at the Masjid was to discredit the reformists and to turn people against
> the constitutionalists by associating the constitutional movement with
the Bábís and Baháʾís”

Hájí Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir noted, “And what harm is there even
> if it were so? For us constitutionalists, the best thing would be for the [p.545]
> entire country, from whatever rank or creed, to support such parliamen-
> tary reforms. If they [i.e., Baháʾís] are patriotic and nationalistic, then
> it behooves them to support the constitutionalist party. And if they are
> against such reforms, then it is of cardinal importance to thoroughly
eradicate them from this land.”

And ﬁnally, Hájí Muʿínuʾl-Islám commented, “It is imperative for all

Multiple Assassinations

> On Saturday, 1 Safar AH 1326 [5 March 1908],324 from the early morn-
> ing hours until half an hour before lunch, Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the
> Qavámuʾl-Mulk, met with a number of his men in a large orchard adjacent

Bámdád, Sharh Hál Rijál Iran, vol. 3, p. 401, places this event a year earlier on
February 1907 when Qavám was 57 years of age.

> to his private residence. He encouraged them to act against the wishes
> and interests of the constitutionalists and made plans for factions [under
> his control] to undertake various demonstrations and protests. Having
> completed his discussions and plans, he returned to the inner apartment
> of his home for lunch and, while he was descending the stairs, a certain
> Mujáhid, known among people as Niʿmatuʾlláh Burújirdí, shot the Qavám
> three times in the heart with a small German pistol. Forthwith, Muham-
mad-Ridá Khán left this world of pain for the world above.

A huge uproar ensued in the Qavám’s courtyard and orchard, and the
> assassin was seized and on the spot fatally beaten by ﬁsts, kicks, sticks,
> and stones—and he too was relieved of the aﬄictions of this merciless
> world. Afterwards, they thoroughly searched his person to see what
> documentation could be found to identify the instigator of this crime,
but none could be found.

Failing in their search, they nevertheless raised the cry, “Niʿmatuʾlláh
> Burújirdí was a Bábí! The Qavám’s assassins were the Bábís! The murder
> was ordered by Mírzá Husayn Khán Kávarí, the Muʿtamiduʾd-Díván!”
> [They were placing this blame with] the Muʿtamiduʾd-Díván, because by
> virtue of his exceptional courage, valor, and audacity, it was well known
> among the populace that he was a Baháʾí, and no one doubted his alle-
> giance to the Faith. Moreover, [it was learned that] Niʿmatuʾlláh Burújirdí
> had stayed at his [the Muʿtamiduʾd-Dívánʾs] home, and therefore they
> were convinced that all evidence pointed to him regarding the Qavám’s
assassination.

In short, the remains of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk were washed, coﬃned, and
> laid out. His personal Husayniyyih was canopied, where a large mourning
> gathering and prayer vigil was organized with throngs of people from every
> class, such as distinguished ʿulamá, merchants, shopkeepers, and other
diverse groups came to share in the mourning from morn until eve.

On the third and the ﬁnal day of the bereavements, approaching noon-
> time, all the ʿulamá, businessmen, and prominent citizens of Shíráz had
> gathered for the occasion, and Habíbuʾlláh Khán and Mírzá Muhammad-
> ʿAlí Khán, the Nasruʾd-Dawlih, [the Qavám’s two sons] were sitting next
[p.550] to each other greeting the mourners. At midday the gathering concluded

> and the two gentlemen rose to thank the mourners and bid them farewell.
> Among the participants were members of the Democratic Party as well
> as [the leading constitutionalists] Áqá Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir Istah-
> bánátí and Hájí Siyyid Ahmad Dashtakí, known as the Muʿínuʾl-Islám.
> Of a sudden, the sound of a gunshot was heard, and Habíbuʾlláh Khán

> they have assassinated our master!” And with that, they quickly whisked
him away over their shoulders to his home.

In the ensuing pandemonium, frightened people were fleeing in
> every direction and included among them were the aforementioned Áqá
> Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir and Hájí Siyyid Ahmad, the Muʿínuʾl-Islám,
> who quickly exited the Husayniyyih and proceeded in haste toward
> their residence. However, they were followed by the Qavámuʾl-Mulk’s
> supporters, who bruited about that Áqá [i.e., Habíbuʾlláh Khán] was
> shot. After a short distance, one of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk’s men shot Áqá
> Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir in the back. He fell to the ground injured and
> screaming when a certain Sabbágh [painter] saw him and lifted him over
> his shoulders, and tried to carry him home, but both he and the Shaykh
were shot dead on the spot from behind.

Subsequent to the Shaykh’s assassination, Hájí Siyyid Ahmad, the
> Muʿínuʾl-Islám, was chased with the greatest haste, seized, and brought
> back to the Husayniyyih where he was brutally murdered. His remains
> were hung from the entrance, and the cry was raised, “We have exacted
> a revenge for our master’s death and killed his murderers! Now the rest
> of the wayward and inﬁdel Bábís can see what we intend!” With that,
> they burnt the corpse with straw and kerosene, and dragged it for some
> time through the streets and the bazaar, eventually throwing it into a well,
known as the Qalʿih-Bandar, on the Saʿdiyyih Mountain.

It should be easy to imagine the sort of tumult that overtook the city
> at that time and how wicked people took advantage of all these pretexts
> to cause mischief. All thoughts and discussions were solely on the issue
> of the Bábís and Baháʾís. It was an obstreperous and turbulent period.
> Anyone who committed a villainous act would blame it on this Faith and
> its adherents. Everyone admittedly maintained that both the murder of
> the Qavám and the injury of [his son] Habíbuʾlláh Khán were the doing
> of the Bábís! They even widely spread rumors in the city that it was solely
> the Bábís who killed Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir and in a heinous manner
> burnt [Hájí Siyyid Ahmad] Muʿínuʾl-Islám! In unanimity they would cry
> out, “The Bábís committed all these deeds and atrocities!” Thus, each day
brought a new wave of persecution.

By then the situation between the two contending factions of the
> constitutionalists and the royalists had reached its peak and deteriorated
> into open murder and battle. Animosity had reached its zenith, and the
> two sides constantly imprecated each other. The governor reported the
> matter to Tihrán at length and asked the court for instructions on how
> to deal with the situation. The Royal Court replied that Muhammad-Ridá

> Khán’s [the Qavámuʾl-Mulk] sons were to be sent to Europe. Therefore,
> both Habíbuʾlláh Khán and Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí Khán, the Nasruʾd-
> Dawlih, were sent by the governor from Shíráz to Búshihr and from
thence to Europe.

With their departure from Shíráz, Fárs became somewhat tranquil,

> the multitude favored parliamentary reforms. Nevertheless, the insidious
> elements continued to ensure that the Faith remained current in people’s
> mind and that it was blamed for every wicked incident.

The Itihád Islám Society

> During this time, the foes and enemies [of the Baháʾí Faith] organized a
> society known as the Itihád Islám [the Islamic unity] with the sole objec-
> tive of opposing, countering, battling, and eradicating this much-wronged
> Faith.325 During the months of Muharram, Safar, and Ramadán, from every
> mosque and pulpit, they would launch bitter denunciations and engage in
[p.555] slander and insults [against the Baháʾí Cause]. They taught their lads to

> confront the believers in the streets, by their shops and stores, to loudly
> curse and scorn them, and to pursue their victims with rocks and stones.
> The Baháʾí children were particular targets of these vicious assaults and
> were repeatedly attacked every time they came outside. Several despicable
> and bitter foes penned polemics in verse, put on the garb of dervishes and
> constantly frequented the streets, the bazaars, the mosques, and all the
> public places, resonantly chanting these poems—and in between verses
> insulting and vilifying the Cause—and after having defamed the Sacred
> Figures, they would heap contempt upon each of the renowned believers,
> who were named individually. Hearing such profane mocking and being
> the subject of relentless attacks would cause the believers to shed bitter
> tears and would break their hearts. We knew not what we could do to
lessen this fury.

It was during this time that many Tablets were revealed by ʿAbduʾl-Bahá
> in honor of various friends, and in these He strictly forbade the believers
> from participating in political aﬀairs, disallowed involvement in political
> parties, and proscribed membership in any of the factions. He admon-

The genesis of pan-Islamism and of this society are rooted in the eﬀorts of Siyyid
Jamáluʾd-Dín Afghání.

> activities the odor of dissension and disunity could be perceived. He even
> instructed the friends neither to attend rallies and demonstrations that
> could be construed as political in nature, nor to accept membership in
> any society, that they might remain safe and protected. In light of these
> instructions from our beloved Master, none of the believers attended any
> political gatherings or became entangled with any party. When any of
> our coreligionists was invited to attend a [political] gathering or join a
> party or in some way join with a society, he would oﬀer an excuse and
> not participate—this held true even on occasions where such participation
> was demanded. Believers’ avoidance of such activities and their lack of
> support for various cabals, of necessity, served to deepen people’s enmity
> and suspicion toward us.

Meeting with a Leading Constitutionalist

> In those days, the present writer had a particular matter to discuss with
> Hájí ʿAlí Áqá Dhúʾr-Riyásatyn and as such went to see him.326 Typically
> when we met, he would inquire about various Baháʾí subjects and tidings,
> and would especially inquire after ʿAbduʾl-Bahá, as he was very attached
to the Faith.

However, that day, upon seeing me, he inquired, “Why do you isolate
> yourself, avoid membership in political parties, and disassociate yourself
> therefrom? Is it not the case that Baháʾís also cherish establishment of
> constitutional laws? Is it not true that Baháʾuʾlláh in the Kitáb-i Aqdas and
> the Tablet of the World 327 has clearly and emphatically enjoined upon Iran
> the acquisition of a constitutional framework? Therefore, it seems evident
> that you [Baháʾís] must be more supportive of this eﬀort than others and
> exert your utmost to promote this critical undertaking. Certainly, you will
> not be well served by your avoidance of these parties and absence from the
> democratically organized gatherings. You must be present and succor such
> eﬀorts, and encourage and persuade all the Baháʾís to attend as well.”

Hájí ʿAlí Áqá was the chief of the Niʿmatuʾlláhí mystical order of Shíráz, and Mírzá
> Habíbuʾlláh has added the following parenthetical comments about him: “The Hájí ʿAli
> Áqá was a most righteous and good-natured man who had a considerable knowledge of
> this Cause. He would attend the private meetings of the friends and was well acquainted
> with the divine verses. Indeed, he even owned many [Baháʾí] books, such as Ishráqát,
Mufávidát [Some Answered Questions], the Kitáb-i Aqdas, and the [Kitáb-i] Fará ʾid.”

Baháʾuʾlláh, Tablets of Bahá ʾuʾlláh, pp. 83–97.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 203                                                                                   7/10/2008 3:45:35 PM

Noting that he was adamant in his view, this servant replied with wis-
> dom, “Clearly, Your Excellency is correct in everything you have stated. We,
> too, deeply desire constitutional reform and have no objections whatsoever
> to it. After all, as your own good self has mentioned, it is one of the divine
> promises that Iran will be adorned with the rule of law. However, as we
> are much too renowned, were we to participate in your political rallies, it
> would provide the absolutists with an excuse to discourage people from
> the constitutional reform and would make this fundamental document
> a plaything of the ignorant. That is, with our participation, you will
> not succeed. Wisdom is imperative under all conditions. You know full
[p.560] well that the Party of God [i.e., Baháʾís] not only does not oppose your
proposed reforms, but also is most supportive of them.”

On hearing this reasoning, he stated, “Of course you are right, and
> I agree too. But do your best to nurse people into adoption of the
> constitution.”

Formation of the First Local Spiritual Assembly of Shíráz

> In the midst of all the turmoil and worries, and at the height of the
> [constitutional] revolt, emphatic instructions were issued from the Holy
> Land for the formation of the Local Spiritual Assembly [of Shíráz]—that
> is, nine believers who received the highest number of votes were to con-
> gregate once a week to consult on all spiritual matters and on ways of
> ensuring the community’s continual, strict avoidance of political aﬀairs
and membership in various parties.

Therefore, on Friday, 5 Jamádíyuʾl-Avval AH 1325 [5 June 1908], the
> entire Baháʾí community of every creed came together in the home of
> Hájí Mírzá ʿAlí, known as Taryakí. The following nine believers received
> the highest votes: Mírzá Áqá Khán Bashíru’s-Sultán; Áqá Mírzá Muham-
> mad-Báqir Khán; Áqá Siyyid Muhammad-Husayn Afnán; Áqá Mírzá Áqá
> Afnán; Hájí Mírzá Buzurg Afnán; Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí-Muhammad Khán, the
> Muvaqarruʾd-Dawlih; Mírzá ʿAlí Ashraf ʿAndalíb; Hájí Mírzá Husayn-ʿAlí
ʿUmúmmí; and Hájí Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh Afnán.

The Assembly resolved to meet on Fridays at three o’clock in the
> afternoon at the [Báb’s] martyred uncle’s house, which ʿAbduʾl-Bahá
> had designated as a Mashriquʾl-Adhkár. In accordance with the Master’s
> instruction, the late Muvaqarruʾd-Dawlih had purchased two-thirds of
> this house, which had belonged to non-Baháʾís, and had donated it to
> the Faith. The remaining third belonged to three groups of the Afnán

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 204                                                                     7/10/2008 3:45:36 PM

> family: the children of Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán; the descendants
> of Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Hasan, the Afnán Kabír; and Zahrá Bagum. They,
> too, had ceded their shares to the Faith, and therefore in its entirety the
house belonged to the Cause.

In short, the Assembly meetings were held in this sacred location. With
> the utmost care, the Assembly was vigilant that none among the believers
> would associate in any way with any of the political parties and that the
> friends would avoid entanglement in such trappings.

The Murder of the Muʿtamiduʾd-Díván

> In that year, Sultán Masʿúd Mírzá, the Zillu’s-Sultán, was appointed gov-
> ernor-general of Fárs. Upon arrival, since the Qavámuʾl-Mulk’s sons were
> no longer in Shíráz, he gave Mírzá Husayn Khán, the Muʿtamiduʾd-Díván,
> the rights over the ʿArab and Khamísh tribes which had been part of the
Qavám’s estate. And the story of that incident is as follows.

At the beginning of the absolutists’ movement, the Muʿtamiduʾd-Díván
> was among the inner circle of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk’s most trusted men.
> Since Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk, explicitly trusted these
> two men, he would not attempt any undertakings without consultation and
> without the concurrence of Mírzá Husayn Khán and Áqá Mírzá Muham-
> mad-Báqir Khán. However, during the ﬁrst tenure of the governorship
> of Mírzá Ahmad Khán, the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih, a grave misunderstanding
> occurred between the Muʿtamiduʾd-Díván and the Qavámuʾl-Mulk that
> eventually escalated into open belligerency.328 The former completely
> withdrew from the aﬀairs of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk and threw his lot with
the Qavám’s enemies, aiding their designs.

ʿAbduʾl-Bahá was informed of this situation and in several sacred Tab-
> lets addressed to Muhammad-Husayn Mírzá, the Muʾayyadu’s-Saltanih,
> emphatically stated, “Mírzá Husayn Khán and Muhammad-Ridá Khán
> must be united with one another. Setting aside their diﬀerences and
> enmities, they must associate with each other in oneness and harmony.
> However, should they do otherwise, a grievous end awaits them both.”
> The Master’s admonishment was shared with both, but to no avail. Later,
> during the constitutional revolt, [as foretold by ʿAbduʾl-Bahá] the Qavám
> perished.

As a prelude to this division, the Qavám subjected Mírzá Husayn Khán to the
bastinado, an act which he greatly resented.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 205                                                                         7/10/2008 3:45:36 PM

[p.565]       As the Muʿtamiduʾd-Díván was fully informed of the extent of the

> Qavámuʾl-Mulk’s estate, he organized a large contingent of armed force
> and together with artillery and many soldiers proceeded in the direction
> of the ʿArab tribe in hope of fully consolidating the divergent elements
> of the estate. Informed of this undertaking, the Qavám’s family, however,
planned to murder Mírzá Husayn Khán.

With grandeur and much ceremony, in Rabíʿuʾl-Avval AH 1325 [April
> 1907]329 the camp moved from Shíráz and at a distance of ﬁfteen farsang,
> in the vicinity of Saydún, a certain ʿAskar Khán ʿArab, one of the ʿArab
> Kalántars, shot Mírzá Husayn Khán from behind. Seeing the latter fall
> from his horse, his brother, ʿAbbás Khán, quickly reached him, but he
too was shot dead.

A great pandemonium ensued, and the camp fell in complete disar-
> ray. In no time, the ʿArab tribesmen seized the supply of guns, artilleries,
> tents, and provisions. When this news reached Shíráz, a blanket of fear
> enshrouded the city, as everyone was deeply frightened of the prospect
> of heavily armed ʿArab tribes attacking the city and leaving none stand-
> ing. In this fear, all were united—whether reformist, royalist, democrat,
> moderates, or Mujáhid—all felt the same way. No longer was anyone
> speaking of the Bábís or Baháʾís. Everyone was apprehensive as to what
fate awaited them.

It was during this time that Muhammad-ʿAlí Sháh [disrupted the
> reforms and] discharged his cannons on the Parliament Building, seizing
> and executing several of the opposition. However, uniting their forces,
> Sipahdár from the North and Sardár Asʿad Bakhtíyár from the South
> attacked Tihrán, took the command of aﬀairs into their own hands, and
> surrounded the royal palace. Muhammad-ʿAlí Sháh ﬂed to the Russian
> Consulate and took refuge there. The Parliament dethroned the latter,
> and since Ahmad Mírzá had not reached the age of maturity, he was
> named the Throne’s vice-regent.330 In haste, Muhammad-ʿAli Mírzá left
the capital.

All the ministers and governors appointed during the reign of Muham-
> mad-ʿAli Mírzá were summoned to Tihrán, including Zillu’s-Sultán who
> was dismissed from his post in Fárs.

Given that the Zilluʾs-Sultán became the governor of Fárs during AH 1326, “AH
1325” seems to be a copyist error, and the correct date should be AH 1326.

Muhammad-ʿAlí Sháh’s abdication occurred on 16 July 1909.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 206                                                                             7/10/2008 3:45:36 PM

The Governorship of Ásifuʾd-Dawlih

> Ghulám-Ridá Khán, the Ásifuʾd-Dawlih Sháhsún, was appointed to the
> oﬃce of governor-general of Fárs and with a large contingent [of armed
> forces] arrived in Shíráz on Jamádíyʾth-Thání AH 1326 [July 1908]. He
> was a Turk, an ineﬀective administrator, and incapable of rule in Fárs.
> During his tenure, the aﬀairs of Fárs were in total chaos, and anyone could
> commit any act he wished. The rabble and the enemies took advantage
> of the situation and were committing all manners of atrocities against
> the believers—far worse than before. With the utmost cruelty, the friends
suﬀered great diﬃculties.331

Not long thereafter, after a sojourn in Europe, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk’s
> sons returned in accord with the wishes of the government and came to
Fárs.

Day-by-day, the believers grew in their love and rapture in the Cause.

> The greater the intensity of persecution and tyranny against them, the
> greater their unity and fellowship. Despite all the obstacles, day and night
> they were immersed in serving the Faith, teaching its healing Message,
> and awakening souls. During this time, Áqá Mírzá Tarázuʾlláh, son of the
> illustrious Samandar, and Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí-Akbar Rafsinjání arrived in Shíráz
> and commenced teaching in that city and its environs, such as Ábádih,
> Nayríz, Sarvistán,332 Dariyán, Jahrum,333 and other places, and succeeded
> in enrolling a large number under the banner of God’s divine canopy.

As an example of civil disorder in this period, the following comment by Abúʾl-Qásim
> Afnán was shared for inclusion as a footnote (private communication, December 1997):
> “During the Ásifuʾd-Dawlih’s rule, Mírzá ʿAlí-Muhammad Khán, the Muvaqqariʾd-Daw-
> lih, occupied a senior position in the British Consulate, and his job often required him
> to visit the governor. One day on his return from such a visit, his carriage was attacked,
> his horse shot dead, and he stripped of all possessions. In this state, he returned to the
> governor’s residence, harshly stating, ‘The aﬀairs in the province have deteriorated to such
> a point that shots are ﬁred on a man of my standing, and he is assaulted in the front of
> the Governor’s Ark!’ The Ásifuʾd-Dawlih replied, ‘The attackers were your own gunmen
> instructed to kill Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán and in error attacked you instead.’ These
> kind of incidents and incompetence were communicated to Tihrán, and soon the Ásifuʾd-
> Dawlih was removed from the oﬃce, and Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán, the Sahámuʾd-Dawlih, was
appointed as the governor-general of Fárs.”

Sarvistán had changed its character from the earlier days when Baháʾís were perse-
> cuted. By then most of the town’s inﬂuential ﬁgures and headmen were Baháʾís. The Baháʾí
> community of this town lived in relative tranquility and was a refuge for Baháʾís of other
communities who occasionally had to escape the wrath of persecution.

At that time Jahrum had more than 500 Baháʾís and was administered by Siyyid
> Muhammad, son of Siyyid ʿAbduʾl-Husayn Lárí. Both father and son perpetrated great
> harm against the Baháʾí Faith at later dates.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

BAHÁʾÍ MARTYRDOM IN NAYRÍZ

[p.570:1] During this period [winter of 1909], the heart-wrenching, heart-rending

> event of Nayríz occurred, and the details of that incident, perpetrated by
Hájí Siyyid ʿAbduʾl-Husayn Lárí,334 are as follows:

With his seat of power situated in Lár—a place known particularly for
> its warm [and inhospitable] climate—Hájí Siyyid ʿAbduʾl-Husayn was a
> low-ranking, ordinary cleric. He had built a long and checkered record
> in deceiving people. Gradually, he expanded his circle of inﬂuence to
> include such regions as Bastak, Lár, Galih-Dár, Jahrum, Dáráb, and Sar-
> Kúh. The inhabitants of those territories had fallen under his spell to such
> extent that they would consider it imperative to obey his every wish, nay,
> would deem his commands more meritorious and obligatory than their
> religious duties. In such depth had his authority penetrated the hearts of
> the population that if he were to declare their wives forbidden unto them,
> the people would immediately obey and would maintain their separation.
> They had noised abroad many stories of miracles and prodigies about him
> and would say, “Áqá, spreads his prayer mat on the pool and oﬀers his
> prayers standing on the water! He ascends the fence and canters upon it
> like a mount!” Such rubbish had become the foundation of the ﬁrm belief
> of that region. They would even take his ablution water for medicinal
> purposes, and with colossal prices barter the same with one another. All
> this had enabled this man to greatly expand his inﬂuence.

Persecutions in Nayríz

> When the tumultuous news of Muhammad-ʿAlí Sháh’s abdication and
> the installation of General Asʿad [Bakhtiyárí as the Prime Minister] was
> received, this gave Siyyid ʿAbduʾl-Husayn new ideas. Arraying a large
> number of armed men around him, he began to cherish designs for an
> [independent] sovereignty and throne. He issued commands and orders,

> and sent these forth for execution; summoned all the rulers and chief-
> tains of the region, as far as Istahbánát and Nayríz, and incited them to
> submission and inﬂamed their greed; ordered a widespread jihád; seized
> and placed under his own rule all the government functions, such as the
> treasury, post oﬃce, and the police; printed stamps [under the title of
> “the nation of Islam”] and paper currency in his own name; he organized
> mercenary forces from local thugs; placed each district under the com-
mand of a savage rabble and ﬁxed a reign of terror.335

Among this latter group numbered Shaykh Zakariyyá [of Sar-Kúh],
> who was assigned the command of Sar-Kúh, Maʿádin, and the districts
> of Istahbánát and Nayríz. That barbarous tyrant, together with a force in
> excess of a thousand strong, all thoroughly bereft of humanity and civility,
> moved towards Nayríz. A distance of two days’ journey from town, he
wrote to the Shaykhuʾl-Islám [of Nayríz], stating essentially:

> His Excellency, the Ayatuʾlláh Áqá Hájí Siyyid ʿAbduʾl-Husayn has currently
> ascended the throne, and the constitutional monarch is none other besides
> him. All must show submissiveness before him by considering his every
> command their religious obligation. As in accord with the all-sovereign
> wishes of the illustrious Ayatuʾlláh, I have arrived in this region today, I
> hereby charge you that, congruent with the instructions contained in this
> letter, you chain and send before me all the absolutist monarchists so that
> I many send them under guard to the illustrious Ayatuʾlláh, the Sultánuʾl-
> Muslimín [the king of Muslims], that he may punish them in conformity
with Islamic jurisprudence.

Moreover, you are to purge Nayríz of all members of the wayward and
perverse Baháʾí community.

Should anything other than what is commanded in this letter occur,
> then stand forewarned that I will come forth to Nayríz and will show no
mercy to anyone.

Signed by me, Zakariyyá Ansárí
> And on the envelope he ﬁxed his seal, “Nasiruʾl-Islám” [the defender of [p.575]
> Islam].

Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán notes, “An example of Siyyid ʿAbduʾl-Husayn’s savagery was the
> beheading in his own home of seventy-two of the tribal chiefs and the nobility of Garash,
> one of the dependencies of Lár. He claimed these men were the promoters of the constitu-
> tion and the followers of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk [III]. When this news was communicated to
> Muhammad-ʿAlí Sháh, he sent a telegram to the Nasruʾd-Dawlih, who at that time was the
> military chief of Fárs, which read, ‘Beloved of the sovereign, Nasruʾd-Dawlih! Where art
> thou? Who is Siyyid ʿAbduʾl-Husayn? All hail to the king!’ Before an answer was received,
> the monarch was ousted from the throne” (private communication, August 1997).

Upon receipt of this letter in Nayríz, some opted to bend before his
> will, while others at ﬁrst remained neutral but eventually grew appre-
> hensive of grave consequences and resolved to defend themselves [against
> Shaykh Zakariyyá]. As a measure of protection, the inhabitants of Nayríz
> commissioned a number of gunmen to the Sayf-Ábád Fort and secured
> and established fortiﬁcations on all the elevated spots and prepared for
> defense. However, the residents of Sayf-Ábád were entirely in favor of
> the new regime, which allowed the Shaykh [Zakariyyá] and his rabble
> to beneﬁt immensely from the situation. [Noting this betrayal,] some of
> the Nayrízí gunmen quit their fortiﬁcation, while others threw in their
lot with the Shaykh and led him triumphantly to Nayríz.

At the head of a large contingent, the Shaykh arrived in Nayríz and
> opened his hands and gave vent to massive looting of all Muslims—even
> the home of the Shaykhuʾl-Islám. However, as the home of the Shaykhuʾl-
> Islám and the surrounding homes had established fortiﬁcations and
> turrets, he decided to select that quarter336 as his own headquarters and
fortress.

With much embellishment and great detail, [Shaykh Zakariyyá] wrote
> of his victory to Sar-Kúh and Istahbánát and told them of what had
> transpired in exaggerated language. Overtaken by greed, the residents of
> those towns decided to proceed to Nayríz, knowing well that booty and
> spoils of pillage awaited them. After such a beginning, he commenced the
> murder and plundering of Baháʾí residents and ignited the ﬁre of mischief
and fueled the ﬂames of hatred.

Meanwhile, Muhammad-Hasan Khán, the deputy-governor [of Nayríz],
> ﬂed the city. On hearing reports of the events, due to his innate incom-
> petence, Hájí Ásifuʾd-Dawlih [the governor-general of Fárs] failed to
intervene, thereby allowing the ﬂames of mischief to burn brightly.

On the Shaykh’s behalf, public criers proclaimed throughout Nayríz,
> “Anyone submitting a captive Baháʾí, will be rewarded with a riﬂe. Hence-
> forth, all Muslims are safe and secure. Our sole purpose is to slay all the
> Baháʾís and none other.” On hearing this announcement, the friends of
> the Merciful [i.e., Baháʾís], who had previously gathered in the Masjid
> Jamʿih and had fortiﬁed that stronghold, retreated and ﬂed.337 The vast

Masjid Jumʿih Kabírih was located in the old Chinár-Sukhtih quarter, where most

Baháʾí Martyrdoms

> The following day, [two of the believers,] Mullá Muhammad-ʿAlí and his
> son-in-law, Mullá Hasan, were working the farm ﬁelds of Bíd-Lang, and
> were found and seized by the agitators. Bound, they were taken to Shaykh
> Zakariyyá. “We have brought you Baháʾís!” they joyfully announced. That
> murderous tyrant and merciless tormenter immediately ordered their execu-
tion by ﬁring squad. Thus, those two wronged-ones were martyred.

This incident bolstered the people’s audacity, as they realized that in
> order to rescue themselves from the fury of [Shaykh] Zakariyyá and also
> win the blessings associated with the slaying of the Bábís—which they
> believed to be a meritorious deed—they needed to carry out his wish
[and round up the Baháʾís].

Next day, three more believers were taken to the Shaykh. However, he
> cunningly compelled them to turn over all their properties and possessions
to him, and then they were released.

Hungry, thirsty, and ﬁlled with anxiety, the wretched believers who
> had ﬂed from the city wandered over the mountains. After two days, the
> myrmidons and henchmen discovered their location and apprehended eight
> believers with the intention of taking them to the Shaykh. En route, the
> captives were subjected to all manner of mistreatment and brutality, to
> the point that by the time they arrived at the headquarters, no strength
> was left in them and blood poured from their ears and heads, and their
entire bodies were covered in injuries.

Upon arrival, one of them asked for water, but instead the ruthless
> Shaykh ordered his immediate martyrdom by gunﬁre. In short, each of [p.580]
the eight was slain in a diﬀerent manner.

Moreover, that day,339 ten more believers, each in a diﬀerent way,
> perished at the hand of the rabble. Ustád ʿAlí Sabbágh [the painter] was
> riddled with bullets in the Chinár-Sukhtih quarters, next to the Masjid

According to the narrative of Mullá Muhammad-Shafíʿ Nayrízí, during 1853, the
> Bábí community of Nayríz took to mountains where several hundred of them perished in
> the most gruesome manner through their struggles with the military forces sent against
them. For details see Rabbani, The Bábís of Nayríz: History and Documents.

The date of this event is Naw-Rúz 1909. On that very day, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá interred
the remains of the Báb on Mount Carmel, and the Baháʾís in Chicago resolved to raise

> [Jumʿih]. The remains of that wronged-one were burnt and the cinders
> thrown into a well. Mullá ʿAbduʾl-Majíd, a sixty-ﬁve-year-old believer
> who had recently become blind, was heartlessly pulled from his home and
> most severely beaten. They perpetrated upon that man what no pen dare
describe. At last, they repeatedly shot him and burned his remains.

In total, the number of martyred believers reached nineteen,340 and
> were I to describe the details of each, much like the ﬁrst Nayríz episode
> outlined earlier, it would become a lengthy epistle.341 It should suﬃce to
> note that this incident was in every way more severe, more brutal, and
more harrowing than the previous episodes.

For quite a while, the widowed women and orphaned children, having
> lost their husbands and fathers, and having witnessed their homes destroyed
> and all their possessions plundered, lived in such conditions that indeed
> will remain a grievous stain of disgrace for the world of humanity. The
> majority of them took refuge in the mosques or spent [the chilling nights]
> in the streets or in the ruins of what once were their homes, now reduced
> to naught but a pile of rubble. When any of them tried to take shelter in
> the homes of their non-Baháʾí [relatives], they were forcibly denied. Their
> sole consolation was that they had not been killed like their men—insults
> and hardships they could endure.

Refugees to Sarvistán

> For two days, innocent children and unprotected women lived with no
> food or provisions. Meanwhile, hundreds [of Baháʾís] ﬂed into the wil-
> derness, knowing well that should any of them be caught by the rabble,
> their lives would be in iniquitous peril. Among such desolate believers
> were seventy-two who retreated in the direction of Sarvistán. What these
> refugees endured is most heart-wrenching and on par with the martyrdom
> of the other captives among their co-religionists.

> the Mother Temple of the West—thus three sacred acts in the East, the Holy Land, and
the West were intertwined on a single day.

The author’s narrative suggests a total of 20 martyrs: two on an earlier day, and then
eight and ten martyrs on another occasion, for a total of 20 martyrs.

baháʾí martyrdom in nayríz                               213

Some of the escapees located one another in the vicinity of Istahbánát
> and together proceeded towards the Rúníz village,342 which belonged to
> Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán and whose inhabitants were Baháʾís. The village
> Dhábit [chief ], Mír Muhammad-Hasan Nayrízí, was appointed by the
Afnán and for several days saw to the comfort of the refugees.

Suddenly, word reached them from Qaytás Khán, one of the inﬂuential
> men of Fasá, “I am commissioned on behalf of Shaykh Zakariyyá to come
> to the village of Rúníz, seizing [fugitive] Baháʾís, to send them forthwith
> before the Shaykh. As such, should any such person be at the village,
> you must see to their immediate exit so that you and I may not suﬀer
> problems and diﬃculties.” Apprehensive of the potential consequences,
> Mír Muhammad-Hasan, who for years had worked for the Afnán and
> served as the village chief, informed the hunted believers, “Qaytás Khán
> is a ruthless man and most likely would cause harassment. I suggest you
> prepare for departure towards Sarvistán.” The Baháʾís [not wishing to
bring diﬃculty on their host,] consented.

Even though their feet were severely injured from having sprinted [for
> many days] in the mountains and the wilderness, they recognized they
> had no choice but to ﬂee yet again. As such, forced by circumstances, [p.585]
with bleeding feet, they took to the desert.

They decided not to use the main road, as it might be frequented by
> ʿArab tribes and their cattle, and might cause them further trials. Led by
> a guide, they left in the direction of Kharman-Kúh. Still in the morning
> hours, however, the guide lost his way, and, deeply perplexed and con-
> founded, they knew not in which direction to proceed. On their way,
> they passed through areas where snowfall had accumulated in excess of ten
> meters, and they had to make their way deep in ice and snow. Despite all
> the adversities that had befallen them, constant expressions of gratitude to
> the court of their Beloved streamed forth from their lips. In that wretched
> state, in utmost humility and entreaty, they would raise their voices in
prayer to the Threshold of their compassionate God.

By noontime, due to extreme fatigue, none among them could take
> another step. They had no food or provisions, except a small quantity of
> ﬂour. Using the brushwood in the wild, a ﬁre was made and some snow-
> ﬂakes melted over a piece of clothing, and with that, dough was prepared

The original word is qal ʿih, which technically means fort, but in local parlance
refers to village.

> which allowed them to make a few pieces of bread. Though there was so
very little, bread was eaten, and then they proceeded on their way yet again.

By dusk, the way [to Sarvistán] was found, and by darkness the village
> of ʿAlí-Ábád was reached. However, fearing the assailants, they decided
> to press on, and by mid-night they reached the forest in the vicinity of
> Sarvistán. [In the darkness,] they lost their way once more and failed
> to reach their destination that night. Fire was made, and they circled
> around it—some fell unconscious, while others remained awake due to
the piercing cold.

At break of dawn, they rose and recommenced their agonizing, tortuous
> march. The vast majority of their group were so bitterly tired, injured,
> and starved that they could hardly take steps. Most had to satisfy their
profound hunger with only leaves and wild bracken.

By noontime, their goal was within a half farsang of the village, and
> yet they were so extremely tired and famished that they could not travel
> this short distance. All fell to the ground unconscious, preferring death
> to such misery. Two among them, being younger and stronger than their
> peers, rose and, placing their trust in God, proceeded towards Sarvistán
where their Baháʾí brethren resided.

During those days, the teachers of the Cause of God, Áqá Mírzá
> ʿAlí-Akbar [Rafsinjání] and Áqá Mírzá Tarázuʾlláh [Samandarí] were in
> Sarvistán, and the friends were ﬁlled with joy and ecstasy. However, when
> an ʿArab messenger arrived from the [Rúníz] village belonging to the
> Afnán and informed them of what had transpired, their delight turned
> to bitter sorrow. Quickly they exerted themselves to gather all the neces-
> sary provisions so that upon the arrival of their wronged brethren, they
> might be welcomed beﬁttingly. It was then that the two young refugees
> arrived and informed them of the occurrences and the condition of the
remaining party.

Immediately, food and carriages were gathered and a large contingent
> of the friends taken to the spot where the persecuted believers had fallen
> unconscious. Seeing them in that state and at the door of death, the Sarv-
> istánís cried bitterly over the aﬄictions and hardships that these devoted
souls had endured. They were all fed and brought to Sarvistán.

I wish to note for the reader that from the dawn of the Faith until the
[p.590] present, the Baháʾís and the Muslims of Sarvistán have lived together like

brothers and in the utmost fraternity have associated with one another.343

The implication of this comment is that Shírází enemies perpetrated or instigated
the several earlier episodes of imprisonment of Sarvistánís or their martyrdom.

> No enmity or animosity, which has typically prevailed in other regions,

> new arrivals and dealt with them with the utmost consideration and hos-
> pitality. Seeing the unity, the generosity, and the brotherhood that existed
among the Baháʾís, ﬁlled these Muslim neighbors with admiration.

After the entrance of this group, gradually twelve more arrived in
> Sarvistán. They too had endured greatest hardship and misfortunes en
> route, and were severely beaten and injured by the ʿArabs of the desert.
> The believers in Sarvistán received them with open arms as well, and saw

Return of Order

> Having noted the extensive harassment, disarray, molestation, and abuse
> brought about by Siyyid ʿAbduʾl-Husayn and Shaykh Zakariyyá, eventually
> Hájí Ásifuʾd-Dawlih [the governor-general] ordered [Mírzá Muhammad-
> ʿAlí Khán,] the Nasruʾd-Dawlih, to establish order in the region and in
> the border towns. The latter organized a large contingent, armed with
> artillery, moved on Galih-Dár, Bastak, Lár, Dáráb, Istahbánát, Sar-Kúh,
and Nayríz.

Proceeding with all due speed, Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí Khán, the
> Nasruʾd-Dawlih, ﬁrst arrived at Sarvistán and was briefed by the Nayrízí
> Baháʾís of the atrocities that had recently occurred. On hearing their report
> and seeing their wretched condition, he was deeply moved and lamented
> over what had befallen them. With much benevolence, he assured them,
“God willing, I will remedy the situation.”

In the company of the refugees, he then directed his camp towards
Fasá344 and asked the believers, “Upon our arrival at Nayríz, do not

The Nasruʾd-Dawlih stayed in Fasá for a little while in order to reduce the Nasírí

> Wait until the tumult and uproar has subsided, at which time it will all

> great wisdom and tact dealt with the citizens. Soon the troubles were
diminished.

Having heard that Shíráz had sent armed forces against him, by the time
> the opposing camp had reached Dáráb, Shaykh Zakariyyá had retreated
> to Sar-Kúh. God willing, in due course, I intend to describe more fully
the events of Siyyid ʿAbduʾl-Husayn and Shaykh Zakariyyá.345

Each week, a detailed report of Nayríz incidents and the suﬀerings of
> the friends of God was both cabled and mailed to ʿAbduʾl-Baháʾs pres-
> ence, which resulted in about ﬁfty Tablets being revealed and sent from
> the Holy Land. In addition, from the Holy Land, He bestowed a sum for
> the relief of the Nayrízí believers. The Spiritual Assembly also wrote to
> various parts of Iran and informed the Spiritual Assemblies in every town

> tions began to ﬂow [for the Baháʾís of Nayríz], and the Spiritual Assembly
> would distribute these among the Baháʾí families and the remnants of the
martyrs in proportion to their losses.

Gradually, the believers commenced their earlier professions and,
> through God’s favors their businesses became even more prosperous than
> before, and the divine friends were more successful than at any time
> previously, which served as a lesson for non-Baháʾís, although they did

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

POLITICAL REFORMS AND UPHEAVALS OF 190910

Dismissal of the Ásifuʾd-Dawlih

> On hearing of the occurrences in Nayríz, the general disturbances in [p.595:3]
> Fárs, and the ineptness of the Ásifuʾd-Dawlih, the authorities in Tihrán
> decided to discharge Ásifuʾd-Dawlih from oﬃce and appoint a compe-
> tent, law-abiding person as the governor-general of Fárs. Therefore, they
> telegraphed the dismissal of Hájí Ásifuʾd-Dawlih, with the additional
> instruction for him to quickly depart for the capital, entrusting the aﬀairs
> of Fárs to Habíbuʾlláh Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk [who became the acting
> governor-general].

Baháʾís in the Administration of the Sahámuʾd-Dawlih

> After several months, Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán, the Sahámuʾd-Dawlih, was ap-
> pointed to the governorship of Fárs and on the 1 Shaʿbán AH 1327 [18
> August 1909], accompanied by only seven others, arrived at Shíráz. As he
> was an accomplished administrator, upon arrival he rolled up the remnant
> of the absolutists’ regime and allowed the constitutional monarchists to
> ﬂourish. He announced that whoever volunteered [as a civil servant],
> would be hired with suﬃcient salaries. Many people from diverse strata
> accepted, and among those registering were a number of believers, either
> known or unidentiﬁed [as Baháʾís]. Included in this group was the late
> Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq Khabbáz [the baker] who was particularly
> well known as a Baháʾí, and indeed his fame was on all tongues. Other
> believers were less known or were unidentiﬁed [as Baháʾís]. With no
exception, all were accepted for service.

Very quickly, in the [Governor’s] Ark, which was one of the build-
> ings from the era of the late Karím Khán Zand, various functions for
> a city-government were ﬁrmly established. One section of the building
> was set aside for the [civil] courts [and the judicial system]; another for
> the police; another for the municipality; and another for the military.
> The central building was designated for the provincial oﬃces. The work
> of the government began to unfold in an orderly fashion and in accord

> with the established laws, which everyone was obliged to follow. All peti-
> tions were reviewed [by the governor-general] and if deemed to be a legal
> issue, submitted to the judiciary for processing. The governor, however,
> closely scrutinized all operations, and if an agency was about to act with
> inequity and carry out an unjust decision, they were punished accord-
> ing to the percepts of the law. All levels of the administration were most
> cognizant of the need for careful expenditure of funds and had discarded
> the old practice of bribery and gifts. He also eﬀectively reorganized the
armed services.

The governor was particularly close to the two sons of the late Qavámuʾl-
> Mulk—Habíbuʾlláh Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk [IV],346 and Mírzá Muham-
> mad-ʿAlí Khán, the Nasruʾd-Dawlih—and showed them much attention
> and consideration. He entrusted the former with the police and security
> forces,347 while Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí, the Nasruʾd-Dawlih, was prized and
> placed in charge of the military forces, with the title of Amír-Tumání.348
> The governor personally supervised the payment of monthly salaries to
> military personnel and ensured that payment was delivered properly on
the ﬁrst of each month.

The justice of the governor became renowned throughout the province
> of Fárs. In accordance with both religious law as well as civil ordinances,

are respectively the chief of police, the district administrator and the security forces.

political reforms and upheavals of –                           219

Opposition to the Sahámuʾd-Dawlih

> Aﬀairs progressed splendidly for six months, and all segments of society
> enjoyed tranquility and comfort. This peace and quiet, however, provoked
> certain mischievous elements350 to precipitate diﬃculties. From the begin-
> ning of the month of Dhiʾl-Hijjih [December 1909], crowds of worshipers
began to march in the streets.351

On 1 Muharram AH 1328 [13 January 1910], taʿziyyih commemora-
> tions were launched, and troubles were afoot. The rabble began provoca-
> tion, and the wanton women and lewd youngsters joined in the incitement.
> They marched in the streets and the bazaar and in the name of mourning
> [for the Imám Husayn] would level insults and slanders. The esteemed
> divines organized many congregations in various homes and placed certain
> ignoramuses in charge of each, tasked with directly or through allusions
> criticizing the administration’s reforms. Their intent was to underscore
> their opposition by insinuating that the governor [and his administration]
> had acted against the religious precepts and that the newly established
> government oﬃces were incompatible with Islamic teachings and its sacred
> jurisprudence. They exerted themselves in demonstrating that indeed the
> real purpose of these civil improvements lay elsewhere and was inspired
by other designs.352

They further insisted that matters of law must be decided in the reli-
> gious courts by the illustrious divines, not by the existing judicial system.
> Moreover, the opposition maintained, “The oﬃcials of the administration
> are members of the wayward and perverse community [i.e., the Baháʾís],
> and the governor has appointed Bábís to all such ranks. Such a government
> is harmful to the province of Fárs and must immediately and completely
> be aborted. Further, why do we need modernized police? Security must
> be maintained as before through Kalántars and Bíglar-Baykís, and admin-
> istered by the Dárúghihs and the local Kad-Khudás!”

[Mírzá Habíbuʾlláhʾs narrative ends at this point.]

Presumably, a reference to the absolute monarchists.

Political demonstrations in Iran are typically disguised as religious events, par-
> ticularly associated with the martyrdom of Imám Husayn, which is commemorated in
Muharram.

The author’s intent seems to be that the clerical opposition was implying European
regimes had inspired the reforms.

GLIMPSES OF SHÍRÁZ: 19101951

Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán

> [In the course of the following essay, Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán extends his father’s
> history by providing a sketch of the events during the Pahlaví regime until
> Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh’s passing. With gratitude to him, a translation of this
> previously unpublished narrative appears below. Translator.]

The Governorship of the Sahámuʾd-Dawlih

> Subsequent to his triumphant return to Shíráz, the Nasruʾd-Dawlih joined
> hands with his brother, Habíbuʾlláh Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk IV, in order
> to create tumult resulting in the abdication of the governor-general, the
> Sahámuʾd-Dawlih, and forcing the latter to quit the city. For this purpose,
> the two Qavám brothers succeeded in winning over the ʿulamá to their
> purpose and incited the leading mujtahids to create the conditions for a
> popular uproar. The ʿulamá were more than happy to comply with this
> request and reckoned that they could hit two birds with one stone, namely,
> to evict [a liberal] governor from his post and to uproot the Baháʾís. As
> such, in no time they noised abroad that the Sahámuʾd-Dawlih was a
> member of the wayward sect [i.e., Baháʾí Faith] and that he received all
> his instructions from the leadership of that community. Once again, the
> old method of using Baháʾís as the scapegoat and the raison d’être for
> the commotion proved most beneﬁcial, and the name Bábí was made the
currency of the upheaval.

Led by youngsters and ruﬃans, the streets were ﬁlled with demonstra-
> tors who shouted obscenities against the governor and the Baháʾí Faith.
> They had decided in secret that the most opportune time to bring their
> revolt to fruition was the day of ʿAshurá and had prepared intensely for
> that event. Their chief strategy was for the leaders of diﬀerent districts
> and neighborhoods to direct their march against the residence of Baháʾís,
> with the crowning goal of destroying and plundering these homes. In this
> regard, they had particularly targeted the Blessed House of the Báb.

On the eve before this occurrence, Áqá Mírzá Áqá Hakím [known as
> Faríd] was in the upper chamber of the Blessed House of the Báb reciting
> [Baháʾuʾlláh’s] Visitation Tablet for the Prince of Martyrs [Imám Husayn]
> when persistent knocks were heard on the main entrance. Upon open-
> ing the door it was found that the visitor was Mírzá Mihdí Bávanátí—a
> staunch believer—who informed us that when he was passing through the
> city’s Saʿdí Gate he had come upon a procession of mourners. From the
> leader of this group he had learned that on the day of commemoration
> of Imám Husayn’s martyrdom [22 January 1910], in the course of their
> procession, the myrmidons of the Kázirún and Saʿdí districts, along with
> the rabble of Kúshk ʿAbbás-ʿAlí and Tal-Khidash, planned to attack and
demolish the House of the Báb.

As soon as my father, Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh, heard this news, he sent
> Áqá Mírzá Áqá [Faríd] to apprise the Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih<99> of the
> situation. In turn, the latter wrote a letter for the attention of Mírzá
> Muhammad-Báqir Khán Dihqán and sent it through the same messen-
> ger. Upon becoming acquainted with the details, that very night Dihqán
> wrote to the Qavámuʾl-Mulk [IV] and his brother, the Nasruʾd-Dawlih,
> informing them that rumors suggested that various religious leaders
> premeditated the destruction of the House of the Báb. In this letter, he
> asked the powerful Qavám brothers to prevent the occurrence of this
> opprobrious and contemptible deed. Dihqán’s attendant, a certain Yúsuf,
> carried this missive to the Qavámuʾl-Mulk’s residence, but he learned that
> the two brothers had gone to the orchards at ʿAﬁf-Ábád. As the situation
> was most treacherous, Yúsuf proceeded after them to their vacation spot
and delivered his charge.

Deeply perturbed by the turn of events, that very night the two Qavám
> brothers returned to Shíráz and immediately summoned the leaders of
> the aforementioned districts. In no uncertain terms, the chieftains were
> told, “Our sole intention was to force the departure of [the governor]
> the Sahámuʾd-Dawlih, and not a general assault on the homes of inno-
> cent people and the pillage of their properties!” They exacted from the
> assembled leaders a solemn assurance that none would commit atrocities
against the Baháʾí Faith.

At the hour of dawn the following day, the Nasruʾd-Dawlih, in the
> company of cavalry and foot soldiers, came to the district where Sháh-
> Chiráq, Masjid Naw, and the Jewish quarter were situated—the neigh-
> borhood where the House of the Báb was located. By a show of force,
> he wanted to make certain that law and order were maintained and
> that none dared to be presumptuous towards the Blessed House of the

> Báb. He spent the day in the district and took his lunch at the honored
> Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih’s home, which was situated in close proximity to the
Masjid Naw and the House of the Báb.

Soon, processions from the various townships and villages arrived in
> Shíráz, armed with shovels and pickaxes, and determined to do harm.
> However, to their astonishment, they found their designs against the Baháʾí
> Faith thoroughly frustrated. It was the eﬃciency and the wisdom of the
> Qavámuʾl-Mulk and the Nasruʾd-Dawlih, as well as the resolute act of
> Dihqán and the Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih that prevented riots and protected
the Blessed House of the Báb.

Not long after, the Sahámuʾd-Dawlih was dismissed from oﬃce, and
> Ridá-Qulí Khán, the Sálár-Muʿazam, who later came to be known as the
> Nizámu’s-Saltanih II, was appointed as the governor-general of Fárs.

The Governorship of the Sálár-Muʿazam, until AH 1330 [1912]

> Before coming to Shíráz, [Ridá-Qulí Khán] the Sardár-Muʿazam353 served
> as the governor-general of Kirmánsháh, and his political proclivities
> inclined him toward German policies. In the company of a number of
> nationalists who were deeply against the British imperialist involvement in
> Iran, he came to Burázján by way of Bihbahán. His intention was to join
> forces with [Ismáʿíl Khán,] the Sawlatuʾd-Dawlih [Qashqáʾí] and to form
> a sovereign rule in the southern region of Iran, completely independent
> of Tihrán’s control. He determined that the main obstacle in achieving his
> goal was the presence of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk, the Nasruʾd-Dawlih, Mírzá
> Muhammad-Báqir Khán Dihqán, and a few others. As such, he decided
to remove these personages from the scene.

It was during this time that Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán was sum-
> moned by ʿAbduʾl-Bahá to the Holy Land. Though he personally wished
> to obey the Master’s instruction, nevertheless, he consulted with the
> Qavámuʾl-Mulk. Considering all the commotion that surrounded them
> as result of the anticipated threats directed by the new governor and the
> fact that Dihqán’s presence was critical to the Qavám’s operations, the
> latter persuaded Dihqán to postpone this journey and advised against it.

However, it was then that a cable was received by Bashíru’s-Sultán from

Various sources refer to him alternatively as either the Sálár-Muʿazam or Sardár-
Muʿazam.

> ʿAbduʾl-Bahá, which read, “Shíráz Bashiru’s-Sultán. Immediately dispatch
the director of the Post Oﬃce, Muhammad-Baqir Khan.”

Instantly, the Bashíru’s-Sultán went to Dihqán’s residence and presented
> him with the text of this telegraph, adding, “You must leave [for Haifa] at
> once! No one knows what wisdom lies concealed in the Master’s instruc-
tion, and it behooves you to faithfully obey.”

This time, Mírzá [Muhammad-] Báqir Khán did not discuss the matter
> with anyone, and within twelve hours he left Shíráz for Búshihr that very
> night. In Burázján he happened to come upon the camp of the Nizámu’s-
> Saltanih and the Sawlatuʾd-Dawlih. The latter advised the governor to
> arrest Dihqán, but rejecting this plea, he responded, “If we were to seize
> him, the Qavám brothers would become aware of our plans for subduing
> them upon reaching Shíráz, which is our primary objective, and its execu-
> tion would become an insurmountable task. Further, Dihqán is leaving
> the country at the present and is no threat to our purposes. When the
> Qaváms have been removed from the scene, then Dihqan is insigniﬁcant.
> Therefore, it is best to allow him leave quietly.” As such, Dihqán was saved
> and quickly left Iran, and it was then that the wisdom of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s
emphatic instruction for his immediate departure became evident.354

In short, Dihqán proceeded to the Holy land and met the Greatest
> Holy Leaf [in Haifa]. Afterwards, he left for Paris where he attained the
> presence of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá. When the region presented him no further
> threats, he returned to Shíráz during the First World War after an absence
of some four or ﬁve years.

The arrival of the Sálár-Muʿazam, accompanied by the Sawlatuʾd-Dawlih
> and one thousand Qashqáʾí cavalry, caused enormous chaos and disorder
> in Shíráz.355 Soon, disorder and disturbances spread to the surrounding
> towns and villages in Fárs. The new governor arrested the Qavám brothers
> and banished them to Europe. However, en route, the Nasruʾd-Dawlih
> was slain at the hand of the Qashqáʾí tribesmen,356 but his older brother,
> Habíbuʾlláh Khán, escaped through an unfrequented road and succeeded in
> reaching the British Embassy, where he sought and received protection.

See Muʾayyad, Khátirát Habíb, vol. 1, pp. 89–90, or its translation in Rabbani, Eight
Years Near ʿAbduʾl-Bahá, chapter 3, where Dihqán’s safe arrival at Beirut is reported.

According to his biography in Bámdád, Sharh Hál Rijál Iran, vol. 2, pp. 31–34,
> Ridá-Qulí Khán (AH 1286–1343/AD1869–1924) was the governor of Fárs from 1329
to the beginning of AH 1330 [circa December 1911].

The Sawlatuʾd-Dawlih was the chief of the Qashqáʾí tribe, and this assassination
took place at his instigation.

The Governorship of the Mukhbiru’s-Saltanih Hidáyat

> During the rule of the governor [Hájí Mihdí-Qulí Khán, the] Mukhbiru’s-
> Saltanih, no particular event aﬀecting the Baháʾís took place in Shíráz and
> the province of Fárs.357

The Governorship of the Farmán-Farmá

> Of the occurrences during the tenure of ʿAbduʾl-Husayn Mírzá, the
> Farmán-Farmá,358 two incidents are particularly noteworthy, as they had
> the potential to become a serious hazard to the [Baháʾí] community.
> However, through ever-present divine protection and the foresight of
> the Farmán-Farmá and Mírzá Fadluʾlláh Khán Banán, known as Hakim
> Banán, both were quietly defused.

> First Event
> This incident involved Siyyid Asaduʾlláh Isfahání, who had adopted the
> sobriquet “Bulbul” [nightingale]. One day when he happened to pass
> through the Bazaar Vakíl, because he was a Baháʾí, the rabble commenced
> harassing and cursing him, and to wax presumptuous towards the person
> of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá. Being young and unwilling to bear such insults, he retali-
> ated to their scorns, and soon a ﬁght broke out that caused him some
> injuries. Under the pretext that he had spoken irreverently towards the
> Qurʾán and the sacred religion of Islam, he was seized and taken to the
> presence of Shaykh Jaʿfar Mahallátí. After further punishment, Shaykh
> Jaʿfar ordered him conﬁned until such time that a fatwá for his death
could be issued.

At that time, Mírzá Fadluʾlláh Banán occupied the post of the ﬁrst
> secretary of the British Consulate and was an inﬂuential ﬁgure in Shíráz.
> Quickly, he informed the Farmán-Farmá of the details and asked for his
> intercession. The governor wrote to Shaykh Jaʿfar reiterating that the cap-
> ture and punishment of rebellious elements resided with the magistrates,
> and it was that oﬃce, empowered by both religious and secular law,

He was the governor-general of Fárs from AH 1330 to 1333 [1914]; for a biography

> which was to investigate the matter. Further, the Farmán-Farmá warned
> the mujtahid, “Restraining citizens in your stable, as has been reported in
> this case, could be a serious oﬀense, and criminal charges could be ﬁled
> against your own person. As I do not wish inconvenience to be brought
> upon you, kindly send forth the imprisoned youth with the same mes-
> senger bearing this note so that he may be subject to the due process of
> law and sentenced accordingly.” Having been left with no recourse, the
Shaykh released Siyyid Asaduʾlláh to the custody of the oﬃcial.

The following evening, the Farmán-Farmá summoned Siyyid Asaduʾlláh
> to his oﬃce and released him to Mírzá Fadluʾlláh Khán. He further advised
> him to send the young Siyyid out of Shíráz. As such, the Siyyid went to
> India where he lived for well over twenty years. Later he returned to Shíráz
> and tarried there until he passed away to the Abhá Kingdom.

> Second Event
> Through the collective eﬀort of Sulaymán Shakybá of Isfahán, Mírzá
> Fadluʾlláh Khán Afnán<171>, and Mírzá Munír Nabílzádih, Dr.
> Muhammad-Báqir Húshyár was brought to the shore of certitude. From
> the very beginning, he set out to teach the Faith of God with indescrib-
> able zeal and unmatched audacity and courage. Soon, he decided on the
> conversion of Shaykh Jaʿfar Mahallátí. He took a copy of the Kitáb-i
> Íqán for the mujtahid and asked him to produce convincing reply that
> would suﬃciently reject the claim of the Baháʾís. He added, “The more
> I consider the contents of this Book, the more evident it is that every
> word of it is consistent with the Qurʾán and the Islamic Traditions. As
> such, I personally see no room for refutation. However, I would like to
have you consider the matter attentively.”

Wise to his intent, the Shaykh caused a huge uproar and ordered his
> immediate bastinado. Afterwards, Dr. Húshyár was sent to the police,
> while outside the building a large demonstration by the unruly elements
> was organized by the Shaykh. Once more, Mírzá Fadluʾlláh Khán Banán
> appealed to the Farmán-Farmá for assistance and rescue. The governor
> instructed the police commissioner, Hájí Masʿuduʾd-Dawlih, that, should
> Mírzá Fadluʾlláh Khán come to the magistrates, to comply with his
> requests. Banán went to the police headquarters and asked to speak with
> Dr. Húshyár, who had been brought in earlier. Upon entering the oﬃce
> of the police chief, Banán said, “This man will be my guest this evening
> and tomorrow, and I will deliver him to your charge on Saturday.”

In such wise, Húshyár was released from conﬁnement and led to Ustád
> Muhammad Miʿmár Khayrándísh’s home, which was situated near the
> Kázirún Gate. Through the eﬀorts of Banán, he was sent out of Shíráz

education.

The Governorship of the Musaddiqu’s-Saltanih

The Governorship of the Nusratuʾd-Dawlih

> A brother-in-law of Ahmad Sháh, the Nusratuʾd-Dawlih360 was appointed
> governor-general of Fárs, and two important incidents took place during
his reign that were related to the Baháʾí Faith:

> The ﬁrst event stemmed from the severe beating and viliﬁcation that Mírzá
> Nasru’lláh Khán Ázádigan of Jahrum received in the Bazaar Vakíl, and the
details are as follows:

One day when Mírzá Nasru’lláh Khán was on his way to work in the post
> oﬃce, one of the assistants in a cloth-dealer’s shop made certain slanderous
> remarks about his [Bahá’í] beliefs that he ventured to answer. As such, a
> number of shopkeepers attacked him with crowbars, scissors, and metallic
> rulers. After some time, he succeeded in freeing himself and, bloody and
covered in injuries, gained his way back to the post oﬃce.

This event was immediately reported to Prince Muhammad-Ridá Mírzá,
> the Muqarrib, a staunch and devoted Bahá’í who directed the powerful post
> oﬃce. On hearing the details, he ordered the immediate suspension of the
> postal system of the province, which was to remain in eﬀect until such time

would resume work.

In response to this public outcry, the Nusratuʾd-Dawlih summoned

accepted and an order issued for the arrest of the villain.

The following day, in the presence of a multitude that included the gov-

> ʿAlí-Muhammad Baig, Dihqán invited the members of the Spiritual Assembly
> to a meeting that very day at his home. He had asked Áqá Muhammad-
> Hasan ʿAhdiyyih to inform me [i.e., Mírzá Habíb] and my brother Mírzá
> Buzurg of this meeting. ʿAhdiyyih came to our house and said that it must
> be a matter of great import because Dihqán invited us at such an early hour.
We left instantly, and Áqá Mírzá Áqá Faríd also joined us en route.

During that period, through hypocrisy and conniving, ʿAbduʾl-Husayn
> Taríqatí had managed to get elected to the Spiritual Assembly even though he
> was one of the principals in the Itihád Islámí Society. Constantly, he leaked
> news of the community and of the consultations of the Spiritual Assembly
> to his comrades. Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán was deeply suspicious of
> him and had expressed the hope that the friends would not re-elect him,
but on that day, he was still a member of our Spiritual Assembly.

When we arrived at Dihqán’s residence, we immediately discerned from
> his downcast condition and reddened eyes that the news perturbing him
> so profoundly must be none other than the ascension of our Beloved. In
> response to our inquiry about communications from the Holy Land, in a
> voice ﬁlled with sorrow, he read to us the telegram from the Greatest Holy
> Leaf. The state of anguish and distress that overcame each one of us is truly
> indescribable. Deeply shaken by the news, our sorrow and grief knew no
> bounds. In an instant, all His loving memories, His brilliant visage, His
> heavenly tones, everything that had made Him more precious than life itself,
passed before my eyes. How could life go on without Him?

While each one was expressing his sincerely felt loss, Taríqatí, however,
> was displaying unusual distress, quite foreign to a Baháʾí way of bereavement
> and Baháʾí dignity. This hypocritical sanctimoniousness at such a momentous
> time deeply angered Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán. He asked Taríqatí to
> withhold such unseemly demonstrations, stating, “Now is not the time for
> mourning in such manner, as we must think of ways to save and protect
> the community from the injuries aimed at it by unrelenting enemies. Of
> a certainty, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá must have appointed a worthy successor for the
> preservation and the guardianship of the one true Faith of God. We have
> to wait until instructions are received from the Holy Land.” He further
> suggested that this matter be kept conﬁdential until such time as we could
> wisely announce His passing together with the news of His succession.
> Moreover, Dihqán emphasized, “Care must be exercised that this news does
> not reach the enemies of the Faith who would ﬁnd it an opportune time to
> once again cause disturbances and to harm the believers.” Everyone readily
agreed with these prudent measures.

Immediately after the meeting, however, Taríqatí, who at the time was
> a superintendent at the post oﬃce, made this news known to the Itihád
> Islámí, and the next day the city was ﬁlled with the cry, “The God of the
> Bábís is dead!” Under such circumstances, the clergy, especially Shaykh Jaʿfar
> Mahallátí, Mullá Hasan Qannád, Shaykh Murtidá, and Siyyid Muhammad
> Faly, who were inﬂuential and served as the marjaʿ taqlíd [i.e., the Shiʿites’
> source of emulation], saw a perfect opportunity to commence disturbances
> and to attain their long-cherished goal of the destruction of Baháʾí Holy
> Places, particularly, the House of the Báb. Also, on their mind was pillage

> of the business oﬃce of Muhammad-Hasan ʿAhdiyyih and the residence
of Dihqán.

When their intentions were noised through the people in the streets and
> the bazaars, we became aware of it as well. Members of the Spiritual Assembly
> gathered in the oﬃce of Áqá Muhammad-Hasan ʿAhdiyyih for an emergency
> consultation, and we all were bewildered as to how this news had leaked
> outside the community. The Spiritual Assembly decided to have Dihqán and
I consult [privately] on this matter and put forward a proposal.

Dihqán was a very kind and considerate man, but when he perceived
> an issue against the good of the Spiritual Assembly, then he would become
> visibly agitated and was prone to ﬁts of anger. I was chosen for this consulta-
> tion partly because he observed utmost regards towards me. When the two
> of us sat down to discuss the situation, he began by shouting, “I have said
> over and over that Taríqatí is a conniving liar and is nothing but a cheap
> informer for the enemies of the Faith. Yet, the Spiritual Assembly is so gull-
> ible that it allows him to attend the meetings and to spy on our aﬀairs!”
> He paused for a minute and then asked, “Where are the other members
> of the Spiritual Assembly?” “They are gathered in the oﬃce of ʿAhdiyyih,”
> I replied. He thought again and said, “Notify them to come to my house
[for a meeting] and be sure to tell Taríqatí as well.”

Within a short time, they all arrived. When everyone was present, Dihqán
> powerfully addressed the Spiritual Assembly in these words, “I had imagined
> that this Spiritual Assembly, when asked, was capable of keeping matters
> conﬁdential and had not realized that some members were such impostors
> that they would take the decisions to outsiders.” He continued to speak with
> much heat and anger, “Although the Spiritual Assembly had decided that for
> the time being it must emphatically keep the news of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s ascen-
> sion conﬁdential, yet that news has spread throughout the city. The mullás
> are now busy planning sedition and injury to the Baháʾís. However, this
> time they have grievously miscalculated! This is because after ʿAbduʾl-Bahá,
> I no longer wish to live. I will dedicate all my [considerable] possessions to
> combating the mullás and to exacting a revenge for eighty years of wrong
> that these contemptible jurists have perpetrated against the innocent believ-
> ers! ʿAbduʾl-Bahá is no longer in this world to bridle the aﬀairs of the Faith
> and to control its members through such admonishments as, ‘It behoveth
> us to kiss the hand of the would-be assassin and to set out, dancing, on
> our way to the habitation of the Friend.ʾ362 Now that with their custom-
> ary treachery and deceit, the ʿulamá have set out to destroy the Baháʾí
> community and to plunder my house, I will not sit quietly. I will avenge
> the past and will ensure that whosoever leaked this matter to our enemies
> receives the just chastisement that he deserves! Rest assured that I intend
to spill much blood!”

He then asked the Spiritual Assembly’s secretary, Áqá Mírzá Fadluʾlláh, the
Hakím-Banán, to send a message on his behalf to all the [Baháʾí] chieftains

> of various villages that they at once send to Shíráz all available riﬂemen
> under their command. Dihqán also wrote to the following: Mullá Husayn
> Khán, the Kad-Khudá of Qallát; Mullá ʿAlí Áqá, the Kad-Khudá of Zákhird;
> the Kalántar and Kad-Khudás of Marv-Dasht, such as Fadl-ʿAlí Khán and
> others; and Mírzá Husayn-ʿAlí Khán, the Kalántar of Sarvistán. To all of
> these men, he emphatically conveyed his instructions to send their gunmen
> immediately to Shíráz. Having signed and sealed these directives, he ordered
> his attendants to deliver the communications and went so far to tell the
> one destined for Sarvistán to convey it with the greatest haste. Of course,
> he was stating all his commands in the most heightened and angered voice,
accompanied with repeated poundings of his ﬁst on the table.

Having completed these tasks, he then addressed the Spiritual Assembly
> with the same wrath, “The existence of a Spiritual Assembly that cannot
> protect its own discussions is of no use. Indeed, not having one is bet-
> ter than having one. Given the situation, I no longer need a secretary or
> advisors, and hereby [as the Spiritual Assembly’s chairman] dissolve this
> Spiritual Assembly.”363 With this comment, he dismissed everyone, but
kept me behind.

After the other members of the Spiritual Assembly left his residence, he
> said to me, “I meant no disrespect toward any of the Spiritual Assembly
> members, as my sole purpose was to make it known to this miserable
> hypocrite [i.e., Taríqatí] that we are aware of his two-faced activities and to
> force his departure from the Spiritual Assembly. Kindly convey my heartfelt
> apologies to other members of the Spiritual Assembly and tell them that as
needs arise, I am at their immediate disposal.”

Having realized that he had been discovered and that through Dihqán’s
> determination his life was in great peril, Taríqatí went directly to the head-
> quarters of Itihád Islámí and with much embellishment informed its members
> of all that had transpired in Dihqán’s home. He informed the mullás, “Within
> twenty-four hours, at least two thousand riﬂemen will arrive in Shíráz for
> the purpose of slaughtering all the ecclesiastics, members of Itihád Islámí,
> and anyone who has previously opposed the Baháʾís. Therefore, it is best that
> for now we postpone our plans for the elimination of these wayward people
> and wait for another opportune moment. Otherwise, there is every chance
> that we would suﬀer mercilessly in the ensuing battles.” Hearing this report
> and learning of Dihqán’s resolution to use his vast inﬂuence and wealth to
> confront them particularly frightened the ʿulamá, and in no time they had
collectively decided to remain quiet and see what was in store.

Next morning, nineteen Baháʾí riﬂemen from the village of Qallát arrived
in Shíráz. Dihqán instructed them to disperse in the city and purchase

> the men to the House of the Báb with instructions to protect that Sacred
> Ediﬁce from the rooftop. He further sent ﬁve men to the oﬃce and home
> of ʿAhdiyyih, and placed the last seven on the roof of his own residence.
> Gradually, a number of other Baháʾís from the surrounding region joined
their ranks.

The city’s inhabitants conveyed the news of the occurrences to the ʿulamá,
> who, deeply perturbed at the turn of events, took refuge with the Nusratu’s-
> Saltanih and the Qavámul-Mulk. The governor summoned Dihqán and
> in the presence of the clerics questioned him regarding these happenings.
> Without the least trace of fear or hesitation, Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán
> told him everything that had transpired. He even went as far as threaten-
> ing the governor, saying, “Within the next twenty-four hours I will array
> more guns and men in this city than you know what to do with. And
> then I will exact a long-awaited revenge from these despicable mullás.” The
> evident determination of Dihqán had indeed profoundly frightened the

> apologetically, solemnly giving their assurance that no harm was to come
> to any Baháʾí life or property. They begged Dihqán to forget and forgive
this “misunderstanding,” to which he agreed.

It was thus through Dihqán’s bravery and willingness to face cowardly
> foes that this particular threat to the Faith was alleviated and the situation

Continued Agitation of Itihád Islámí Society

> Notwithstanding the oath taken by the ʿulamá to leave the Baháʾís alone,
> the Itihád Islámí did not desist from its activities [against the Baháʾí Faith]
> and never missed an opportunity to insult or injure the believers. In this
> regard, one of the merchants of the bazaar, Hájí Muhammad-Ismáʿil
> Kázirúní, was most active and in every way possible sought to harm the
> Cause. He was particularly antagonistic toward the Baháʾí ﬁresides led by
> Mírzá Munír Nabílzádeh364 where this devoted and enthusiastic teacher
> spoke. The news of these meetings and the zeal of Nabílzádih constantly
> induced the members of the Itihád Islámí to protestation and machina-
> tion. Led by Kázirúní, they endeavored to raise a popular revolt in the
> bazaar against the believers.

One of the foremost teachers of the Baháʾí Faith, Nabílzádih had come to Shíráz some
time earlier and regularly held very popular ﬁresides meetings at his own residence.

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 236                                                                                  7/10/2008 2:44:12 PM

In those days a group of ardent Baháʾí young men, such as ʿAbduʾl-
> Husayn Satarí, ʿAbduʾlláh Madaraʾí, Sulaymán Shakíbá,365 Fathuʾlláh
> Afnán, Nusratuʾlláh Badrí-Afnán, Siyyid Abúʾl-Qásim Páyandih, and a
> few others would gather every night at the Khál Aʿzam’s house, one of
> the Baháʾí endowments. Previously, they had served for many years in the
> South Persian Regiment and as such were well familiar with the use of
> weapons. They spent their time planning armed attacks on various groups
> of opponents of the Faith. Repeatedly, Mírzá Munír admonished them as
> to the folly of their designs, noting that were they actually to implement
> their plans, this could bring complete ruin upon the Baháʾís of Shíráz and
> could potentially endanger the entire Baháʾí community of Iran. Though
> these young men were generally not impressed by Nabílzádih’s appeal for
> paciﬁsm, he had, however, managed to exact a promise that they would
consult the Spiritual Assembly before taking any steps.
Áqá Mírzá Munír related to the author [i.e., A.Q. Afnán] the following:

> Realizing the gravity of the situation, I went to the Spiritual Assembly meet-
> ing, which was taking place in the house of Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí Khán
> Dihqán, and related the story and the plan of the young men. I further
> left my own pistol on the table round which the Spiritual Assembly had
> gathered. After their deliberation, the Spiritual Assembly decided to send
> your father [i.e., Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh] and me to the house of the Khál to
ﬁnd a way to disarm and disperse these believers.

About two hours into the night we arrived at the house of the martyred-
> uncle and with the utmost respect spoke to the honored gentlemen, “There
> is no question that generation after generation, Baháʾís in every village,
> every town, and every corner in this land have been made the target of
> the most brutal tyranny and the torment of the ungodly. In addition, it
> is indubitable that the blood of countless martyrs and innocent men and
> women has reddened every inch of Iran’s soil. Nor is anyone denying the
> pain and the suﬀering that multitudes of families must endure for a great
> many years after they have lost their loved ones. However, were an armed
> aggression to be initiated by someone in Shíráz, you can rest assured that the
> entire country will be engulfed in a massive holocaust of Baháʾí-killing. Do
> you really imagine that a city or town would be left where a single believer
> can reside or remain standing? Nay, if this powder were lit, it would most
> assuredly explode in our own hands and can never be extinguished. The
> only way to survival for this community is to remain paciﬁst, as enjoined
> upon us by the Blessed Perfection. Otherwise, in an instant, we would be
obliterated.”

For a while we spoke and reasoned in such manner, and this helped some
to grow acquiescent, but a few remained wedded to their militant views.

For a biography, see Sulaymání, Masábih Hidáyat, vol. 9, pp. 123–94.

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 237                                                                             7/10/2008 2:44:12 PM

> Finally, your father [i.e., Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh] calmly said to them, “I have
> been commissioned by the Spiritual Assembly to conﬁscate your guns and
> ammunition. You have no alternative but to obey the Assembly’s wish.” All
> except Abúʾl-Qásim Páyandih placed their guns on the table, however, he was
> insistent that he would not part with his weapon. Eventually, we prevailed,

Dissemination of the Will and Testament of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá

> My father used to relate that the Master’s Will and Testament was ﬁrst
> unveiled at a commemorative meeting that took place at the home of
> Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí Khán Dihqán. My father read to the assembled
> friends the ﬁrst half of the Will, and the second half was recited by
> ʿAbduʾl-Husayn Khán Dihqán, who had just arrived from Beirut. When
> the reading of the Text was concluded, Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán
> prostrated himself on the ground and then raised his hands in thankful-
> ness to ʿAbduʾl-Bahá, saying, “Shoghi Eﬀendi is related to the Twin Holy
> Trees and is of the Holy Lineage. We all bow in obedience before him;
> we all render thanks unto him; we all show humility before him; we all
> believe and rely on him; and we all stand assured and conﬁdent because
> of him. We verily testify that ʿAbduʾl-Bahá is the all-knowing protector
> of this community, and none was nearer to Him or loved more dearly
> by Him than Shoghi Eﬀendi. Before the sovereign will of Shoghi Eﬀendi
we prostrate ourselves in submissiveness.”

This expression of humility and obedience by Dihqán, coupled with
> his act of prostration in thankfulness, had a profound eﬀect on the
> friends, and tears of joy and happiness were shed on that day. That day,
> once more Baháʾuʾlláh worked His miracle, and our sorrow for the loss
> of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá was transmuted into joy of bliss, celebrating the person
of Shoghi Eﬀendi.

Unanimously, the gathering decided to write a letter to the presence
> of the beloved Guardian expressing the community’s servitude unto his
> threshold.

Baháʾí Martyrdom in Jahrum

> The improprieties in the election of the Iranian Majlis Shawrá Millí
> [national consultative parliament] caused political upheaval in Jahrum,
> which precipitated serious divisions between the two opposing factions

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 238                                                                           7/10/2008 2:44:12 PM

> in the year 1305 Sh366 [1926]. One of the factions consisted of the fol-
> lowers of [Ismáʿil Khán] Sawlatuʾd-Dawlih, the chief of Qashqáʾí tribe,
> who harbored ambitions for national oﬃce.367 His supporters launched a
> massive political campaign in Jahrum that triggered a huge uproar, creat-
> ing a charged atmosphere that led to conditions ripe for the persecution
of Baháʾís.

In those days Mírzá Lutf-ʿAlí Khán, the Mudyruʾd-Dawlih, was the
> governor of Jahrum, while Akbar Mírzá, the Sarimuʾd-Dawlih, was the
> governor-general of Fárs and Amír-Lashkar Mahmúd Ayram held the post
> of military commander of Fárs. The followers of the Sawlatuʾd-Dawlih in
> Jahrum were such individuals as Siyyid ʿAlí [Píshnámz],368 Karbaláʾí Siyyid
> Habíb Jahrumí, Siyyid ʿAlí Muʿizz, and his brother Siyyid Muhammad-Sadr
> Qadr-Qadr. To divert attention from their fraud, they started an intense,
> brutal persecution of the friends, and in the process eight Baháʾís were
> martyred.369 These innocent souls were slain in the most barbaric manner
imaginable through stabbing, beating, and stoning.370

A written report of the parlous incident was sent to the Sarimuʾd-
> Dawlih and his military commander, General Mahmúd Ayram. Tihrán
> was also made fully aware of these details and a report presented to Reza
> Sháh, the new sovereign, who ordered an immediate thorough investiga-
> tion. From Shíráz, Major General Sultán Sayfuʾlláh Himat was charged to
> proceed to Jahrum to carry out the monarch’s directive and to prosecute
the oﬀending individuals.

Over the years on many occasions, the present author has heard Major
General Himat describe his eﬀorts in these words:

> After the governor communicated the orders to me, thirty soldiers were
> placed at my disposal for this mission. When we arrived in Jahrum, I
> immediately moved to arrest several of the Baháʾís, thereby winning the
> conﬁdence of the local Muslims. I then began my investigation and after
> two days discovered the identity of the criminal elements who had commit-
> ted these reprehensible oﬀenses. Instantly, orders were issued for their arrest,

Sh stands for Shamsí, which is a solar-based calendar used mostly in Iran.

At the time, he was a parliamentarian from Jahrum, but the tide of the election
was going against him; therefore, he resorted to cheating.

He was the son and the successor of Siyyid ʿAbduʾl-Husayn Lárí, the instigator of
the Baháʾí persecutions of 1909 in Nayríz.

The eight Baháʾí martyrs were: Siyyid Husayn Ruhání; Ustád ʿAbbás; Muhammad-
> Kázim; Muhammad-Hasan; Muhammad-Shafíʿ; Mashhadí ʿAbbás; Ustád Muhammad-
Hasan; and Muhammad-Ridá.

> Because of the intense persecution of the believers and the martyrdom

> However, in the same year, a communication was received from the beloved
> Guardian who showered his loving benevolence on the much-wronged
> believers of Jahrum and encouraged them to remain undaunted and to
> resume their activities. He further instructed the Spiritual Assembly of

Hasan Balyúzí in Shíráz

> In the summer of 1309 Sh [1930], my deeply loved cousin [later, Hand
> of the Cause] Hasan Múvaqqar Balyúzí, arrived in Shíráz from Beirut
> for the purpose of visiting his family. Greatly excited at the prospect,

> themes of his presentation were to be: the diﬀusion of the Cause in the
> West, the tidings from the Holy Land, and the Beirut students’ visit to
> the presence of the beloved Guardian. The Youth Committee capitalized
> on this opportunity and invited the whole community, young and old
alike, to this historic gathering.

In those days all Baháʾí activities were conducted in Hájí Mírzá Siyyid
> ʿAlí, the Khál Aʿzam’s house, which was designated by ʿAbduʾl-Bahá as

> Naw, as well as being in the proximity of another Baháʾí Holy Place, that

identity of the participants.

For that occasion, the carpet-seller had invited a group of the oppo-
> nents of the Baháʾí Faith to his house. The meeting at the Khál Aʿzam’s
> house started with the chanting of an opening prayer after which the
> chairman introduced Mr. Balyúzí, and the latter came to the podium.
> However, before he could commence speaking, a large rock was hurled

> on the podium. Naturally, the meeting disbanded. At that moment foes
> quickly descended from the roof and were joined by some other thugs
> who had been expecting the signal and had been waiting in the street,
> and together they attacked the friends. The believers also rushed forth in
> their own defense, and a ﬁerce commotion ensued. The long corridor371
> of the building became the scene of a very intense battle, and several of
> the friends suﬀered serious injuries. However, soon the friends managed
> to overpower their foes and disarm the attackers. The young among
> the Baháʾís lost no time in using the same clubs and sticks against the
instigators.372

The friends immediately informed Lutfuʾlláh Khán Munajjim, who was a
> very inﬂuential man and had a senior position in the police department.373
> He quickly went to the magistrate’s headquarters and spoke threateningly
> to the chief of police, the Diyáʾu’s-Sultán, inducing the latter into action.
> In no time, he came to us in the company of several gendarmes, and they

The old houses in Shíráz had an underground corridor that connected the main
entrance to the courtyard. Presumably, a similar passageway is being referred to here.

Parenthetically, A.Q. Afnán notes: “For many years the pistols and clubs conﬁscated
> from the attackers were kept in the oﬃce of the Spiritual Assembly as a reminder of that
incident.”

A.Q. Afnán (private communication, December 1995) clariﬁed that Munajjim was
an attorney who served in what today may be considered the general prosecutor’s oﬃce.

> with intent to kill against the entire group of the enemies, and their ﬁle
was sent to the judiciary.

The transgressors were detained for several more days until the court
> was ready to hear their case and try them for the crimes committed. Of
> course, by then the entire city was astir with the news, and all sorts of
> rumors were circulating among the people. What was most evident was
> that the entire town was put on notice that if they inequitably dealt with
> Baháʾís, or any other group, then the full force of the law would deal
with the oﬀenders.

In preparation for the court trial, a deposition was organized in the
> Central Judiciary Building where the highest echelon of the provincial
> government were in attendance, men like the governor-general of Fárs,
> Akbar Mírzá, the Sarimuʾd-Dawlih; the military commander, General
> Ayram; the chief magistrate; the State’s public defender, Sarábandí; and
> heads of various departments. Munajjim was also invited to represent the
interests of the Faith and to speak on behalf of Baháʾís.

At the start of the deliberations, Munajjim spoke strenuously, stating the
> need to punish the oﬀenders to the full extent of the law so that people
> would thoroughly realize that during the reign of Reza Sháh Pahlaví it
> was the law that ruled and the tyranny of the mullás was at long last a
> nightmare of the past. He spoke most eﬀectively of the dark cloud of
> injustice that for so many centuries enveloped the horizon of Iran in the
> name of the Shiʿite ecclesiastics and ijtihád. Moreover, he spoke of the
> need to set an example so that a heedless population would be awakened
> to the civil liberties guaranteed under the law for each person and the
right of Baháʾís to assemble unmolested.

In his presentation, Sarábandí responded by completely agreeing with
> every point raised by the prosecution. However, he appealed on humani-
> tarian grounds, stating, “These oﬀenders, though unquestionably guilty of
> the heinous act with which they are charged, nevertheless, have families
> for whom they must provide. If they were sent to prison, then surely
> their wives and children would suﬀer greatly as well and remain in dire
> need of their daily bread. In fact, as these men have been jailed during
> the past few days, their families are already perturbed and experiencing
> many diﬃculties. I am certain that the honored Munajjim wishes not
> to see innocent children suﬀer and prefers forgiveness to vengeance. As
> such, as the public defender for the province, I ask forgiveness for the
> transgressions committed and the dropping of the charges. My clients
> will not only pay for all the damages but also provide the court with a

> written guarantee that they will never again commit such deeds. I beg of
you to let them go free and close this case.”

As a gesture of Baháʾí magnanimity, Munajjim consented for the charges
> to be dismissed, which greatly heightened the prestige of the Faith in the
> eyes of the public and won the esteem and admiration of the assembled
high-ranking oﬃcials.

In short, although that night Balyúzí was not able to deliver his speech,

Endowments of the House of the Báb

> In the year 1315 Sh [1936], Hájí Siyyid Muhammad<46>, a son of the
> Vakíluʾd-Dawlih, donated part of his estate in Tihrán [in the Shimrán
> district] for the purpose of renovating the Blessed House of the Báb. He
> transferred the legal deeds of these properties, recorded as worth 500,000
> tumáns,374 to the beloved Guardian. Because of the unusual nature of this
> contribution, the details were reported to Reza Sháh Pahlaví who was told,
> “The recipient of this sum is not a resident of Iran, and the actual value
> of the properties is far beyond what has been recorded in the deed.” The
monarch ordered a thorough investigation.

It is unknown to me how the police grew cognizant of this situation,
> but as a result, Siyyid Muhammad was summoned for the investigation
> and questioned regarding the transaction. Without stipulating any refer-
> ence to the House of the Báb or to Shoghi Eﬀendi, he had replied, “For
> many years I have had commercial dealings in Shíráz with a close relative,
> Áqá Mírzá Hádí.375 I had purchased these properties with his money and,
> now that he is in the evening of his life, wish to reimburse the sum so I
> will not be under the weight of such obligations.”

The actual value of these lands went into the millions and represented an excep-
> tional contribution for that period. It should be borne in mind that the Vakíluʾd-Dawlih
> ranked among the wealthiest citizens, and only a fraction of his vast estate had previously
> been used for the construction of the Temple in ʿIshqábád. Even though this gift was
> earmarked for the House of the Báb, it was clearly meant as a general contribution to
> the Baháʾí International Fund, as the needs of the House of the Báb were considerably
less than this amount.

Shoghi Eﬀendi’s father.

Despite his testimony, the police had mentioned in their report to
> the Sháh that this contribution was to establish a very sizeable religious
> endowment associated with the House of the Báb. Through this report,
> the matter had become even more serious, and the governor-general of
> Fárs, the Prince Dawlatsháhí, was instructed to visit the House of the
> Báb for a thorough determination and to report his ﬁndings directly to
> the royal court. As such, Dawlatsháhí, the police commissioner, as well
> as Lutﬁ-ʿAlí Muʿadil, the provincial deputy to the national parliament,
> came to the House of the Báb and were welcomed by my father [Mírzá
> Habíbuʾlláh]. These distinguished guests were received in the same room
> designated for the arrival and welcome of the pilgrims. After the customary
> pleasantries, with the utmost respect the visiting gentlemen requested the
> privilege of viewing the House of the Siyyid-i-Báb. My father led them
on a tour of the House.

After having expressed their appreciation for the remarkable air of
> spirituality and beauty that surrounded every aspect of that House, they
> asked, “Where are the endowment properties associated with this House?”
> “In the Baháʾí Faith,” my father had replied, “There is no such thing as
> endowments for Holy Places. The general funds of the Cause pay for the
> maintenance and upkeep of all such properties throughout the world.”
> They further queried, “It has recently come to our attention that one of
> your relatives has endowed some of his properties in Tihrán speciﬁcally
> for this House.” Not knowing anything about this contribution, my father
expressed his lack of knowledge.

“Are you acquainted with Hájí Mírzá Muhammad in Tihrán?” they
> asked. My father responded, “Yes, indeed. He is a close relative and one
> of distinguished members of the Afnán family.” The governor stated, “This
> individual has donated a considerable amount of land in Tihrán in the
> name of Shoghi Eﬀendi, the Head of the Baháʾís.” Unaware of any such
> thing, my father was inspired to reply, “I have not been told of this, nor
> has he written me about it. However, I have frequently heard him say
> that he owed money to Áqá Siyyid [Muhammad-] Husayn<37> and Áqá
> Mírzá Hádí<96> from the time that they had business dealings in Shíráz
> and that he wished to repay his debt. Therefore, it seems likely that he
was merely repaying his debt.”

The visitor continued to inquire further about the history of the House
of the Báb, the number of pilgrims, and other similar matters. My father

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 244                                                                   7/10/2008 2:44:14 PM

> had replied, “This was the residence of the Siyyid-i-Báb and is considered
> by Baháʾís the holiest site in the whole of Iran. I, being a blood relation
> of the Báb, have been the hereditary-custodian of this Ediﬁce since the
> passing of my father. Baháʾís from diﬀerent parts of Iran and the rest of
> the world come for visitation to this House and are welcomed and given
the same reception that you enjoyed today.”

The governor further asked, “How do you manage to meet the required
> expenses associated with welcoming visitors and maintaining the House?”
> “From the return on the business interests and the properties that I have
> inherited from my mother’s family, I am able to meet such obligations.
> The details of my personal estate are well-known to the honored Muʿadil.”
> At that point Muʿadil had spoken extensively, extolling the sagacity, the
> trustworthiness, and the nobility of the Afnán family, and on this note
the meeting had concluded.

Upon their departure, my father had immediately communicated
> the gist of the interview to Siyyid Muhammad in Tihrán so that in the
> event that he was also questioned, their answers would be consistent. In
> a response cable, Hájí Mírzá Muhammad, after expressing immense aﬀec-
> tion and humility, had said that he, too, had replied in the same manner
and that both were guided by Baháʾuʾlláh in this regard.

Since the governor’s report contained the same exact details that were
> said by Siyyid Muhammad, Reza Sháh did not pursue the matter any
> further, and the whole incident quieted down.

The Centenary Celebration of the Báb’s Declaration

> The year 1323 Sh [1944] corresponded with the centennial celebration
> of the Declaration of the Báb, and the beloved Guardian wished to mark
> the event most appropriately throughout the world. For the West, he had
> labored hard for many years to produce a beﬁtting gift in the form of God
> Passes By. For the East, however, it needed to be accompanied with a dif-
> ferent form of commemorative observance. Shoghi Eﬀendi had instructed
> the delegates to the national Baháʾí convention to gather in Shíráz and hold
> a beﬁtting celebration on 23 May 1944 under the shadow of the House
> of the Báb. He had further stated that should unforeseen circumstances
> prevent their gathering in the Blessed House, then some other location
in Shíráz or its vicinity was to be used for the occasion.

Thrilled at the prospect, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʾís
of Iran decided to keep the matter conﬁdential, lest it attract the atten-

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 245                                                                  7/10/2008 2:44:14 PM

> tion of foes and provoke them into mischief. Therefore, the delegates [to
> the national convention] were not informed until ﬁfteen days before the
> event and were instructed to be in Shíráz on the appointed day without
disclosing their destination to anyone.

It was about this time that Dr. Dhabíhuʾlláh Qurbán had been expelled
> from the community, and the National Spiritual Assembly was somewhat
> concerned that certain diﬃculties would be provoked from that quarter.376
> At the same time they had received a cable from the Guardian, which
read, “Keep an eye on Shíráz Assembly.”

Later, it became apparent that the Guardian was referring to the
> dangerous presence of ʿAbduʾlláh Mustaqimí on the Spiritual Assembly,
> since through various avenues of deceit this man strove to create diﬀer-
> ences among the believers and to engender pessimism. He even went so
> far as to accuse various prominent believers of the most unseemly deeds.
> Another who was under the direct inﬂuence of Mustaqimí was Captain
Thábit-Rásikh—eventually both were expelled from the community.

In order to make arrangements for the forthcoming celebration and
> also to monitor the work of the Spiritual Assembly, [the later Hands of
> the Cause] Áqá Mírzá Vallíuʾlláh Varqá and Colonel Jalál Kháziʿ arrived
> in Shíráz about a month prior to the festivities. In the course of their
> consultation with the Spiritual Assembly, they were careful not to divulge
> anything about the centenary celebrations. The honored Varqá, however,
> conﬁdentially acquainted my father with Shoghi Eﬀendi’s wish about this
celebration and emphasized to him the need for absolute secrecy.

My father asked the women of his household to make large quantities
> of every possible kind of homemade sweetmeats, and when they asked
> about the intended purpose of these preparations, he only vaguely replied,
> “Since there will be a celebration in Tihrán, I plan to take sweets as my
oﬀering.”

A week before the centenary celebrations, the honored Varqá informed
> the Spiritual Assembly of the Guardian’s directive and the arrival of del-
> egates to Shíráz. The Spiritual Assembly immediately started to arrange
> living quarters for the anticipated guests, and the homes of the friends
> throughout Shíráz were readied. Further, in order not to draw attention

Dr. Qurbán had married a Muslim woman without a Baháʾí ceremony and had
> refused instructions to rectify the matter, and he was therefore expelled from the Baháʾí
> Faith by the Guardian. The family of Qurbán and the majority of the Dihqán clan con-
> tinued to associate with him, and one after another were excommunicated.

> to the event, all Baháʾí activities at the Hadíratuʾl-Quds were suspended,
and the pilgrims’ visits to the House of the Báb were cancelled.

The Shíráz Spiritual Assembly gave the overall responsibility for the
> arrangements to Áqá Mírzá Fadluʾlláh Hakím-Banán, who in turn selected
> a few members of the Youth Committee to aid him. His wonderful eﬀorts
> for the success of this celebration were very much appreciated by everyone,
and many other families assisted in various ways with all the details.

At last, on that sacred and holy night, the National Spiritual Assembly
> as well as ninety-three delegates to the national convention gathered in the
> hallowed vicinity of the Blessed House. The courtyards and the chambers
> of the House were illumined with so many lamps that the brightness and
luster of that glorious night dazzled the eyes.

At the beginning of the celebration, the entire congregation stood in
> attention while four specially appointed believers, that is, Vallíuʾlláh Varqá,
> Dr. Yunis Khán Afrúkhtih, Núriʾd-Dín Khán Fath-Aʿzam,377 and my father,
> went inside to spread the pure-silk carpet that was gifted for that occasion
> by the beloved Guardian. This carpet was spread in the upper chamber
> of the House of the Báb, the very spot where a hundred years earlier the
Báb had illumined the world with His Manifestation.

A few minutes before the hour of the Declaration, the honored Varqá
> announced, “Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh Afnán, as Custodian of the House of the
> Báb, will lead the assembled friends on a pilgrimage through the Sanctiﬁed
> House. We will follow his example, reverently visiting and paying homage
> to the spot where His Holiness the Primal Point was seated at the hour
> of His Declaration. Afterwards, with the utmost humility and serenity we
> will exit the House. At that time, the honored Mírzá Habíb Afnán will
> chant Baháʾuʾlláh’s Surih Hajj revealed in honor of this House, and then
the Guardian’s Lawh-i Qarn378 will be recited.”

After the visit to the House was completed, the secretary of the National
> Spiritual Assembly, ʿAlí-Akbar Furútan, recited the letter of the Guardian
> in its entirety. This luminous and heavenly celebration continued until the
> early hours of the morning, and at the end all partook of breakfast in the
> courtyard of the house adjacent to the House of the Báb. Thus, the most
> glorious and magniﬁcent celebration in the history of the Cause in Iran
> concluded in an atmosphere of the utmost joy and felicity.

The following day a group of delegates returned to their homes, while

able to once more visit the Sacred House of the Báb.

It should be noted that the necessary preparations for this splendid

The Renewal of Diﬃculties in Shíráz

> During the years 1310 to 1320 Sh [1931–41], which corresponded to the
> reign of Reza Sháh, no incidents against the Faith took place in Shíráz.
> Most meetings and large gatherings, especially the Ridván festivities,
> were celebrated in the public orchards and parks, which were protected
by the police.

However, a few years after the abdication of Reza Sháh, in the open-
> ing days of 1324 Sh [spring 1945], Siyyid Núriʾd-Dín rose in inﬂuence
> and gathered the people of Shíráz around him. His initial target was the
> House of the Báb, and he targeted it by focusing on the neighboring
> mosque.380 He would ascend the pulpits and vociferously proclaim, “O
> my brothers! There exists a small, broken mosque in the Shimshírgarhá
> Street, near the House of the Bábís. Against the wish of those who desire
> naught but the destruction and obliteration of our holy places, we must
> arise to repair this Masjid. We must build for it a beﬁtting pulpit and
> choose a worthy píshnamáz [prayer guide] to lead the congregation in
> their obligatory prayers and organize prayer vigils.” In such fashion, he
> would go on for some time and speak of the signiﬁcance of rebuilding
the mosque next to the House of the Báb.

His sermons succeeded in winning support for his designs, and several
from among his congregation proclaimed their readiness for the task and

A moving account of this event is reported in The Baháʾí World, vol. 10, pp. 181–84.

See Afnán, Memories of the Báb, Baháʾuʾlláh, and ʿAbduʾl-Bahá, chapter 11, for some
other events associated with this same mosque.

> within a few days repaired and prepared the mosque. For the inauguration,
> Siyyid Núriʾd-Dín was the honored guest, and as sign of respect, his fol-
> lowers carpeted the streets along his path and with much ostentation and
> pageantry brought him to the Masjid. He began his sermons by taking
> exception to Baháʾís and praised God that once more the forsaken mosque
had ﬂourished and the call of God was raised within that building.

In short, as result of the opening of the mosque, traffic in the
> Shimshírgarhá Street increased considerably. Gradually, the visits of
> Baháʾís to the House of the Báb became a topic of constant discussion
> not only at this mosque but also in Sháh-Chiráq, Masjid Vakíl, and other
> locations. Of course the ﬂow of Baháʾí pilgrims, particularly during such
> sacred seasons as Ridván or Naw-Rúz, even when undertaken with great
> wisdom, drew great notice in the neighborhood and provoked much
> hostility. Siyyid Núriʾd-Dín interpreted continual visits to the House of
> the Báb as an eﬀort to undermine his own authority and, therefore, set
> out to incite the people of Shíráz and other towns against the Baháʾís.
> In particular, the friends in Sarvistán, Nayríz, Jahrum, and Ábádih were
placed under great pressures during this period.

The reopening of the mosque and the increased focus on the House of
> the Báb multiplied my father’s worries by many fold. Led by Ridázádih,
> a son-in-law of Siyyid Núriʾd-Dín, most nights the crowds of so-called
> worshipers would pass through the street and loudly protest under various
> pretexts. These comings and goings were particularly intensiﬁed during
> the months of Muharram, Safar, Shaʿbán, and Ramadán, as well as on all
> occasions associated with the Prophet Muhammad and the Holy Imáms.
> On these nights, whatever the weather, my father would go onto the
> roof of the house adjacent to the Blessed House, overlooking the street.
> He would sit guarding the perimeter, peering through holes of the fence,
> watching their activities until the last person had left the mosque and the
door was locked. Only then would he consider it safe to come inside.

Another incident that took place in the year 1326 Sh [1947] was the
> following: One day Brigadier General Qavámí, the Furúghuʾl-Mulk, who
> was the police commissioner and a close friend of my father, informed
> him, “It has come to my attention that Siyyid Núriʾd-Dín and his follow-
> ers are [secretly] planning to commit arson at the House of the Báb. Of
> course, I will assign security oﬃcers to patrol Shimshírgarhá Street round
> the clock, but for a while you must observe the utmost wisdom in your
dealings lest troubles be created.”

That very afternoon, multitudes of our adversaries began to frequent
the [Shamshírgarhá] Street. They carried with them such provisions as

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 249                                                                 7/10/2008 2:44:14 PM

> straw, kerosene, gasoline, and gunpowder, and stockpiled them inside
> the mosque. Deeply perturbed over the fate that awaited the Blessed
> House, my father secluded himself in the upper chamber of the House
> and unceasingly would chant [Baháʾuʾlláh’s] Salát Hájjat,381 [the Báb’s]
Duʿá Tavassul, and other protection prayers.

On the same street lived a policeman who was very close to Siyyid
> Núriʾd-Dín and who was related to the custodian of the mosque as well.
> At times he would visit my father and would boast about the plans and
> the popularity of the Siyyid. That day it so happened that about one hour
> before dusk he came for one of these occasional visits. In addition, by
> chance, Ustád Áqá Ján Muqanní [the well-digger] and several of his crew
> were present concluding some business account. Moreover, a few Baháʾí
> youth from Sarvistán were also there for the purpose of pilgrimage to the
> House of the Báb, and all had gathered in the courtyard. Resting against
> the wall was my father’s hunting gun and some boxes of bullets. When
> the policeman came inside, my father called to him and with the utmost
> severity said to him, “Go and tell that frivolous Siyyid that if he or others
> are foolish enough to step into this street this night, his life will be in
> great peril. These men and another ﬁfty armed Baháʾís, who are waiting
> nearby, are determined to protect this House with their very lives. Should
> the crazed Siyyid take one step into this neighborhood, then blood will
> be spilled, and his will be the ﬁrst. Tonight is the night that we intend
> revenge for all the harm that you people have perpetrated and a lifetime
> of transgression that we have endured. He should be advised not to act
in such a way as would cause a great bloodbath on this very street.”

Having never heard my father speak in such vehement fashion, the
> guardsman withdrew in haste and proceeded directly to inform the
> Siyyid of my father’s message. He had not only added much of his own
> embellishments but also reported that he had witnessed a number of
> eager Baháʾís arrayed for this purpose, with guns and munitions at their
> side. These exaggerated reports served to frighten the Siyyid who at once
> instructed his followers to cancel their plans and not to be seen in our
> district. Further, that very night he sent several of his men to remove the
> provisions for arson from the mosque. No incident took place that night,
> and for quite some time the Siyyid and his men posed no threat to the

The day after this event, the Furúghuʾl-Mulk telephoned my father and
> in the course of expressing his elation for the way that aﬀairs had unfolded,
> remarked, “I am puzzled as to what caused the Siyyid to change his mind
> and not attack your House.” My father made reply, “The Siyyid’s goal
> is to serve himself; however, mine is to serve God. Consequently, with
> every breath I am guided, while he is left to his own devices. The divine
> conﬁrmations can reduce mountains and still every storm. But in fact, it
> is not we who are guided, rather we are unworthy instruments for His
> all-encompassing Will.”

The Passing of Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh Afnán

> Near the end of his life, my father developed acute asthma, coupled with
> a heart problem, and consequently needed to rest more often. However,
> not once did he fall short in his duties and responsibilities as the custo-
> dian of the Blessed House and continued unabated to serve as before,
> and he was always present at the meetings of the Spiritual Assembly and
> other gatherings. Every day before dawn, he would be ready to welcome
> and receive the pilgrims to the sacred threshold of the House of the Báb,
> and he would exert much care ensuring that each visitor had a most
> spiritual and uplifting experience and thoroughly appreciated this divine
> benediction. For each group that visited, with greatest care and reverence
> he would prepare the Sacred Writings and Holy Relics associated with
> such visits, and afterwards would gather them with his own hands and
> place them in their special container. His insistence on continuing with
> the daily routines as before severely worsened his condition and ﬁnally
placed him at death’s door.

In short, after several heart attacks, in the month of Mihr of the
> year 1330 Sh [September 1951] he was bedridden. His physician, Dr.
> Muʿtamid, a most competent man who had been trained in Paris and who
> specialized in heart conditions, was able to make him more comfortable
> during his last days. My father ﬁnally passed from this nether world for
> the eternal abode on 30 Ázar 1330 Sh [22 December 1951] at the age
> of seventy-four. The telegram of the beloved Guardian on this occasion
> was our sole consolation and greatly calmed the heart and soul of every
> member of his family.

APPENDIX TWO

BAHÁʾÍ HISTORICAL PLACES IN SHÍRÁZ382

1. The House of the Báb

> In the Writings of the Báb, His Blessed House has been given unique
> and everlasting favors. Such blessings are found in: the Qayyumuʾl-Asmaʾ,
> chapter Rukn (pillar), 35–38; the Persian Bayán 4:16–18; the Arabic Bayán
> 4:16–19; Tablet to Khál Akbar at the time of the Báb’s departure from
> Shíráz for Isfahán (generally understood to be His Will and Testament);
and the Kitáb Panj Shaʾn, chapter 1.

In time, it is expected that the House of the Báb will have certain
> dependencies. These are called for in the following Tablet of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá
to the Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʾís of Shíráz:

> To the members of the Spiritual Assembly, upon them rest the Glory of
God, the Most Glorious.

> O servants of the Abhá Beauty! Your missive arrived, and its contents were
> made manifest. Similarly, your letter to the illustrious Afnán of the Lote-
> Tree, upon him rest the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, was received, as
> well as his response to your Assembly, which were most carefully perused,
and I regret the delay in responding.

Through the conﬁrmations of the Ancient Beauty, may My spirit be a
> sacriﬁce unto His friends, the Sacred House has been rescued from ruins
> and, through all available means, was rebuilt in the manner of former times.
> Through the assistance of the Greatest Name, various dependencies of that
> Mighty House, such as a hospital, an orphanage, a home for the elderly,
> and others will be constructed and completed in time. . . .383

> During the early part of this century [the twentieth century], the resi-
> dence next to the House of the Báb was also purchased and made part
> of the Blessed House. Three of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s Tablets providing detailed

For the most part, this appendix is a translation of excerpts of Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán’s
> article, “Baytuʾlláh Akram.” An outline of the same history is given in Fayzí, Khándán
Afnán, pp. 204–14.

> instructions in this regard are most noteworthy and should be mentioned
at this juncture:

He is the Most Glorious.

> O ye illustrious Afnán! A few months ago, a prayer was revealed beseeching
> protection and divine favors for all the Afnán of the sanctiﬁed Tree and
> praising the qualities of the oﬀshoots of the sacred Tree, but news of its
> arrival hath not been received. Nor hath there been any news of receipt of
> one thousand tumáns sent for the purchase of the adjacent home. Inform
> on what ye have done regarding that house and how much hath been
> received through [Hájí] Amín. But do so urgently. If you do not have time
> to write, then ask someone else to report on your behalf. It hath been a
> while since any news or communication from the Afnán of Shíráz hath
been received.

I am encompassed by assaulting multitudes of mischief, diﬃculties, and
> calumnies, and because I must write to the whole world, not a moment is
> left to me. Notwithstanding, I write in my own hand that ye may realize
> how profoundly I care about this important undertaking. The object is, God
> willing, that the house adjacent to that Sanctiﬁed Court will be purchased,
> that none might be permitted to verbally or physically become presumptu-
> ous towards it. This house will be like a fortiﬁed foundation and a secure
and permanent perimeter.

Through the protection and favors of the Blessed Beauty, we remain
> steadfast and determined, and beseech mighty conﬁrmations and great
> blessings for the illustrious Afnán of the sacred Lote-Tree. Upon them all
rest the Glory of God, the Most Glorious.

ʿAbduʾl-Bahá ʿAbbás.384

> The second Tablet of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá about the purchase of the adjacent
house follows:

He is the Most Glorious.

> O ﬁrm oﬀshoots of the sacred Lote-Tree! Your latest letter indicated that the
> promised house was purchased on 22 Ramadán [9 June 1920] for twenty-six
> hundred tumáns cash and a one hundred and seventy-ﬁve tumáns mort-
> gage. That is, for a total of twenty-seven hundred and seventy-ﬁve tumáns.
> Through whatever means possible, God willing, the ﬁnal seven hundred and
> seventy-ﬁve tumáns will be raised and forwarded to you. Prepare an exact
ﬁnancial ledger of this transaction so that records may be kept.

Regarding the property title: twice we purchased the House of Baghdad,
> and yet have lost it in both instances. Once it was purchased in the name
> of Áqá Siyyid Ahmad and another time by Hájí Husayn, and every time,
> after their passing, the House was lost to us. Therefore, you must act in
> such wise that no diﬃculty would be encountered in the future.

26 Dhiʾl-Hajjih 1339 AH [10 September 1920], Haifa, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá
ʿAbbás.385
The third Tablet of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá states:

> Shíráz. The illustrious Afnán of the sacred Lote-Tree, the honored Áqá Mírzá
Buzurg, upon him rest the Glory of God.

He is the Most Glorious.

> O thou oﬀshoot of the divine Lote-Tree! Thy letter dated 20 Muharram AH
> 1339 [4 October 1920] was received, and its contents caused the utmost
> joy and felicity on account of the news of the prescribed House. Praised be
> God that eﬀorts were exerted and that house became part of the estate of
> the Blessed House [of the Báb]. In these days, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s joy concerns
> things as pertain to the Exalted One, the Primal Point, may my spirit be
> sacriﬁced for Him, or to the blessed Threshold of Baháʾuʾlláh, may my spirit
be a sacriﬁce for His servants.

Glorify thy God and thank Him for having favored thee with such bounty
> and allowed thee to render such service! Two thousand tumáns were sent
> through the honored Amín, and praised be God it hath arrived. Through
> the divine benevolence, I cherish the hope that thou wilt be rendered suc-
> cessful in all thine undertakings. The account that thou didst send was
clear and accurate.

2. Birthplace of the Báb

> This house was situated between the residences of Hájí Mírzá Siyyid
> Muhammad, known as the Khál Akbar, and that of Hájí Mírzá Siyyid
> ʿAlí, surnamed the Khál Aʿzam. The illustrious Báb was born in the upper
> chamber of the house, a room situated in the northwestern corner of the
building.387

In the original design, the western ﬂank of the house consisted of the
> main entrance, which opened onto the street behind the house; three
> rooms and two corridors on the lower ﬂoor; and two rooms on the second
> ﬂoor. The central room on the lower ﬂoor was called “ursí ” and had ﬁve
> doors and a ceiling as high as the entire building. This room was situated

Three years after the Báb, Khadíjih Bagum was also born in this house.

> in the center of the building, and two rather large corridors connected
> to either side of it. In addition, another room opened onto each of the
> corridors and had an entrance on the opposite side as well. At the end of
> each corridor, two spiral staircases connected the lower ﬂoor to the upper
> one and opened onto what was known as two-Gúshvarih [shape of two
> symmetrical earrings]. The rooms on the upper ﬂoor were situated over
the chambers below.

Originally, this house was a property of Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí<3>, the son
> of Áqá Mírzá ʿAbid. With his passing, it came into the possession of his
> four children, each having an equal share. When the business activities of
> the older son of Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí (namely, Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim<11>)
> ﬂourished, he bought a few contiguous, smaller buildings situated in the
> Maydán Sháh quarter of Shíráz. He decided to demolish these and build
> a new, much larger, luxurious home in their place and to move his fam-
> ily there from the Bazaar Murgh quarter. His brother, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid
> Hasan<10>, was a young man and moved to Yazd at about that time.
> He had no interest in his inherited share of the ancestral home. Zahrá
> Bagum, the older daughter of Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí, lived with her husband,
> Áqá Mírzá Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín. Moreover, the youngest child, Khadíjih
> Bagum, the wife of the Báb, resided in the Blessed House. Therefore,
> this left vacant the house where the Báb was born, and, as such, it was
> leased to Hájí Muhammad Mihdí Hijjáb, the maternal half-brother of
these four siblings.

Hájí Hijjáb died in AH 1304 [1887]. As a favor to his nephews, Hájí
> Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim left this house to the children of the deceased. A year
> later, Hájí Mírzá himself passed away and was soon followed by two of
> his sons. His second oldest son, Áqá Mírzá Abuʾl-Hasan<38>, left Shíráz
> for ʿIshqábád and Samarqand, where he spent most of his life, and even-
> tually went to Haifa where he passed away in 1921. As such, the only
> legal and rightful heir of this house was Áqá Siyyid Muhammad-Husayn
> Afnán<37>, but he was unable to counter the claims of Hijjáb’s family
and lost his claim to the property.

Eventually, these occupants sold the house to a carpet-seller who was
> among the most determined enemies of the Baháʾí Faith.388 His occupancy
> of the house, so close to the houses of the two uncles, caused many dif-
> ﬁculties. Ultimately, the municipality demolished the eastern section of

See appendix 1, which outlines Hasan Balyúzí’s visit to Shíráz and gives an example
of this carpet-seller’s sedition.

> this house because it was in the path of Sháh-Chiráq Street. At that time,
> the Spiritual Assembly tried hard to buy the house, but even then, out
> of spite for the Baháʾí Faith, the owner did not agree to sell. He donated
> it to the Mihdiyyih and placed a sign [of the Mihdiyyih] on the house.
> Finally, during the expansion of the Sháh-Chiráq Circle, the entire build-
> ing was demolished.

3. House of the Khál Aʿzam

> ʿAbduʾl-Bahá named this house a Mashriquʾl-Adhkár. It ranks among the
> most sacred Baháʾí places in Shíráz, claiming a singular spiritual station.
> After the passing of His father, the Báb moved His residence to this house,
> where He lived until the age of ﬁfteen. After His return from Mecca, He
> was subjected to harm and torment by the Sáhib-Ikhtíyár, the governor
> of Fárs, and to subsequent imprisonment. He was freed only after the
> Imám-Jumʿih intervened and the Khál Aʿzam oﬀered a surety. Further,
> it was agreed that the Báb would stay in the house of the Khál and not
> associate with those who sought His audience. These sanctions proved
> eﬀective, and with the passage of time, a measure of tranquility was realized.
> Eventually, favorable conditions allowed for regular meetings between the
> Báb and His followers in this very house. It was here that such disciples as
> Mullá Husayn, Siyyid Husayn Yazdí, Mullá ʿAbduʾl-Karím Qazvíní, Mullá
> Shaykh ʿAlí ʿAzím, and other learned Bábís such as Siyyid Javád Karbaláʾí
> were admitted to the sanctiﬁed presence of the Báb. It was also here that
> the celebrated Vahíd Dárábí attained the Báb’s luminous audience and the
> Commentary on the Surih of Kawthar revealed for him, enabling him to
drink his ﬁll from the chalice of certitude.

After the Báb’s mother departed for Karbalá, Khadíjih Bagum left the
> House of the Báb and took up residence here. She stayed for many years
> and was able to welcome and entertain such honored guests as Munírih
> Khánum [ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s future wife]. After the martyrdom of the Khál
> Aʿzam, this house was left in the custody of his wife [Hájíyyih Bíbí Ján-
> Ján] and his son, Mírzá Javád<23>. After them, two-thirds of the property
> was claimed by non-Baháʾí heirs, who decided to sell their portion in AH
> 1327 [1909]. Áqá Siyyid Muhammad-Husayn Afnán<37> communicated
> this news to the Holy Land. Consequently, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá instructed the
> Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih<99> to purchase these shares in the name of the
> Baháʾí community. He carried out the Master’s instructions through Hájí
> ʿAbduʾr-Rahmán Kumpání, and the house came into the Baháʾí Faith’s

> possession. In a Tablet addressed to Áqá Siyyid Muhammad-Husayn Afnán,
the beloved ʿAbduʾl-Bahá states:

> Thou hadst written regarding the house that was the dwelling of the illustri-
> ous branch of the sacred Tree, the martyred uncle, Áqá Siyyid ʿAlí—may
> My spirit be a sacriﬁce unto him. That house was the residence of the
> Holy Dove and situated next to the House of the luminary of the Supreme
> Concourse, the Primal Point—may My spirit, My essence, and My whole
> being be a sacriﬁce unto Him. Therefore, that house is considered among
the Holy Places, deserving utmost attention and consideration.

Convey My warmest greetings to the honored celestial twig, Mírzá ʿAlí-
> Muhammad Khán [the Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih] and inform him on my behalf,
> “O wondrous branch! With utmost attention and determination, exert thyself
> in securing that sacred house from the hands of the nonbelievers and turn it
> into a Mashriquʾl-Adhkár. However, if this would incite uproar among the
> rabble, then it is suﬃcient to have the sacred house in our possession and to
> quietly organize meetings where the friends, in the morning and at dusk, can
> oﬀer prayers and meditations. Through the blessing of this magniﬁcent deed,
> the hearts will turn to the Merciful Lord, exultation will be raised, rapture
> will surround all, the ﬁre of God’s love will glow brilliantly, and unsurpassed
> excitement will envelop the friends. In other lands, the Mashriquʾl-Adhkár
> hath precipitated outpourings of divine favors, caused the hearts to overﬂow
> with immense joy and felicity, and hath bestowed divine radiance on all
> souls. In Shíráz, however, utmost wisdom and prudence must be observed
> so that nonbelievers may not become informed. Even among the friends it
> should be called a spiritual gathering. Otherwise, the unworthy will plot
> sedition [to destroy it] and provoke fear in the hearts. . . .”
> After a while, the house became the gathering point of the teachers and
> promoters of the Baháʾí Faith, and general meetings, Holy Day celebra-
> tions, deepening classes, and institutes were held there. Moreover, it
> sheltered the friends who visited from other cities. As such, this house
> became known as the center of the Baháʾí activities of Shíráz and attracted
the attention of foes.

In 1324 Sh [1945], the Shíráz municipality ordered that Lutf-ʿAlí Khán
> Zand Street be extended to the vicinity of Sháh-Chiráq. In the process,
> they had to demolish all the buildings in their path. This house was one
> of those properties, and four-ﬁfths of it was demolished during the road-
> work. However, at that time, the remaining one-ﬁfth of the house was
> left untouched. This consisted of the western section, which included the
> room where the Letters of the Living would gather, the sleeping quarters
> of the Khál, and the storage room next to it. Also, the lower ﬂoor and the
> tunnel that led from the house of the uncle to the house of Áqá Mírzá
> ʿAlí—that is, the house where the Báb was born and reared—remained

> standing. On the instructions of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʾís of
> Shíráz, a wall was constructed in front of this remaining section and a
custodian appointed to look after it.

In 1348 Sh [1969], the rest of the house—mentioned in the Báb’s Will
> and Testament—and the house of the Khál Akbar were demolished at the
> instigation of Sharíﬃ, the custodian of Sháh-Chiráq, with the approval of
> the Sháh. The land was added to the Sháh-Chiráq Circle.

4. The oﬃce of the uncle of the Báb in the Saráy Gumrukí has remained

> to the present day and stands in the same form and shape as it did
> during his time.
5. The house of Mírzá Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín is currently in the hands of non-

Baháʾís, though it has been preserved unchanged.
6. Bazaar Vakíl, Masjid Vakíl, and the stone pulpit ascended by the Báb

have all endured to the present day.
7. ʿImárat Khurshíd, where Husayn Khán interrogated the Báb, was

destroyed in the process of building Zand Avenue.
8. Kázirun Gate has changed. The section that stood at the time of the Báb

has now become part of the street and is surrounded by other buildings.
9. The school attended by the Báb was in Qahviyih Awlíyá. It has changed

considerably and is not used very often.
10. Hammam Bazaar Murgh, used by the family of the Báb and His

Holiness, no longer exists.

Biographical Notes on the Governors since 1844

> Mírzá Ahmad Khán, the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih
> Born in 1866 as the second son of Muhammad-Rahím Khán, the Amír-
> Nizám, he commenced his service in the royal court at the age of sixteen.
> Four years later he had already reached the rank of Amír-Tumán (lieu-
> tenant-general) and in 1897 was ﬁrst appointed governor of Zanján and
> later in 1903 was given the same post in Fárs. Wherever he ruled, he left
> his mark as a brutal and vulgar man, known particularly for his obscene
> expressions. He became the governor of Tihrán in 1905 and soon was at
> odds with the monarch, who imprisoned him and his brother. Released
> from prison, he was caught up in the fervor of the Constitutional Revolt,
> which ﬁrst saw his home ﬁrebombed and at a later date, 1 December
> 1911, him fallen to the assassin’s bullet.

> Bahrám Mírzá, the Muʿizzuʾd-Dawlih
> The second son of ʿAbbás Mírzá, the Náyíbu’s-Saltanih, he was appointed
> governor of Kirmánsháh, Luristán, and Khúzistán in 1834. After two years,
> he was appointed governor of Qazvín, and in 1848 he gained the same
> post in Fárs, a post he held for a little more than two years. Subsequently,
> he returned to Tihrán and was given various posts until in 1858 when
> he was sent to Tabriz where he ruled for the next two years as governor.

Deposed 5 October 1876.

the governors of fárs                          265

> In 1865, he was placed in charge of the army’s internal aﬀairs, and three
> years later became the governor of Luristán, a post he alternately held with
> his brother, Hamzih Mírzá, until he died on 21 October 1882.

> Farhád Mírzá, the Muʿtamiduʾd-Dawlih
> The ﬁfteenth son of ʿAbbás Mírzá, the Náyíbu’s-Saltanih, he was born in
> April 1818. At the age of 17, his brother, Bahrám Mírzá, appointed him
> governor of Luristán. In the next several years, whenever Muhammad Sháh
> would leave the capital, Farhád Mírzá would be placed in charge of the
> city’s security and the protection of the throne. In September 1841 he
> was appointed the governor of Fárs, a post that he held for about three
> years, but he remained in Shíráz until 1855 in various senior positions. It
> is unclear why he broke rank with Násiriʾd-Dín Sháh; however, for some
> period of time between 1855 and 1862 he lived in the British Embassy
> of Tihrán under political asylum. Eventually, in 1862 he was pardoned,
> granted the title of the Muʿtamiduʾd-Dawlih, and sent oﬀ as governor of
> Luristán and Khúzistán, a post he held for two years. In 1866 he became
> governor of Kurdistán, where he remained for the next six years. During the
> monarch’s sojourn in Europe, this uncle of the Sháh was brought to Tihrán
> to assist once more with the protection of the throne in his absence. In
> spring 1876, he was appointed governor of Fárs for a second tour of duty.
> Overall, he was a vicious ruler who often boasted that he had killed more
> than 600 men and severed the hands of 700 more. His only concern was
> to amass wealth, and this he achieved at the expense of poverty-stricken
> peasants. He spent portions of his lavish estate on the construction of
> shrines in the ʿAtabát. Several books by him have remained.

> Fírúz Mírzá, the Nusratuʾd-Dawlih
> Born in 1817 as the sixteenth son of ʿAbbás Mírzá, the Náyíbu’s-Saltanih,
> he was sent by his older brother, Muhammad Sháh, to govern Fárs in
> February 1835 in the company of Manuchihr Khán, the Muʿtamiduʾd-
> Dawlih, and the British oﬃcer Sir Henry Lindsay Bethune. He gained his
> rule in Fárs after reducing the insurgents in the vicinity of Shíráz. Nearly
> two years later, he was sent to Kirmán to deal with the revolt in that region
> and was made governor of the province. In the spring of 1850, for the
> second time, he was appointed governor of Fárs, which tenure lasted some
> three years. Until 1867, he held various senior posts in Tabríz, Arák, and
> Tihrán, and in that year he was given the governorship of Khurásán—a
> post that he would hold sporadically for the next four years. In 1874 he

> and in 1880 was appointed governor of Kirmán for two years. He died

> Ghulám-Husayn Ghaﬀarí, the Sáhib-Ikhtíyár
> A son of Mírzá Háshím Khán, the Amínuʾd-Dawlih, he was born in 1859,
> and starting in 1882 he was given various posts within the court, mostly
> ceremonial assignments. From 1900 to 1903, he served as the justice
> minister. At the beginning of the Constitutional Revolt, that is, in 1907,
> he was given the title of the Sáhib-Ikhtíyár395 and was sent as governor
> to Fárs, where he ruled for only three months. A few months later, he
> was given the same post, but again it lasted for only a short time. In the
> latter years of his life, he served in various posts in the cabinet and died
> on 29 March 1947.

> Ghulám-Ridá Khán, the Ásifuʾd-Dawlih
> Like his father, Husayn Khán, the Nizámuʾd-Dawlih, he was a high-rank-
> ing oﬃcer. Ghulám-Ridá Khán entered military service and by 1883 had
> been elevated to general and appointed commander of the artillery forces.
> In the same year he was given the governorship of Mázandarán. Five years
> later he was again given the same post and in 1891 was sent as governor
> to Khúzistán. In summer of 1897, he was appointed governor of Kirmán,
> a post he held for two years. Afterwards, he gained various ministry posts
> in Tihrán. In 1907 he became Governor of Khurásán and in response to
> a popular uprising against him ordered a massive massacre. In 1908 he
> was given the governorship of Fárs, and under his watch the uprising of
> Lár and the pogrom of the Baháʾís of Nayríz took place.

> Husayn Khán, the Nizámuʾd-Dawlih
> A native of Marghih, Husayn Khán, or more accurately, Muhammad-
> Husayn Khán Muqaddam, was a decorated military commander who
> showed great bravery during the Perso-Russian wars of 1826–28 and was

This title was ﬁrst used by Nádir Sháh who bestowed it upon Mírzá Muhammad-
> Husayn, the custodian of Sháh-Chiráq of Shíráz. When the Sháh arrived in Kirmán in
> 1651, he summoned all the ministers of Fárs and ordered some killed and the rest blinded.
> In that same year, he appointed Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn governor of Fárs and titled
> him Sáhib-Ikhtíyár, authorized to kill, on any single occasion up to 50 men, but allowed
> to blind or maim as many as he wished.

> elevated to the rank of the Ájúdán-Báshí (adjutant-major), and eventu-
> ally became a full general. In the late 1830s he was sent as the Iranian
> ambassador to Istanbul and thence to Paris, and represented the Qájár
> throne during the coronation of Queen Victoria in England. He returned
> to Tihrán in December 1839 and was given the title of the Nizámuʾd-
> Dawlih and assigned the governorship of Yazd. In 1844, he was appointed
> governor-general of Fárs, with the added title of Sáhib-Ikhtíyár, a post he
> held until 1848 when because of personal animosity between him and
> Mírzá Taqí Khán, the prime minister, he was dismissed from oﬃce after a
> massive upheaval in the city of Shíráz that resulted in many deaths. Even
> though he will forever be remembered as the ﬁrst oﬃcial who opposed
> and mistreated the Báb, nonetheless, fairness dictates that it be pointed
> out Husayn Khán ranked among the ablest administrators of his age.
> Wherever he ruled as a minister, he exerted eﬀorts to better the condition
> of his people. He died in the year 1865.

> Husayn-Qulí Khán, the Nizámu’s-Saltanih
> Among the most accomplished of the Qájár rulers and known for his
> knowledge, wisdom, and abilities, he was born in 1832 to the family of
> Sharrif Khán Qazvíní. During the early phase of his career, he was an aid
> to the Hisámu’s-Saltanih and accompanied him to various posts. His ﬁrst
> major assignment came in 1871 when he was appointed deputy-gover-
> nor of Isfahán. Three years later, he was given the governorship of Yazd,
> a post he administered for a year. He then came to Tihrán and stayed
> until 1882 while he made a fortune through the commodities market. In
> 1886, he became the governor of Zanján and two years later was given
> the province of Khúzistán to govern. In 1893 the Prince Nusratuʾd-Din
> Mírzá was installed as the governor of Fárs, and Husayn-Qulí Khán was
> sent in eﬀect to administer the province. During this tenure, he was able
> to eﬀectively curtail the power of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk II, but after one and
> a half years was sent back to Khúzistán. He came to Tihrán in 1897 and
> was given the treasury ministry, and after a year he was sent to Tabríz as
> its governor. He was given the governorship of Fárs for yet another short
> period, but on 21 December 1907 he was elevated to prime minister, only
> to resign a few months later. He died shortly thereafter in 1908 in Tihrán.

He has left a vivid autobiography, which remains unpublished.

> Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán, the Sahámuʾd-Dawlih
> A son of Hájí Qanbar Khán, the Saʿduʾd-Dawlih, he was the chief of
> guards for Kamrán Mírzá and in 1895 was elevated to the rank of Amír-
> Tumání (major general). Nine years later he was given his title and in
> 1909 became the governor of Fárs and proved a capable administrator.
> In the course of various appointments, he amassed a huge fortune that
> for several generations has beneﬁted his descendants.

> Malik-Mansúr Mírzá, the Shuʿáʿu’s-Saltanih
> The second son of Muzaﬀariʾd-Dín Sháh, he was twice appointed governor
> of Fárs, but each time he was ousted from oﬃce as a result of popular
> rebellions against him. In each of these incidents, even though he had
> amassed one of the largest fortunes in the country, he would still try to
> extort properties from the powerful Qavám clan of Fárs—a goal that
> remained largely unrealized. Through the eﬀorts of the ʿAynuʾd-Dawlih and
> with British consent, he also cherished ambitions to the throne, which goal
> likewise remained unfulﬁlled. A sizeable portion of his personal fortune
> was lost during the Constitutional Revolt, and toward the end of his life
> he lived in Tihrán. Malik-Mansúr Mírzá had a potential for greatness that
> remained unrealized. When he was ﬁrst appointed governor of Fárs, in a
> Tablet of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá the following was revealed in honor of Áqá Mírzá
Áqá Núriʾd-Dín in Shíráz:

> . . . Your letter of 22 Safar AH 1319 [10 June 1901] was received, and its
> contents closely considered. You had written about the equity and justice
> of the victorious ruler, and this brought joy and felicity to our hearts. Of a
> certainty, he will be the recipient of divine conﬁrmations and favors, and the
> news of his generous justice will endure for generations and ages. I beseech
> God to aid him by the invisible host and to enable him to beﬁttingly serve
> His Majesty the King. Thanks must be rendered for this equity, and such
> justice must be embraced and upheld faithfully. Therefore, all the friends
> must readily serve and obey, much like sheep following the command of
> their shepherd. They must deal with matters in the utmost patience and
> steadfastness.396

APPENDIX FOUR

CONVERSION OF THE GREAT UNCLE OF THE BÁB

> Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad, the eldest of the maternal uncles of the
> Báb and the recipient of the Kitáb-i Íqán, was born in 1798 and is com-
> monly referred to as the Khál Akbar [the great uncle]. He was the ﬁrst-
> born of Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn, son of Áqá Mírzá ʿAbid (known
> as Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín),399 son of Áqá Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad. This family
> ranked among the best-known and most trustworthy merchants in the
> Province of Fárs. His wife, Hájíyyih Bíbí Fátimih-Sáhib, was a daughter of
> Hájí Muhammad-Muhsin and a member of another prominent merchant
> family of ʿAbduʾl-Husayní, trading in Shíráz and Búshihr, and eventually
having commercial interests that extended from India to Europe.400

Khál Akbar ran the family oﬃce in Búshihr, and consequently the Báb
> was closely associated with him during the ﬁrst four years He worked as
> a merchant there. During this period, Khál Akbar was concerned that
> the Báb’s preoccupation with religious matters would create problems and
> had remained skeptical of such proclivities. Later in the summer of 1844
> the Báb instructed Mullá ʿAlí Bastámí—the second to believe in Him—to
> journey to Búshihr and to share the news of His proclamation with Hájí
> Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad. It appears that in the course of this visit, the
uncle grew considerably in his understanding of the Báb’s claim.

A few months later, on His pilgrimage journey, the Báb stayed with the
> same uncle and once more, on 15 May 1845, visited him for ten days on
> His return as He passed through Búshihr.401 It seems that by this time,
> the uncle had developed a deep sense of respect and devotion towards
> the saintly character and even the claim of his Nephew and warmly wel-
> comed Him. It was during this visit of the Báb that the following letter
> was sent by the Khál Akbar to his own mother and sister—respectively,
> the grandmother and the mother of the Báb. The original of this letter in

> From the above letter, it is quite clear that the uncle believed in the Cause

> Therefore, it seems reasonable to surmise that by this stage at least some

ognized Him as the author of a “Cause.”

About the same time that the above letter was penned, the uncle of
> the Báb sent another dispatch to his second brother, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid
> ʿAlí<7>, known as Khál Aʿzam (the most-great uncle).405 From the content
> of this communication, it is quite evident that the Báb had already stirred
> a considerable commotion through His claim and that many, including
> some among His immediate family, were exerting eﬀorts to discourage
> Him from continuing to advance those claims. However, it also provides
> further evidence that the Khál Akbar was by then a devoted believer in
> the Báb. The original of this letter, in the hand of the great-uncle, is also
> kept in the private library of Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán, while a typed version
> appears in the Khándán Afnán.406 The ﬁrst part of this letter deals with
the family commercial business and is omitted in the translation.407

After the passing of the Báb’s father, the Khál Aʿzam served as his Nephew’s guardian
and reared Him until the age 15, at which time the Báb moved to Búshihr.

Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, pp. 27–31.

The attribution of this letter to the Khál Akbar has been questioned in Amanat,
> Resurrection and Renewal, p. 355, n. 127, where it is suggested that this letter was written
> by Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí. However, the original text of the letter clearly indicates that it
> was authored by the Khál Akbar; moreover, the narrative of his son, the Vakíluʾd-Dawlih,
> quoted later in this appendix, conﬁrms that indeed it was the Khál Akbar who was in
Búshihr at this time.

Presumably, a reference to Quddús whose full name was Hájí Mullá Muhammad-
ʿAlí Bárfurúshí.

> gradually these talks may be erased from people’s memory, since they fear
that because of this [claim] we too might suﬀer injury or major losses.

My view, however, is that if we were to consider the matter from the
> worldly perspective, then it is indeed as they have stated. After reading these
> missives my Master, the honored Hájí [the Báb] became greatly depressed
> over the inﬁrmity of those who had penned these [letters]. Nevertheless, He
> stated, “Regarding the teaching of the Cause, what Akhúnd Mullá Husayn
> [Bushrúʾí] initially transmitted to the King, the ʿulamá, and the people
> should have suﬃced, and this second time was only because of Our grace,
> as there was no need for it. Now that such reactions have been observed
> and will be discerned, for [the next] ﬁve years I have forbidden unto Myself
> the revelation of verses, and this indeed is the most grievous punishment
> for such as have denied, and they will comprehend its eﬀect only after they
> have been left with no recourse. After My arrival in Shíráz, as had been My
> practice in the past, I will remain in My House and will not associate with
> anyone and will not allow others to attain unto My Presence. I will have
> no dealings with anyone and will leave people to themselves. Meanwhile,
> should anyone be found who seeks the Truth and is willing to embrace it,
> then I shall designate one to answer his questions. Once I decline to associate
> with others, others will forget about Me as well. If it were not because of
> My esteemed mother, I would never return to Shíráz and single and alone
> would establish My home in this very city [i.e., Búshihr], or would go in
a direction that none would know.”

If our honored mother desires to visit the sacred city of Mashhad, she can
> proceed with you. As such, please arrange for her journey. And by then, if
> the Hájí [the Báb] was to arrive [in Shíráz], they would be together for a few
days, and she could go afterwards. Otherwise, may they journey in peace.

In short, these were the utterances of His honored Person. It is evident
> that they are based on His being downcast, though they represent His wish.
> God willing, once He has arrived in Shíráz, He would not associate with any
> other, and the same has been His practice while in this place. And should
> anyone ask of this matter, then answer it accordingly and state that He is
> the Proof, and all others must show obedience unto Him. What they do
> not understand of His laws, they must inquire from the one designated by
> Him and follow [His ordinances] as such. He Himself will not aﬃliate with
> anyone. And the reason for designating another person is that should people
> be found who in sincerity would recognize Him and seek to understand
> [His Revelation], then they can make their inquires from this designated
> person, as otherwise he will not associate with them either. For ﬁve years it
will continue as such, until He decrees what will occur.

He [i.e., the Báb] states, “We have no concern or relation with anyone,
> and you are to continue with your business as before and fear no one. If
> you dread My coming to Shíráz, then I will not come.” His command will
unfold as described above.

However, about what you had written, “These Writings are not proof,”
> and your inquiry as to how this servant attained certitude [in the Báb], I
> respond that besides these Writings, His very Person is the Proof. Consider

Verses. Is this not proof ?

Further, your own self had written, and the esteemed Hájí ʿAbduʾl-Husayn
> wrote the same, that through ascetic practices, He [i.e., the Báb] has attained
> spiritual perfection. Should One be the recipient of divine favors and be
> blessed to receive such [heavenly] grace, then surely God will protect Him
> from satanic desires. His honored Person [i.e., the Báb] has written in many
> places, “If anyone is certain in his own ways and denies My Cause, then let
> him come forth and engage Me in mubahilih.”409 I take refuge with God!
> How could One Who is so self-assured, be not of the truth? If you claim
> that He suﬀers from mental disturbance, I do not share your assessment, as
> how could it be that a person is unlettered while he is sane, but then when
he is mentally disturbed he becomes so erudite?

In short, that which must have been said has been repeatedly stated. You
> know best how to act. Convey my greetings to our mother and sister, and
> kindly tell them of my condition. For me, no doubt remains. I have no
> reason [to deny the Báb], as consciously I see and perceive that this Cause
> is true. What they [i.e., mother and sister] wish to believe is up to them.
> Further, they should be aware that when the honored Hájí [the Báb] arrives
> at the city [of Shíráz], He would dismount and walk to the House. Therefore,
> it is best not to inform the people, that He may be left to Himself. Until
> now, it had been incumbent upon Him to obey their410 wishes; but now it
> is the opposite, and they must strive to obey His every command. Under
no circumstances, should they disobey Him.

I have no other matter to present you. I have written a letter for Hájí
> ʿAbduʾl-Husayn that you will also see, and perchance some things said here
> will be repeated there as well. He requested the appearance of some extraor-
> dinary event [from the Báb], such as news from the beyond. Sanctiﬁed be
> God! Repeatedly, we have beheld that He would take two small coins in
> His hand and inform us of the great beyond, and of the cherubs and angels.
> But if one’s heart has not attained certitude through knowledge, then of
> what use is conveying such stories?

> From the above text, it is evident that the Báb was deeply aﬀected by the
> lukewarm reception to His Call and had initially vowed to remain silent
> for ﬁve years and cease revealing Verses, though later in Shíráz He reversed
> this decision and continued to reveal many treatises, prayers, homilies, and
> books. Further, it can readily be surmised that the Khál Akbar counted
> himself among the Báb’s followers and was urging his younger brother,
> Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, also to embrace the new Message. It seems very

Mubahilih is the practice of opponents challenging one another to mutual cursing,

but the latter failed to come.

> to accept Quddús and his representations, and enabled him to accept the
Revelation of the Báb unreservedly.411

However, we must ponder the question: At this stage, what did Khál
> Akbar understand of the Báb’s claim and station? As noted earlier, the
> uncles of the Báb were merchants and enjoyed the type of education
> and training available to the business class of their age. For schooling,
> he had attended for a few years the same school in the Masjid Naw
> that years later the Báb would attend. This meant that he was taught a
> rudimentary religious education, which consisted of reading the Qurʾán
> and a general history of Islám and its laws and basic jurisprudence. As
> a merchant, he was also taught accounting, elementary economics and,
> as any middle class citizen, was familiar with well-known collections of
> poetry and literature, particularly those of Háﬁz and Saʿdí. What he most
> certainly did not possess was the sort of rigorous seminarian education
> that the typical Bábí converts of the early days had mastered through
> devoting years of training to the acquisition of such incredibly detailed
> sciences. And further, it is not clear if this uncle had actually seen any of
> the Writings of the Báb by the time he wrote the above letters. And what
> had been revealed by that time were works such as the Qayyúmuʾl-Asmá’
> and the Commentary on the Surih of the Cow, which are ﬁlled with
> subtle and complex allusions to the Báb’s prophetic mission and which
> employ very sophisticated symbolism, in all probability, remaining beyond
> the ability of the Khál Akbar to discern their full signiﬁcance. That is,
> since his knowledge and education consisted of what was common for

Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad’s eldest son, the renowned Hájí Mírzá
> Muhammad-Taqí, titled the Vakíluʾd-Dawlih, was born in 1830 and by
> this time, 1845, had joined his father in Búshihr and was engaged in his

appeared in Khándán Afnán:412
J-2 AH 1324 [July 1906]

The honored and revered Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí-Akbar Rafsinjání, who numbers
> among the foremost teachers of the Cause, has come to ʿIshqábád accompa-
> nied by Áqá Mírzá Tarázuʾlláh Qazvíní, son of the illustrious Samandar, for

> for him what I recall of the dawning of the Manifestation of the Báb and
> those kinsmen who have joined the Cause of the Ancient Beauty and have
> been named, the Afnán. Although because of the passage of time, dimin-
> ished memory, and advanced age, not all the details are recalled, however,
in order to fulﬁll his wish, the following is noted:

What this servant remembers of the said events is that prior to His dec-
> laration, the deeds, the manner, and the company of His Holiness diﬀered
> from those of other people. In the proximity of Shíráz’s Masjid Naw, Masjid
> Fath, and the Jewish neighborhood, His exalted mother, who was an aunt of
> this servant, resided in the Blessed House on the Shamshírgarhá Street—a
> House that is now the celestial Kaʿaba of the Supreme Concourse. Her sole
> oﬀspring was that Sanctiﬁed Eﬀulgence [i.e., the Báb] Whose father, Áqá
Mírzá Muhammad-Ridá, had passed away during His childhood.

This servant was a mere child when I attained His blessed presence, and
> a little of that time is recalled though other details have been forgotten. I
> remember that on Sundays I would go into the presence of my exalted aunt.
> It was in AH 1260 [1844], but I cannot be certain which month, that one
> morning I attained the presence of the Báb. He was occupied with reveal-
> ing prayers. Melon was placed before Him, and with the tip of a knife, He
> graciously oﬀered me a piece. I ate it. He handed me a page with a prayer,
> and after I had read it, He asked, “What manner of supplication do you
> consider this?” I was familiar with the Sahiﬁh-i Sadjadiyyih, recited each day
> of week and therefore replied, “It is similar to the prayer of Sahiﬁh.”413

> I remember at that time the majority of mystics and ascetics of Shíráz were
> anticipating the nearness of the Manifestation (Zuhúr). However, He had
> appeared, but was concealed from all, except the believers and devotees from
> the Shaykhí faction who upon the passing of the late Hájí Siyyid Kázim
> had gone in search of Him. It was noised abroad that a certain Person had
> appeared claiming to be the representative of the Imám (Náyíb Imám), and
> His command forbidding the use of water-pipes was circulating among the
> populace. This servant asked Him [i.e., the Báb], “Is this true?” He made
reply, “Yes, it is indeed so, and the use of water-pipes is forbidden.”

A few days later, He departed for Mecca and left us forthwith. My late
> father was in Búshihr. In Búshihr, the Báb had decided on the conversion of
> Shaykh Hasan of the family of ʿAsfúr, the Imám-Jumʿih of that city. Shaykh
Hasan had neither accepted nor rejected His claim.414

He departed on a sailing ship and along the way would reveal verses
> and homilies. In Muscat, He gained the allegiance of that city’s Imám and
revealed homilies.

Some two months after His departure, this servant left for Búshihr as well
> and was living with my late father when, some time later, the Báb returned
> from His hajj journey. In Shíráz His news was spreading exceedingly fast,
> but in accordance with His instructions, His blessed name was not known.
> The muʾadhdhins who ranked as His believers, were instructed to change
> the adhán formula into, “I testify that ʿAlí [i.e., the Báb] is a servant of
> Baqiyyatuʾlláh, as recorded in the perspicuous Book.”415 Because of this, the
> ʿulamá had issued a fatwá condemning the Author of this command and
> had beaten and expelled from the city the prayer leaders, namely, the late
> Mullá Muhammad-Sádiq [Khurásání] and Mullá Muhammad-ʿAlí [Quddús],
> may my spirit be a sacriﬁce unto them both.

> al-Sahifat al-Sajjadiyya is the oldest prayer manual in Islamic sources and one of the
> most seminal works of Islamic spirituality of the early period. . . . Shiʿite tradition

> ‘Psalms of the Household of Muhammad’. . . . According to Shiʿite tradition, Zayn
> al-ʿAbidín collected his supplications and taught them to his children, especially [the

> maintain that the text is mutawatir; in other words, it was generally known from

This collection contains ﬁfty-four supplications in the main body of the text and the
> additional supplications make up the fourteen addenda (including the prayers for the days
of the week) and the ﬁfteen munáját or ‘whispered prayers.ʾ

Shaykh Hasan is the brother of Shaykh Husayn ʿAsfúrí, the great-grandfather of
> Vahíd Dárábí. Earlier, the Báb had made mention of Shaykh Hasan in chapter 27 of His
Qayyúmuʾl-Asmáʾ.

Nabíl Aʾzam, The Dawn-Breakers, p. 144, gives the verse of the Khasáʾil-i Sabʿih as,
> “I bear witness that He whose name is ʿAlí qabl-i Muhammad [ʿAlí before Muhammad]
> is the servant of Baqiyyatuʾlláh.”

The news of His return from Mecca reached Shíráz, and the authorities
> sent ten soldiers to arrest His Holiness. The period of His stay in Búshihr
> was ten or twelve days, and my late father and this servant would regularly
> attain unto His presence. One afternoon He said to my father, “Arrange for
> a steed, since I must journey [to Shíráz].” My father pleaded with Him to
> stay longer, but it was to no avail. My late father arranged for a mount, and
> He left. En route, from Burázján He arrived at [the village of ] Dalakí where
> the soldiers charged with His arrest passed Him by. His Holiness sent His
> servant, Mubárak, to their chief, and he was brought before the Báb. The
> Latter had told him, “Why are you going to Búshihr? State your purpose
> so that your troubles may be lessened.” He had stated their charge and was
> told, “The Person whom you seek is none other than Me.” And together
> they had left for Shíráz, and were I to tell of the events of the city, it would
require a mighty book, which is beyond the abilities of this servant.

And now I will outline the kinsmen of the Báb. There is a small Tablet
> in Yazd where the Báb has revealed, “After this Manifestation, all things
> perished, except those who were exalted.” In that same Tablet it is recorded,
> “We have accepted the kinsmen among the Letters of the Exalted,416 not
> because they were worthy in themselves, rather, because of Our love and
> aﬃnity towards them.” And the Ancient Beauty has titled the kinsmen of the
> Báb as Afnán, and at that time they included the illustrious grandmother of
> the Báb who was residing in Karbalá, together with His exalted mother. And
> His honored wife [Khadíjih Bagum] and her three distinguished bothers:
> Hájí Muhammad-Mihdí, surnamed Hijáb; Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim<11>,
> the grandfather of Áqá Siyyid Hádí<96>; Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Hasan<10>,
> the father of Mírzá Muhsin<29>; and Hájí [Siyyid Mírzá<25>], who
> were all related through marriage to the Báb, but who were also related
> through their paternal families. Also my father was alive, and his children
> included: Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí<14>; Hájí Mírzá Buzurg<15>; this
> servant [Vakíluʾd-Dawlih]<13>; and my two sisters, [Bíbí Ján Bagum<16>
> and Khadíjih-Sultán Bagum<17>]. Also among the family were my uncle,
> the late Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí<7>, who was martyred in Tihrán, and his
> son, Hájí Mírzá Javád<23>, who died at an early age. The late Hájí Mírzá
> Hasan-ʿAlí<6> was in Yazd, and his children included four sons and one
> daughter who is the mother of my children. The sister of the Báb’s wife
> [Zahrá Bagum<8>] was married to the late Mírzá Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín, and the
> late Áqá Mírzá Áqá<24> was their son. Also a couple may be included from
> the paternal family of His Holiness, such as, Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn,
> His maternal cousin, who may have some surviving children, and the other
> is the late Mírzá ʿAlí-Akbar, who was martyred in Baghdad.

> There are several important points in the above document that should
> be emphasized:

Original, “Huruf-i Vajhih,” which literally means the Letters turned to Him, or
Exalted by Him.

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 281                                                                            7/10/2008 2:44:20 PM

• Abrogation of the use of water-pipes: Within the Shiʿite system of

> jurisprudence, it is solely the mujtahid who is authorized to pronounce
> on matters of personal law, and all others must refer to such accredited
> clerics. Clearly, the Báb was not certiﬁed as a mujtahid, and therefore
> the fact that He had forbidden the use of such a commonly practiced
> habit as the water-pipe, illustrates that He was assuming the right of
> legislation. In an important way this pronouncement, which is tanta-
> mount to innovation in matters of Islamic jurisprudence, signal led the
> abrogation of the Shi’ite system of laws.
• The second point has to do with the station of the Báb and how it

> was understood by the generality of people at that time. Even though
> the claim of the Báb to the station of Manifestionhood in such early
> Writings as the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’ is explicit and is beyond dispute, yet
> as noted earlier, such statements could initially be deciphered only by
> those suﬃciently trained. In this light it is of interest to note that the
> Vakílu’d-Dawlih reports that the Báb at that time was known as the
> Representative of the Imám—which indicates that through wisdom He
> was not divulging the full implications of His station.
• As noted earlier, this narrative clearly conﬁrms that the Khál Akbar was

> in Búshihr at the time of the Báb’s return from hajj, which provides
> further support to the fact that the Khál’s second letter was written
> from that city.

Muhammad-Taqí, and a typed version was reproduced in Khándán Afnán:417

> spoke of the piety and detachment of my father and grandfather, Hájí
> Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn, and even attributed the occurrence of certain

Búshihr and Shíráz.

I dimly remember my grandfather. He had three sons: My late father; the
> late Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí<7>, the martyr; and the late Hájí Mírzá Hasan-
> ʿAlí<6>, who married in Yazd and settled there. He also had a daughter<4>
> who, after the passing of her mother—particularly frail during her ﬁnal
> years—settled in the ʿAtabát. This honored aunt, who was the mother of
> the Báb—may my spirit be a sacriﬁce unto Him—went to the ʿAtabát and
remained there until her passing.

My late father had three sons and two daughters. One was my late brother,
> Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí<14>, who was a merchant in China and who
> on his return became ill in India and passed away there. His remains were
> transferred from Bombay to Madáʾin and buried near the shrine of the
> Persian Salmán. The story of his passing and the bringing of his remains
> require a book of its own, but there is no time for it now.419 My younger
> brother<15>, the late Hájí Mírzá Buzurg, had a heart attack in Shíráz and
> passed away. My older sister passed away in Yazd, while the younger one
expired in Shíráz. My late father passed away in Shíráz.

After the dawning of the eﬀulgence of the Báb, that is, the appearance
> of the promised Qáʾim, He was sent to Tabríz, Chihríq, and Máh-Kú. The
> honored and much-loved Hájí Siyyid ʿAlí<7> decided to attain His pres-
> ence and as such left Shíráz for Yazd and then Tihrán, so that in whatever
> way possible he would be able to reach the august presence of the Exalted
> One. It was during this time, however, that the upheaval of Mázandarán
> was occurring; and wherever they found a Bábí, they would martyr him,
> and this personage was also caught in Tihrán and numbered among the
> Seven Martyrs. There were a number of well-known merchants present at
> that incident and were ready to pay a ransom to secure his release, but he
> had said, “Do not waste your money as I have come for the purpose of
martyrdom.”

On two occasions, the late Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí<14> traveled to
> China, and on the ﬁrst journey returned by way of ʿAkká, where he attained
> the presence of the Ancient Beauty and was the recipient of His inﬁnite
favors. Afterwards, he came to ʿIshqábád.

Early in my life, this servant left Shíráz for Yazd where I married and
> established my home. In the course of the ﬁfth year of my stay in Yazd,
> I left in the name of a hajj journey to the House of God [in Mecca]. My
> late brother came and joined me in this journey, and then we went to the
> ʿAtabát where we achieved the principal purpose of this journey and gained

> and went before our late father, and subsequently each returned to his own
> abode. That is, this servant returned to Yazd and continued with my trade,
> and my brothers resided in Shíráz. Upon the return of Hájí Mírzá Muham-
> mad-ʿAlí from his ﬁrst journey to China and his arrival at ʿIshqábád, this
> servant wrote him and asked that he purchase some properties in that city.
> He acquired several pieces of land, houses, and shops, and wrote and sent
> the details to the presence of the Ancient Beauty. He instructed that the
> land known as Aʿzam be designated as the site for the Mashriquʾl-Adhkár.
> During His lifetime, some of this ediﬁce was raised. After His ascension,
> repeatedly the believers in ʿIshqábád appealed to Him Whom God hath
> purposed420 to build a Mashriquʾl-Adhkár. He did not accept their petition.
> Out of divine favor and grace, He instructed this servant to leave Yazd for
> ʿIshqábád and to complete most beﬁttingly the building raised partially in
> the land known as Aʿzam. He enjoined that no expense, whether contributed
by others or myself, be spared in this undertaking.

My brother had only one child, and that was Áqá Mírzá Áqá<53> who
> currently resides in Shíráz. After the ground was broken on the Aʿzam land,
> with the permission of Áqá Mírzá Áqá, the rest of the properties purchased
> by my brother for the Temple were sold, and this totaled about 30,000
> gold coins. The remaining cost was provided either by ʿAbduʾl-Bahá or
> at His bidding by believers of various cities who contributed toward this
construction.

In the presence of the [military] governor of Transcaspia, [General D.I.]
> Subotich, and the concourse of believers, the cornerstone was laid in Rajab
> AH 1320 [October 1902] The design for this nine-sided ediﬁce was provided
> by the Master, and the entire construction was done in stone and cement.
> Much metal was used in all the pillars, the domes, and the walls. During
> these days (Rabíʿuʾth-Thani and Jamádíuʾl-Avval of AH 1324 [June–July
> 1906]), the dome made from Russian iron has been installed. I cherish the
> hope that through the conﬁrmations of the Master, the remaining detailed
work will also be completed.

The above words were written previously and now, that is, Ramadán of
> AH 1324 [November 1906], praised be God, the construction has been
> completed, and we are engaged in painting the interior of the dome. About
half has been painted and, God willing, the rest will be ﬁnished soon.

In a Tablet to Hájí Mírzá Mahmúd<45>, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s blessed will has
> decreed that after completion of the dome, in the utmost joy and tranquil-

> AH 1325 [7 November 1907] for the Holy Land. Until that time, I will
> keep the account of all expenditures, and afterwards Hájí Mírzá Mahmúd
> will record the same. On Friday the 8th, I plan to leave by way of Batum.

order to obey his wish, I pen the following brief account.

I remember that in the years twelve hundred ﬁfty-nine until [twelve

> the Manifestation (Zuhúr). [For instance] someone unknown prior to the
> year sixty had inscribed on the pulpit of the Masjid Jámiʿ that within three

that were perpetrated against him by the governor-general of Fárs.

In the year sixty, it was noised throughout Shíráz that a beloved Siyyid
> had advanced the claim to be the Representative of the [hidden] Qáʾim
(Náyíb Qáʾim). However, His blessed Name was not known.

I remember that on Sundays I would attain the presence of my illustrious
> aunt, the mother of His Holiness. During such visits I gained admittance
> unto His presence as well. One Sunday during the month of Rajab, or
> perhaps it was Shaʿbán [July–August 1844], I attained such a blessing, and
> He was sitting in the courtyard of the House. After I received permission
> to sit, I noticed that melon was being served. With the tip of a knife, He
> oﬀered me a piece. The Báb was occupied in writing certain verses and
> prayers. He showed me a page upon which a prayer for the days of the week
> was revealed, and instructed me to read it. After I had recited it, He asked,

According to A.Q. Afnán, the ﬁnancial records of that era demonstrate that the

> respondence, August 1997).

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 285                                                                              7/10/2008 2:44:20 PM

> “What manner of prayer do you perceive this to be?” I replied, “It is similar
to the Sahiﬁh-i Sadjadiyyih,” a prayer that was well known to me.

It was rumored that the Representative of the Imám (Náyíb Imám) had
> forbidden the use of water pipes. Therefore, I asked if indeed this was true.
He replied, “Yes, that is correct.”

That week, or perhaps the next, He departed for pilgrimage (hajj) to
> Mecca, and left by way of Búshihr. Two or three months later, in accordance
> with my father’s wishes who was in Búshihr, I too left for that city. While
> in Búshihr, we heard that Shíráz was ﬁlled with commotion as two disciples
> of the late Hájí Siyyid Kázim [Ráshtí] who were the Imám-Jumʿih and the
> muʾadhdhin, had added this verse to the call for prayer: “I testify that ʿAlí
> is the servant of Baqiyatuʾlláh as has been sent down from the hidden Tab-

> ruling against these two Imám-Jumʿihs, namely, the honored [Mullá Sádiq]

> esteemed personages were seized by the authorities and subjected to punish-
ment, including burning of their beards and expulsion from the city.

The oﬃcials were eager to seize the Representative of the Imám (i.e., the
> Báb). When He returned from Mecca, I was in Búshihr. Day and night I

have a good end. He responded, “Your end is good.”

During this period of stay in Búshihr, my late father related two or three

my late father and would shower him with His favors.

His condition was most diﬀerent from that of others. I do not recall His

> that turned [in this Direction].” And He also stated, “Our kinsmen have
> been reckoned among the Letters of the Exalted. But not because they were
> deserving, nay, because of Our love for them.” In the course of the next
> Manifestation, this matter was inquired of His [i.e., Baháʾuʾlláh’s] presence.
> He responded, “By ʿAfnánʾ, it is meant the kinsmen of the Primal Point,
may the spirit of all be a sacriﬁce unto Him.”

The family members at the time when the [above-mentioned] blessed

In a Tablet dated 27 Muharram AH 1306 [3 October 1888] revealed
> in honor of Áqá Mírzá ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd Shírází, Baháʾuʾlláh recounts the
visit of the uncle of the Báb:

> The Kitáb-i Íqán was revealed in ʿIraq especially for the honored Afnán, the
> illustrious Khál Akbar, upon him rest all My Glory. The details are thus:
> After he had attained the ʿAtabát and completed his pilgrimage, he arrived
> in Baghdad. The exalted Hájí Siyyid Javád, upon him be the Glory of God,
> came into Our presence and said, “Two of the uncles of the Báb, may the
> spirit of all be a sacriﬁce unto Him, currently have arrived in this city and
> soon will depart for Shíráz.” We inquired, “Hast thou spoken with them
> about this Cause?” And he responded negatively. Upon hearing this response,
> We were saddened and said unto him, “Go and convey the greetings of this
> Wronged-One to them and say further, ‘Though We have not previously
cherished meeting with others, We do desire meeting with you.ʾ”

The illustrious Javád completed the entrusted mission and that afternoon
> returned forthwith with the celebrated Khál Akbar, who was able to attain
> Our presence. We said unto him, “It is hard for this Wronged-One to
> see that thou and the other members of the Afnán family have remained
> deprived of the Sacred Tree that hath appeared and ﬂourished amongst
> you.” He responded, “There are certain considerations that have prevented
> us from such acceptance.” We made reply, “What are those things that have
> caused you to hold back from the Exalted Horizon and the recognition of
the Sacred Tree? Present your questions.”

The following day he returned, and single and alone We met with him

> were revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will. That beloved and other
friends of course know such details.

On another day he came into Our presence and said, “Ill-fated is the one
who would peruse this Book, and yet fail in his belief.”426

> As part of his eﬀorts in the 1950s and 1960s to organize and classify the
> Afnán family papers, Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán located the actual two sheets
> of paper penned by the uncle of the Báb and presented to Baháʾuʾlláh.
> A facsimile of this document was given to Muhammad-ʿAlí Fayzí who
> published the same in Khándán Afnán, pages 41ﬀ. The following is a
> translation of the questions of the Khál Akbar, which occasioned the
revelation of the Kitáb-i Íqán:427

> One: What previously was believed is that the promised resurrection will take
> place in another world. The raising of the dead, the Bridge, the reckoning
> of the deeds of all creatures, and the reward or punishment of those deeds
> will take place in that world. However, [the Bábís claim that] it is all in this
> world, and it has taken place. Moreover, the days of the advent of every
> Manifestation of the True One constitute that same Day of Resurrection for
> the period preceding it. In this new Revelation, there has been no punish-
> ment for man’s deeds. Nay, the insurgence and corruption of the people of
> tyranny and oppression have increased, even if the real meaning of reward
> and punishment is nearness or remoteness from the Divine Court. This
> subject is the same, regardless of which world it occurs in. The People of
> Truth in this world, since they exist in God’s good pleasure, are in a state of
> fortune; but they are outwardly caught in the grip of the people of oppression
> and are persecuted by them. The people of oppression, although they are
> tormented by being far from the threshold of God, are outwardly in state
> of comfort and by reason of their ignorance are unaware of that torment.
> If the requital for men’s deeds and the promised reward and punishment be
> as described above, and there be no other world than this one, where will
> the oppressed seek vengeance from the one who oppressed him, and where
> will the people of punishment receive their justice? This is naught but a
> denial of the promised resurrection. I have not fathomed this subject fully,
> yet it is among the most important of matters to understand.
> Two: From the inception of Islam until now, it has been a belief of all the
> followers of the Shiʿi religion—a matter that no one has ever denied or even

> have been revealed by the Imáms—that the Twelfth Imám was born from the

> foundation, for it will not prove the cause of men’s guidance, rather it will
> cause them bewilderment. In some cases, a Tradition has come down that

> their outward meaning is in contradiction to the way in which the Imáms
> guided mankind. I would ask You to favor me with a clear explanation of
> this topic, in such a manner that it will create certainty in men’s hearts,
> that no one will be able to open up a path of doubt.
> Four: According to those Traditions that have come down to us from the
> sanctiﬁed Imáms concerning the time of the appearance of the Qáʾim, such
> as: “An enemy will raise an army in Syria and will battle Him at a place
> whose name They have speciﬁed as being between Syria and Mecca”; “The
> land shall be divided in two”; “An army of eight hundred thousand shall
> descend all together upon the land, except for two men, who shall remain
> behind”; “They shall go to the army of the Qáʾim and give him tidings”;
> “Then He [the Qáʾim] shall rule and shall make Kufa His capital”; “The
> size of His army shall be so great that they will demolish the mosque of
> Kufa and shall build a new one with one thousand doors”; etc. There are
> many such accounts in the reliable books of Traditions. Yet, not one of these
> things has happened. I beseech You to provide a full explanation of this
> matter, that it may be a cause of certainty for my heart, and, God willing,
> lead me to perfect faith.

> We are fortunate that a letter from the uncle addressed to his son, the
> Vakíluʾd-Dawlih, and written only a few days after the revelation of the
> Kitáb-i Íqán, has survived. This letter is dated 17 January 1861, and

> in early January 1861.428

Shoghi Eﬀendi, God Passes By, p. 138, has placed the revelation of the Kitáb-i Íqán
about a year later in AH 1278 or AD 1862.

O the best of the Protectors!

> To the city of Yazd, Saráy Khán, to be presented to my esteemed son,
> Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Taqí, the Shírází merchant, may he be ever-pros-
perous!

Loving light of mine eye, more precious to me than my soul, may God
> continue to enrich your life! I hope that you have lived under the care of
> the Almighty God and have been protected from all ills and wickedness,
> and have been auspicious in all your endeavors. If you wonder over our
> state, praise be to God and to His chosen Ones, on the night of the ﬁrst
> of Rajab [12 January 1861] we attained the threshold of the Shrines of the
> twin Imáms at Kázimayin, upon them be a thousand, thousand salutations
> and blessings. Your place was indeed empty. On your behalf, we oﬀered
> pilgrimage and prayers. God willing, the day after next, that is, on the
seventh of the month, we will depart this location.

We had a joyful journey en route, and snow did not fall during our
> travels, except for one night, and it rained for two days. However, we were
indoors, and the cold was not intolerable and caused no harm.

Praised be God, for what I have to write to you is that we attained unto
> the presence of His Holiness Bahá, upon Him be God’s peace. Your place
> was indeed empty. He showered us with the utmost aﬀection and kindness,
> and asked that we stay for the night, and we remained in His presence.
> The evident truth is that to be deprived of the blessing of His presence is
> a mighty and evident loss. May God bestow His grace upon us so that we
might everlastingly attain unto the blessing of His presence.

Kindly convey our greetings to the exalted Hájí Muhammad-Ibráhím;429

> his place is indeed empty. Also convey our best wishes to all the honored
friends. Peace be upon you!

5 Rajab AH 1277 [17 January 1861]
> The Kitáb-i Íqán, revealed in space of two days and nights by Baháʾuʾlláh,
> was initially known as the Risálih-i Khálawiyyih [The Treatise for the
> Uncle], but was later changed by Baháʾuʾlláh to its present title. The very
> copy of the Kitáb-i Íqán given to the uncle was in the hand of ʿAbduʾl-
> Bahá, and only in a few margins had Baháʾuʾlláh added comments or
> made alterations in His own hand. The Afnán family presented that copy
> to Shoghi Eﬀendi, and it is now displayed at the Baháʾí International
> Archives Building in Haifa.430

A famous and untiring teacher, titled Muballigh by Baháʾuʾlláh. At a later time,
mostly through his eﬀorts the Afnáns of Yazd converted to the Baháʾí Faith.

> copy of the Book of Certitude.

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 290                                                                                 7/10/2008 2:44:21 PM

In summation, it seems reasonable, therefore, to conclude that the
> purpose of the Kitáb-i Íqán was not to convert the uncle of the Báb, as
> he was already a believer. Rather, its goal was to disclose the full station
> of the young Prophet to the uncle and to enable him to see in the Báb
the same power and majesty as manifested by all the Prophets of old.

Subsequent to his meeting with Baháʾuʾlláh, the uncle of the Báb pro-
> ceeded to the ʿAtabát and, after having met with his sister, returned to
> Shíráz. There the believers came to meet him and to inquire of what had
> transpired in Baghdad. Upon meeting with Núriʾd-Dín, the Khál Akbar
> asked the former to also enlighten his sons as to the true station of the
> Báb as an independent Manifestation of God. Eventually, in the fall of
> 1866, Nabíl Aʿzam was instructed to proclaim the new Cause of Baháʾuʾlláh
> throughout the length and breadth of Iran. His arrival precipitated the
> conversion of the Khál Akbar and the remaining members of the Afnán
family in Shíráz to the Baháʾí Faith.431

The last question that remains to be answered is: In addition to the
> family’s claim as reported above, is there any evidence from the Khál
> himself to suggest that he actually believed in Baháʾuʾlláh? And if so, did
> he recognize in Him the Promised One of the Bayánic Dispensation? To
> answer these questions, we can do no better than to turn to the words of
the uncle of the Báb in his own ﬁnal will and testament:432

In the Name of God, the Glorious, the Most Glorious.

> These few words are written as my will in the middle of Dhiʾl-Qaʿdih AH
1291 [Circa 24 December 1874].

First, I testify to the oneness and singleness of God. He is sanctiﬁed and
> supreme from having a partner. I further testify that the exalted and hallowed
> Person Who declared Himself in AH 1260 [1844] is indeed in the truth
> and manifested the glory and ascendancy of the Almighty God. Whatsoever
> He decreed in His religion and all that He revealed of the divine spiritual
> stations, are all the manifest truth, and whosoever obeyed Him is among
> those that were saved, and those that opposed Him indeed rank as ones
> who have perished. Today, the one true religion of God is that which His
> Holiness [the Báb] ordained. And further, today, the author of the Dispensa-
> tion and the succor of this luminous community is the exalted and elevated
> Bahá, may my spirit and the spirit of the world be a sacriﬁce unto Him.
> His Manifestation is the same as the Báb’s Manifestation. Obedience unto
> Him, is obedience unto God, and opposing Him, is opposing God.

See chapter 6.

Immersed in an ocean of sin, because of the inﬁrmities of self, this servant
> concealed his convictions from all, even from his children and kinsmen. But
> now I have committed them to paper so that after my passing they become
> aware and strive to perceive the matter. God willing, they too will number
among those who believed.

I ask those who may come upon these pages, whether of my children or
> kinsmen, or of others, that after my passing, in accordance with the laws of
> the Bayán, they prepare me for burial by washing and wrapping [my body]
> in cloth. And if I was in Shíráz, to bury my remains there. . . . And should

> bury me anywhere that is possible, whether inside or outside the city. And
> should I pass away somewhere other than in Shíráz, then wherever I have
expired, bury me at that spot.

Of earthly possessions, let it be known that I have none that would

not able to do so, then they know best.

At the time of the writing of these pages, God is aware that if I were

There are some monies owed me, but these remain beyond collection.

APPENDIX FIVE

THE PATERNAL GENEALOGY OF THE BÁB

> In this appendix a brief biography of the paternal members of the Báb’s
> family will be given. Few of the Báb’s paternal relatives became Bábís or
> believed in Baháʾuʾlláh. However, several of His relatives played signiﬁcant
> roles in Bábí and Baháʾí history.

> Siyyid Mírzá Muhammad-Ridá
> The father of the Báb was the son and grandson of retail merchants.434 He
> owned a dry goods shop in the Bazaar Vakíl, a family business that had
> existed since the eighteenth century, and he had a house in the Bazaar
> Murgh district, the neighborhood where most of the Shíráz merchants
> lived. He married well, into the family of established wholesale import/
> export merchants. He had several children prior to the Báb, but none
> survived. His only surviving child was the Báb. He was forty-nine when
> he died. The Báb was probably nine at the time, although other accounts
> say that He was still an infant. Siyyid Muhammad-Ridá left a large enough
> inheritance to provide for his Son and widow.

> Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Hasan
> Known as Mírzáy-i Shírází, he was the greatest mujtahid of his day,
> considered the sole Marjaʿ Taqlíd [the source of emulation] for the Shiʿih
> world, which meant he was turned to as the guide and exemplar in all
> matters concerning the application of Islamic law. His father was Mírzá
> Mahmúd Khúshnivís, a resident of Shíráz famed for his calligraphy in the
> Nastaʿlíq style. Mírzáy-i Shírází was born on 5 May 1815 in Shíráz and
> received his initial education there at the age of four. Though originally

As given in chapter 1, the paternal genealogy of the Báb is: Siyyid Mír Muham-
> mad-Ridá, son of Mír Ibráhím, son of Mír Fathuʾlláh, son of Siyyid ʿAbid, son of Siyyid
> Lutfuʾlláh, son of Mír Muhammad Muʾmin Husayní Shírází. The Báb’s grandfather, Mír
> Ibráhím, had a brother by the name of Mír Ismáʿíl, who had a son named, Mírzá Mahmúd
> Khúshnivis [calligrapher]. Mírza Mahmúd in turn had three sons: Mírzá Muhammad-
> Hasan, known as Hujjatuʾl-Islam or Mírzáy-i Shírází; Mírzá ʿAlí-Akbar; and a third son
> who was a physician practicing in Karbalá.

> destined to follow his father’s career as a local oﬃcial, at the age of 18 he
> was sent to Isfahán, Iran’s foremost city of learning at the time. It was in
> this city that he met the Báb on several occasions and became an ardent
> believer, though he concealed his faith. In 1843 he traveled to Najaf,
> and at ﬁrst used to return frequently to Isfahán, until he began to attend
> the classes of Shaykh Murtidá Ansárí (1799–1864). It was then that he
> decided to settle in ʿIraq permanently. Gradually, he became known as
> the most prominent student of Shaykh Murtidá, who was acknowledged
as the leading mujtahid of the Shiʿih world.

When Shaykh Murtidá died, Mírzáy-i Shírází succeeded him as teacher
> of his circle of students. He went on pilgrimage to Mecca in 1871. Over
> the next few years, his stature among the other ʿulamá increased to the
> point that when Siyyid Husayn Turk died in 1882, Mírzáy-i Shírází
> became acknowledged as the sole Marjaʿ Taqlíd. He is also called Hujjatuʾl-
> Islám [the Proof of Islam], Ayatuʾlláh [the Sign of God], and Mujaddid
> [Renewer] by his biographers. In 1875, Mírzáy-i Shírází transferred his
> residence to Samarrá and remained there until his death, making this
provincial shrine city for a time a center of scholarship.435

In 1891–92 there occurred the famous protest against the Tobacco
> Régie. As a result of a fatwá,436 ﬁrst written and circulated by Hájí Mírzá
> Hasan Áshtiyání, but in December 1891 endorsed by Mírzáy-i Shírází,
> the Government of Iran and the foreign diplomatic establishment were
> amazed to observe an almost complete cessation of the use of tobacco. The
> Sháh was forced to capitulate, and the tobacco concession was cancelled.
> This incident proved to be a forerunner of the Constitutional Revolt of
a decade later.

Mírzáy-i Shírází died on 20 February 1895, and his body was carried
> from Samarrá to Najaf, where it was buried. Subsequent to his passing,
> prayer vigils were held for him throughout Iran, and Násiriʾd-Dín Sháh
> attended the one held in Tihrán.437

> Hájí Siyyid Javád Shirází
> He was a paternal relative of the Báb’s father and studied in ʿIraq and
> returned to Shíráz in the 1820s. In about 1832 he was sent to Kirmán by

He was the teacher of Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís, a Qájár Prince who was a leading voice for
reform in Iran and who is mentioned considerably in this volume.

> Karím Khán. When Quddús came to Kirmán in 1845 to announce the
> religion of the Báb to the Shaykhí leader, he stayed with Hájí Siyyid Javád
> who readily embraced the new Faith.439 Later he intervened on behalf of
> two Bábí teachers, Mullá Sádiq Khurásání and Mullá Yúsuf Ardabilí, when
> they were attacked in Kirmán. He passed away in AH 1287 [1870].

> Áqá Mírzá Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín
> A paternal relative of the Báb’s father, he was married to Zahrá Bagum<8>.
> Their son was Áqá Mírzá Áqá, known as Núriʾd-Dín. He became a Bábí
> after the martyrdom of the Báb and received a Tablet from Baháʾuʾlláh
> prior to his own passing in AH 1276 [1859]. He was a merchant but
> later retired to become a farmer.

> Mírzá ʿAlí-Akbar
> A second cousin of the Báb, he was a devoted believer and a close com-
> panion of Mírzá Asaduʾlláh Khúʾí, surnamed Dayyán. Mírzá ʿAlí-Akbar
> (and Dayyán) was murdered in Baghdad at the instigation of Mírzá Yahyá
> Azal, and Baháʾuʾlláh makes a reference to him in His Epistle to the Son
> of the Wolf and in yet another Tablet.440

Bástaní-Párizí, Kuchih Haft Pích, ch. 3, states that Sabzivarí desired the tutelage of
> Siyyid Javád to such a degree that on foot he traveled from his native Khurásán to Kir-
> mán, and when he arrived the period of enrollment for the Siyyid’s class was completed.
> Undaunted, Sabzivarí took a job as a janitor in that building, married the daughter of
> the building’s custodian, and stayed for the next six months to partake of these lectures.
> The same source further states that Siyyid Javád would commence his annual classes on
> the ﬁrst day of the Fall by reciting the opening two verses of Rúmí’s Mathnaví, and then
> spending the next six months oﬀering unsurpassed analysis and expositions, concluding
his last lecture on the day before Naw-Rúz.

One of the Bábís of Kirmán has left behind a large account of Quddús’ visit to that
> city, entitled Kitábuʾl-Quddúsiyyih, which the present translator has rendered into English
and which will soon appear in print.

APPENDIX SIX

THE AFNÁN FAMILY:
SOME BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES

> In the Writings of Baháʾuʾlláh, the term ʿAfnán’ is used to refer to the
> maternal family of the Báb. A deﬁnition is given in the following Tablet,
> revealed in honor of the martyred Mírzá ʿAlí-Muhammad Varqá (d.
1896):

> In response to your question about the meaning of the terms ‘Aghsán’ and
> ‘Afnánʾ, when the Supreme Pen hath mentioned the Afnán, We have intended
> the descendants of the Primal Point. Verily, in this Dispensation, all have
> been summoned to the Most Exalted Horizon and guided to the Most Great
> Ocean. At the beginning of Our Days, a special prayer was revealed for the
> Afnán, which ordained that they would be faithful to the Manifestation of
> God and recognize Him. God willing, they will arise to fulﬁl what hath
> been decreed for them and will remain ﬁrm and steadfast in the Cause of
> God. Blessed are those whom We have called by this name, Afnán. Ver-
> ily, the sweet fragrance of the All-Merciful hath been wafted from them.
> Moreover, We have established them as twigs of Our own Tree. Verily, this
> is Our favor upon them. We beseech God to protect them from the traces
> of the pen and the veils of knowledge. We have bestowed this gift on some
> in the Book, the contents of which are concealed from all save the Lord
> of Creation. Soon what hath been ordained for them by the Almighty, the
> All-knowing, will appear.441

> The term ‘Afnán’ is the plural of the word fanán, which in Arabic refers
> to a straight and verdant branch. In the Qurʾán’s Surih of Rahmán (the
> Merciful), the term was used to describe the celestial dwelling of the
> righteous. This dwelling has two heavenly trees, one of which is called ‘the
Afnán.ʾ442 Similarly, Islamic Traditions refer to a ﬁrm branch.443

The ﬁrst genealogy of the Báb’s family was oﬀered at the beginning
of The Dawn-Breakers by Shoghi Eﬀendi. The following table provides

Qurʾán 55:46–47.

> The following is a brief biographical sketch of the consanguineous members
> of the Afnán family who are mentioned in this volume or are of some
> other historical interest.444 The notes are in numerical order and use the
> same numbering system as the genealogy chart.

> <1> Mírzá ʿAbid
> A son of Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad. He was known as Mírzá Zaynuʾl-
> ʿAbidín.

> <2> Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad Husayn
> The Báb’s maternal grandfather.

> <3> Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí
> He was a wholesale merchant involved in importing and exporting through
> Shíráz and its port of Búshihr. He was married to Hájíyyih Bíbí.

> <4> Fátimih Bagum
> The mother of the Báb. She came from a well-known and highly respected
> cloth merchant family in Shíráz that traced its ancestry to Imám Husayn.
> She married Siyyid Muhammad-Ridá, a member of another merchant
> family from Shíráz. They had several children who did not survive. The
> only child to live to adulthood was Siyyid ʿAlí-Muhammad, the Báb<12>,
> who was born on 20 October 1819. When Fátimih Bagum’s husband died
> a few years later, she went to live in the house of her brother, Hájí Mírzá
> Siyyid ʿAlí<7>, who acted as her Son’s guardian. In 1842, she arranged
> for the marriage of her Son to Khadíjih Bagum<9> and lived with them
in their House.

When the Báb ﬁrst put forward His claim in 1844, Fátimih Bagum
> did not immediately become a believer, although her brother, Hájí Siyyid
> Mírzá Muhammad, inﬂuenced her to hold a sympathetic view of the
> movement.445 She was greatly distressed by the way Husayn Khán, the
> governor of Shíráz, treated her Son and by the raid that oﬃcials made
> on their House. When the Báb left Shíráz for Isfahán in October 1846,

> the people and government oﬃcials of the city continued to harass the
family.

According to Nabíl Aʿzam, before the Báb left Shíráz, He prepared His
> will and bequeathed the estate to His mother and His wife, with the whole
reverting to His wife, Khadíjih Bagum, when His mother died.446

News of her Son reached Fátimih Bagum only sporadically. When He
> was executed in Tabríz in 1850, the family kept the news from her for
> more than a year. The grief of the news and the hostility of friends and
> some family members ﬁnally caused her to move to Karbalá in Rabíʿuʾl-
> Avval AH 1268 [December 1851]. She took with her: Hájí Mubárak, the
> Ethiopian servant of the Báb purchased in Búshihr; Bíbí Gawhar, aunt of
> the Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih<99>; and her own mother.447 Later, Hájí ʿAbduʾl-
> Majíd and his wife, who were both Bábís, joined her. During this period,
> the family worried about her living in the ʿAtabát and, on at least one
> occasion, Khajídih Bagum considered visiting her. When she consulted
> Baháʾuʾlláh about this, He said: “In response to your letter stating that
> the mother of the Exalted One, may the spirit of all be a sacriﬁce to
> Him, wants you to travel to that land [Karbalá], know that this is most
> pleasing. Should you undertake this journey, it will assuredly be a source
of happiness for her.”448

Up to this time, Fátimih Bagum was not a Bábí. Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh<71>
> reports Baháʾuʾlláh’s stating that Mírzá Yahyá Azal’s action in marrying
> the Báb’s second wife drove Fátimih Bagum away from accepting the
> Faith. While Baháʾuʾlláh was in Baghdad, He arranged for the wife of
> Hájí ʿAbduʾl-Majíd and for Hájí Siyyid Javád Karbaláʾí, an old friend of
> Fátimih Bagum’s family, to speak to her about the Faith.449 Eventually,
> she became a believer. She continued to live in Karbalá until her death
> in about 1881.

Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúruʾl-Haqq, vol. 5, pp. 515–16, reports: “In accordance
> with His [Baháʾuʾlláh’s] instructions, the two of them spoke with her about the Cause.
> Expressing her deep regret, the Báb’s mother alluded to the shameful act of Mírzá Yahyá
> Azal in marrying the wife of the Báb from Isfahán days and remarked, ‘How is one to
> trust the faith of a people who marry His wife, while the blood of that Wronged One
> [the Báb] is still wet on the ground?!’ On returning to the presence of the Blessed Beauty,
> Siyyid Javád conveyed her objections. Baháʾuʾlláh was deeply saddened and responded,
> ‘Henceforth, do not speak with the mother of the Báb about this Cause, as she is grieved
> over what has happened. Indeed, no excuse can be oﬀered for the transgressions that she
> speaks of, and she is most assuredly correct about them.ʾ ”

In the Qayyumuʾl-Asmáʾ, Surih 28, the Báb refers to Fátimih Bagum
> as Ummuʾl-Muʾminin [mother of the believers] and Ummuʾdh-Dhikr
> [mother of the Remembrance]. Baháʾuʾlláh refers to her as Khayruʾn-Nisa
> [the best of women] and forbids all others, except Khadíjih Bagum, from
adopting this title.450

One of the objectives of the Ten Year Crusade was to locate the grave of
Fátimih Bagum. Thus far, the Iraq Baháʾís have not been able to do so.

> <5> Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad

Íqán. He was also known as Khál Akbar [great uncle].

Khál Akbar was born in 1798 and was a merchant. His wife, Hájíyyih
> Bíbí Fátimih-Sáhib, was a daughter of Hájí Muhammad-Muhsin and a
> member of another prominent merchant family trading in Shíráz and
> Búshihr. Khál Akbar ran the family oﬃce in Búshihr. The Báb was closely
> associated with him during the ﬁrst four years He worked as a merchant
there.

Several years before the Báb’s declaration, Khál Akbar was concerned
> that the Báb’s preoccupation with religious matters would create problems.
> Later, he met Mullá ʿAlí Bastámí, whom the Báb had sent as a messenger,
> and began to have a change of heart. The Báb stayed with him when He
> passed through Búshihr on His pilgrimage journey. On His return, the
> Báb stayed with him once more, arriving on 15 May 1845 and staying
> for 10 days before leaving for Shíráz. It seems that during this time the
> uncle recognized in the Báb unrivalled spiritual powers. When Khál Akbar
> returned to Shíráz, he fell under the suspicion attached to all members of
the Báb’s family, despite his outward protestations of orthodoxy.

In the late 1850s, the young Áqá Mírzá Áqá<24> began urging Khál
> Akbar to renew his commitment to the Bábí Faith and accept the Báb
> as the promised Qáʾim. Since his sister, the Báb’s mother, was living in
> Karbalá, he agreed to visit Baháʾuʾlláh while passing through Baghdad.
> He was received by Baháʾuʾlláh in early January 1861. At Baháʾuʾlláh’s
> request, he wrote out the questions that disturbed him about why the
> Báb had not literally fulﬁlled Islamic prophecies.451 Over the next two
> days and nights, Baháʾuʾlláh revealed the Kitáb-i Íqán in reply. After this,
> Khál Akbar became fully aware of the Báb’s station.

A second Tablet by Baháʾuʾlláh in honor of Zahrá Bagum reads:

> Sh[íráz]. The sacred leaf, the mother of the Afnán, upon her be the glory
of God, the Most Glorious.

He is Governor over the Supreme Horizon!

> O My leaf and mother of My Afnán, upon him rest forever the glory of
God, and His bounty and His mercy, in both the heavens and the earth!

You have endured in the path of God that which hath caused the hearts
> of the denizens of the cities of justice and equity to be ﬁlled with sorrow.
> Yet, since all that occurred was sustained in the path of God, then it is very
important and best to be patient and forbearing.

ordained for the Afnáns is such that naught besides can compare with it.

The world testiﬁes to its own evanescence. Every discerning person can

hear its cry and lamentation.

The station that the Supreme Pen hath decreed for the Afnáns is the

> <9> Khadíjih Bagum
> The wife of the Báb. She is occasionally referred to as Khadíjih-Sultán
Bagum.

Khadíjih Bagum was a cousin of the Báb’s mother. Marriages to cous-

As explained in previous chapters, Baháʾuʾlláh bestowed the custodian-
ship of the House of the Báb on Khadíjih Bagum:

Baháʾuʾlláh.

> In the Name of God, the Ruler, the Wise, the Ever-present Fashioner of
the heavens and the earth.

O you the near ones in Sh[íráz]! Under all conditions, the Supreme Pen
> hath testiﬁed and always will: God is Single, the One, the Almighty, the All-
> powerful, the All-conquering, the Omnipotent. He doeth as He pleaseth and
ordaineth whatever He willeth. He is the Compassionate, the Generous!

We have bestowed the custodianship of the Blessed House upon the
> exalted leaf, the wife of the Primal Point, and her sister, upon them rest
> the glory of God and His mercy and His favor. God hath granted the cus-
> todianship for this House. Verily, He is adorned with the robe of generos-
> ity and hath ﬁxed His seal on this command, for He is the Almighty, the
> Beloved. From her Lord, the Merciful, this honor and benevolence hath
> been bestowed upon the sister and her descendants. He is the Muniﬁcent
> and the Compassionate, and He is the Generous and the Bounteous.460

> A Tablet was revealed shortly after the passing of Khadíjih Bagum.461 It
> is dated 17 Muharram AH 1300 (28 November 1882) and is addressed
> to Núriʾd-Dín.462 It indicates that while Khadíjih Bagum was sending her
> ﬁnal letter to Baháʾuʾlláh, the Supreme Pen was in spiritual commune with
her and was responding to her message:

> . . . I beseech Thee, O Possessor of all names and Creator of the heavens, to

> Thee, and to bestow upon him a measure of Thy patience and to enable

> patience must be observed in all situations. This hath been revealed by the
> One Who is to be obeyed. May the Almighty God adorn all with the robe
of His patience. He is suﬃcient unto all creation.

> Baháʾuʾlláh was greatly disappointed about what had led to Khadíjih
> Bagum’s untimely death. He revealed the following for Núriʾd-Dín on 4
Rabíʿuʾl-Avval AH 1301 (3 January 1884):

> The honored Afnáns,465 upon them rest all My glory, the Most Glorious,
> arrived in Beirut and, afterwards, by Our leave, gradually and individually
> arrived here. Having entered the canopy of Our favors and might, one by
> one they returned. Regarding what had happened, they stated that their plan
> was that, after arriving in Beirut, Siyyid ʿAlí would return to Sh[íráz] to
> accompany the exalted leaf to this land of God. They stated that they had
> designed the plan in this way because they feared going to Sh[íráz] any earlier
> might provoke the foes and enemies to act and prevent all from attaining
> Our presence. It was even asserted that, despite such caution, the enemies
> caused disturbances along the way; but creation, protection, and liberty are
> all in the hands of God, and He is the All-bountiful, the All-generous. In
> short, such excuses were heard from one after another. But the Lord hath
knowledge of all things; He is the All-knowing, the All-informed.

Nevertheless, it would have been best [if they had] carried out the wishes
> of the illustrious exalted leaf, as this was most pleasing and acceptable to
> God; but it was otherwise ordained. The One True God is My witness! Our
> heart hath melted in agony that she was deprived of this pilgrimage, and all
> the dwellers under the tabernacle of purity and might are most sorrowful
> and despondent. At one point, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these exalted
> words: “O ʿAbd-i Hadir![ever-present servant] The eﬀect of what hath hap-
> pened may well appear on earth.” More recently, this utterance was spoken
> by His blessed Tongue: “Write to My Afnán [who had promised to escort
> the Báb’s wife] that we agreed and consented to the exalted leaf ’s request.
> Currently, the honored persons continue to stand ready and prepared to
> fulﬁl that promise, though they have not spoken of it.” He further stated,
> “Write of this matter to the Afnán, upon him be the glory of God, as he
> was well aware of such a promise beforehand. We desired to fulﬁl what We
> had assured the exalted leaf.”466

> It seems that there was considerable interest among certain Baháʾís of

> Our presence and made the same request, the Tongue of the King of Cre-

> In the following Tablet, the Master issued instructions about the sacred-
ness of the resting-place of Khadíjih Bagum:

upon him be the glory of God, the Most Glorious.

O Afnán of the Tree beyond which there is no passing and of the friends
> of the Blessed Beauty! The sacred House [of the Báb] and the point of
> adoration of the denizens of the Concourse on High must be protected
> and preserved with the greatest wisdom and looked after and cared for with
> exhaustive eﬀort. This Servant is but one of the attendants of that Threshold.
> Therefore, consider how truly precious that pinnacle of divine veneration is

of that sanctiﬁed altar.

Concerning the sacred, fragrant, and resplendent sepulcher of the illus-

All the Afnáns had oﬃces in the Saray-i Khajih and controlled the city’s

[current] beliefs because of their holy lineage.”

The honored Hájí Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí, who was an uncle of the Báb, would

> magniﬁcent oﬃce, were pillars of commerce and employed a large staﬀ
> of secretaries, accountants, attendants, and others. Despite their immense
> wealth and attainments, they were nevertheless very lowly and humble. It
was truly astonishing and bewildering.

One of them was the honored Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Taqí, the Vakíluʾd-

> pedestrians would pause and, with great respect, defer to him, often bowing
> low before him. When a dispute took place between the merchants, they
> invariably would consider his word the ﬁnal say and deciding factor. The

was almost complete.479

In mid-1900, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá wrote to him conﬁdentially about the
> troubles that surrounded Him in the Holy Land and instructed him to
form the Universal House of Justice in the event of His slaying:

> As to ʿAbduʾl-Bahá, He is now in very great danger, beset by countless grave

> you must unite them in spirit and purpose, and let them join in harmony
> and concord with the Hands of the Cause, so that the Universal House
> of Justice may be formed as far as this is practicable and the provisions of
> the Will and Testament can be implemented when this is necessary. It is
> incumbent upon the Afnán of the holy Tree to stand in the forefront and
> to shield and protect the mighty stronghold of the Cause of God. In this
> way, they will become the recipients of such favors as will beneﬁt the station
> that has been graciously conferred upon them.480

A short but important biography of the Vakíluʾd-Dawlih was written by Charles
Mason Remey, Star of the West, 7 February 1916.

See Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, pp. 118–25. One of the notebooks of the Vakíluʾd-

> Vakíluʾd-Dawlih’s correspondence with Siyyid Muhammad, a son of Mírzáy-i Shírází, is
in the private hands of his descendants.

It is noted in his biography in Fasáʾí, Fársnámih Násirí, vol. 2, p. 45, that, due to
> economic depression in Fárs and family bankruptcy, Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí went
> to China for 10 years. There, he became the main contact for the opium trade of the
> merchants of Isfahán, Yazd, and Fárs. In the Writings of Baháʾuʾlláh, he is referred to as
“the Afnán in China.” See Baháʾuʾlláh’s Tablet in Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, p. 83.

He married his maternal cousin, daughter of Hájí ʿAbduʾl-Husayn.

See ʿAbduʾl-Bahá, Memorials of the Faithful, pp. 16–21.

The news of this achievement was communicated on 14 June 1959 by the Hands

one of those who believed.

Áqá Mírzá Áqá was a merchant, trading in partnership with other

> and Baháʾí, the family trading business prospered. In March 1879, two

> the name Núriʾd-Dín Hasan and organized the Rúhaniyyih Company. In
> July 1891 at Baháʾuʾlláh’s invitation, he and his family came to the Holy
> Land, where they stayed for nine months. During this period, Baháʾuʾlláh
revealed the Tablet of the World in his honor. It states:

> O Afnán, O thou that has branched from Mine ancient Stock! My glory
and My loving-kindness rest upon thee.

How vast is the tabernacle of the Cause of God! It hath overshadowed
> all the peoples and kindreds of the earth, and will, ere long, gather together
> the whole of mankind beneath its shelter. Thy day of service is now come.
> Countless Tablets bear the testimony of the bounties vouchsafed unto you.
> Arise for the triumph of My Cause and, through the power of thine utter-
> ance, subdue the hearts of men. Thou must show forth that which will
> ensure the peace and the well-being of the miserable and the downtrodden.
> Gird up the loins of thine endeavor, that perchance thou mayest release the
> captive from his chains, and enable him to attain unto true liberty.492

> A little more than a year after Áqá Mírzá Áqá returned to Egypt, ʿAbduʾl-
> Bahá instructed him to go to Shíráz to defend the Baháʾí Faith against
> the Covenant-breakers there. He went to Yazd with the Vakíluʾd-Dawlih

> <26> Siyyid Ahmad
> A brother to Hájí Siyyid Mírzá<25>. Siyyid Ahmad was a merchant, living
for a while in Yazd and then in ʿIshqábád, busied with commerce.

He was a deeply devoted believer who traveled to ʿAkká to see
> Baháʾuʾlláh. While there, he learned that he was being accused of theft
> in Istanbul. He hurried to that city and suﬀered bitterly at the hands
> of the foes, including an enemy of the Baháʾí Faith by the name of
> Muhammad-ʿAlí Isfahání. However, he was able to prove his innocence
> and establish their slander.495 In one of Baháʾuʾlláh’s Tablets, He says about
> this event, “There were several tormentors in Istanbul who perpetrated
> great harm on the honored Afnán, Áqá Siyyid Ahmad. Since the honored
> Afnán was meek and gentle, these men manifested the greatest oppres-
> sion, spoke disreputable slanders, and incited other lowlifes and ruﬃans
against him.”496

After this incident, Siyyid Ahmad again attained the presence of
> Baháʾuʾlláh in ʿAkká and stayed until after His ascension. Subsequently,
> he traveled to promote the Baháʾí Faith and once more returned to ʿAkká,
where the Master showered His favors on him.

In 1899, he went to ʿIshqábád and from there to Yazd, where he estab-
> lished the ﬁrst Spiritual Assembly of that city.497 He eventually moved

In his Naw-Rúz 113 BE letter to the Baháʾís of the East, Shoghi Eﬀendi recognized

> all others. He hath brought joy to ʿAbduʾl-Bahá for the rest of eternity. Now
> he liveth close to the sacred Threshold and protects that hallowed ground.
He is blessed now and will be until his end.

Praise be to God that thou art engaged in service in his place. This too
is a great blessing that cannot be calculated.

He was born in Shíráz in 1869 and was reared by Khadíjih Bagum. His

> He also asked his son to look after the needs of the believers from the
> surrounding regions who visited Shíráz. Once a year, he was to visit all the
> Baháʾí communities in the province and support their activities and cheer
> their hearts. From his teens, Áqá Siyyid Áqá was constantly traveling on
> behalf of the Baháʾí Faith. He sent reports of his activities to Baháʾuʾlláh,
Who sent encouragement in numerous Tablets. One Tablet reads:522

He is the Revealer, the Wise.

> The Tongue of the Merciful saith: O My friend and son of My Afnán! The
> robe of honor hath been cut and prepared for thy temple. The Supreme
> Pen hath revealed for thee that to which no created thing can be compared.
> Wherefore, render thanks unto thy Lord that thou hast branched from God

> abasement in His Cause is indeed the source of honor and the dawning-
place of divine favor.

In truth, ere long the Almighty, the Fashioner of both worlds, will make
> manifest such matters that, were others to be apprised of them, they would
> verily circumambulate around thee. Soon, they will realize what they have
> lost, on the Day when people will arise for their Lord, the Creator of the
Worlds.

Fleeting, temporal things are not worthy of consideration. Ears were not
> made to hear them, nor eyes meant to look upon them. By God, they are
in evident loss.

The Perspicuous Book stands evident, and the Mother Book has been

Afnán. The honored Áqá Siyyid Áqá.

He is God, the Forgiver, the Generous.

O My Afnán, upon thee rest My glory! Thy station is that of guiding the

Literally, “bayán,” a reference to the Báb’s Revelation.

INBMC 51:348, no. 354. Also quoted in Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, pp. 220–21.

About this, Baháʾuʾlláh notes, “Recently the Afnáns and Amín—upon them be My
> glory and loving kindness—attained Our presence and beheld Our countenance; likewise
> Nabíl, the son of Nabíl, and the son of Samandar—upon them rest the glory of God and
> His loving kindness—are present and have drunk the cup of reunion. We entreat God that

> outpouring of His blessings and grace may descend upon them from the heaven of His
> generosity and the clouds of His tender compassion” (Tablets of Bahá ʾuʾlláh, pp. 73–74). In
> addition to the two Afnáns, Baháʾuʾlláh is referring to Hájí ʿAbduʾl-Hasan Amín, Shaykh
Muhammad-ʿAlí Nabíl, and Áqá Shaykh Ahmad Nabílí of Qazvín.

spirit, My essence, My whole being, and My reality be a sacriﬁce to Him.

Therefore, render thanks to the one true God that thou art favored with

> Mírzá Jalál married three times. The ﬁrst marriage was to Mah-Talʿat, a

Tablets in his honor, including the following:

> Afnán. The honored Mírzá Buzurg, upon him rest the glory of God, the
Most Glorious.

He is the Sustainer of Truth and the Upholder of Justice.

> ʿAbduʾl-Bahá revealed numerous Tablets for Mírzá Buzurg. The following

Egypt from his pilgrimage to the Holy Land:

> Egypt. The illustrious Afnán of the sacred Lote-Tree, the honored Mírzá
Buzurg, upon him rest the glory of God, the Most Glorious.

> O wondrous oﬀshoot of the sacred Lote-Tree! I am very sorry and sad that,
> during thy journey, it was not possible to provide appropriate hospitality
> for that twig of the Lote-Tree. I certainly regret this. However, over this
> time, various troubles, numerous diﬃculties, and the onslaught of a number
> of injustices, from both within and without, robbed me completely of the
> opportunity to suitably serve the friends or lovingly associate with them. As
> thou didst thyself perceive, various diﬃculties had to be suddenly resolved.
Therefore, it was considered better for thee to leave.

However, at all times, I am concerned as to how such a foreign land is
treating thee. Be sure to write about the details of thy situation.

of God, the Most Glorious.

> O twin oﬀshoots of the sanctiﬁed Tree! Your letters arrived, but a response

> receipts ye had asked for, they were sent earlier but apparently were lost in
the post, and so a second copy is enclosed.

Ye asked a number of questions about the House. Know that these are all

Six months ago, the two caskets arrived in Haifa after enormous diﬃcul-

for the Shrine of Baháʾuʾlláh.

After that, I sent Mírzá Asaduʾlláh, with several others, to bring the sacred

Master is reported to have alluded to His own imminent passing.542

He was supremely serene, remarkably composed and calm.

When he learned of the appearance of the Báb’s holy revelation and the

> rose up and spoke with exceptional eloquence in praise of the Manifestation
> of the Light on Sinai, so that he burst into ﬂame with the ﬁre of the love
> of God. He was indeed a sign of the oneness of God and an ensign of the
> glorious Lord. In the school of exposition and eloquence, he was a worthy
> teacher. Those that heard him were left joyous and happy from the beauty
of his expression and words.

Continuously, his letters reached the sacred Threshold, and the Blessed
> Beauty would say with great joy, “Read the letters of Múvaqqariʾd-
> Dawlih!” Baháʾuʾlláh would soon send replies. These were evidence that
> Baháʾuʾlláh showed him great love and kindness. In fact, it could be said
> that Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih was present there in reality. Often, Baháʾuʾlláh
> addressed him in this way, “O thou who hast branched from this holy
> Tree.” Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih, in turn, always became exuberant and joyous
> from the glances of the loving kindness of the Speaker on Sinai. The news
> of his joy and excitement would always reach the Holy Land and make the
servants of God happy.

[This continued] until the Sun of Truth set from this world and shone
> from the unseen world. The news of Baháʾuʾlláh’s ascension plunged the
> Afnán into such distress and anguish that he couldnʾt speak for a while,
> and the ﬂow of his writing and exposition was stilled. Day and night, this
> companion was downcast; at dawn and in the night season, he was encom-
> passed with sorrow and tears. I wrote to him and maintained contact with
> him until he was rekindled and became reinvigorated and eager to begin
serving the Cause of God again.

For some time, he worked for the government on the coast of the Sea of
> Oman. His administration was based on justice and equity. All the towns
> and cities of the southern provinces appreciated his sagacious rule, and
> everyone lauded his eﬀorts to improve their state aﬀairs. It was universally
> said that his rule was without equal and his administration of justice without
> prejudice to anyone. During the days of his rule, his primary objective was
> to improve the living conditions of the people. At all times, his praise was
> widely sung in those areas, and all the friends would rejoice to hear news
> of him. After some time, he went to India, and in the years he lived there,
> friend and foe would proclaim, “Here is one who is the standard-bearer of
> justice and one of its shining lights.” He was supremely serene and had an
undisturbable, self-possessed calmness.

Although everyone knew that he was a Baháʾí and, indeed, was related
> to the holy Tree, the enemies of the Cause showed him great respect and
> consideration. All the great ones of Iran—traders, businessmen, and travel-
> ers—sought his company and showed him love and respect. He was indeed
> a great luminary. Some time later, they asked him to go to Tihrán, where
he met the ministers of the Iranian government.

But the bird of his heart—the bird of the rose garden of divinity—always

A supplication for the progress of the soul of the Afnán of the sacred
Lote-Tree, the illustrious Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih:
> O God, my God! How can I make mention of Thee and of the ﬁre of long-
> ing that burns in the heart of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá and the ﬂame of sorrow and loss
> that ignites His being because of the great aﬄiction that has surrounded
Thy sincere ones? O Thou the Lord of the heavens above!

Tears are pouring down, and our hearts are aﬂame because of the calamity
> that hath befallen us. On its account, the cry of lamentation and weeping
> hath been raised from the hearts of Thy loved ones and the breasts of Thy
> servants. O Lord! In Thy grace, Thou callest to Thy presence in the King-
> dom above those that have achieved certitude and have believed in Thee.
> Thou biddest them to return to the Paradise that is their true home. But
> Thou hast forsaken me, alone and desolate in this world, broken-winged
> and bereft of hope, deep in the sea of sorrows, and languishing in depriva-
tion on this earth.

O God, my God! How long wilt Thou leave me in this state of abject
> lowliness, burning with the ﬁre of separation from Thee, whilst Thou ordain-
est for those that are nigh unto Thee ascension unto the highest summit?

O God, my God! My body is melting away, my hair is white, and I have
> grown old. I have no strength to arise and serve Thy loved ones, whom Thou
hast singled out to raise Thy word and spread Thy fragrances.

O Lord, my Lord! Hasten My ascension unto Thy sublime threshold and
> My arrival in the world above and the court of Thy grace. Hasten my admit-
tance to Thy gift of forgiveness and pardon in Thine inﬁnite Kingdom.

O my God! Thy meek and humble servant, who beseeched Thee—the
> twig that had branched from the holy Tree, named Múvaqqar—hath left
> this ephemeral world and is now pleading to return to the everlasting
> world. Lord, he hastened to Thee with a hopeful heart, throbbing in Thy
> love. His tears were overﬂowing, and his patience had ended. He could no
> longer wait to meet Thee. He had believed in Thee and Thy verses. He had
> become attracted by Thy fragrances. He had become enkindled with the ﬁre
> burning in the Tree of Thy unity. He had sought comfort in Thy remem-
> brance. He was content with Thy providence and hath now hastened to Thy
> shelter.

O God! He was a bird warbling in Thy garden, a lion roaring in Thy
> forests, and a whale swimming in Thine ocean, until the world of existence
> became too narrow for him. So when the day of his destiny came, he
> returned to Thee with a heart attracted to Thee, his countenance radiant,
> tears of joy ﬂowing from him, exulting in the knowledge of Thy forgive-
ness and pardon.

O Lord! Raise his station! Ordain all good for him and grant him the
> glances of Thy favor. Immerse him in the sea of mysteries in the Kingdom
> of Light, in that assembly where Thy Beauty is manifest. Thou art the
> Generous, the Exalted, and Thou art the Forgiving, the Compassionate,
and the Merciful.

APPENDIX SEVEN

FÁRS AND SHÍRÁZ

> Iran has had a long, rich, and complex history—a history comprising
> many cycles of expansions, invasions, revivals, survivals, and reversals of
> fortune. From the very beginning, the history of Iran has been inexorably
> tied to the Province of Fárs. The Iranian-speaking Aryan tribes ﬁrst came
> to northern Fárs in the middle Paleolithic period; later the valleys of the
> Kur and Pulwar Rivers became their centers and remained so until the
time of the Sassanid Dynasty in the seventh century AD.

Cyrus the Great founded the Achaemenian Dynasty (559–330BC) in
> Fárs, and his son Darius the Great (reigned 522–486BC) built Persepolis
> where the Pulwar ﬂows into the Kur on the plain of Marv-Dasht. The
> nucleus of their Empire was called Persis and had its seat in the royal
> cities of Pasargadae and Persepolis. The kings of Achaemenian were wise
> and benevolent, ruling their empire for 229 years until Alexander the
> Macedonian founded the Seleucidian Dynasty (311BC), spreading all
> across Iran, where he founded many new towns in the Párs (Fárs) region.
> Párs was part of this dynasty until the period of Antioukhous IV. After
> the Parthians liberated the central parts of the Seleucidian Empire, Párs
became an independent state.

Another town on the banks of the Pulwar, called Istakhr in the Middle
> Ages, was the focal point of the Sassanian Dynasty (224–651, founded
> by Ardishir Babakan). Other cities of Fárs, such as Shíráz, Fasá, Siraf, and
> Arrajan, later outshone Istakhr in terms of size and signiﬁcance. Coins
> found in the region as early as 250BC have imprints of Pahlaví scripts
with Iranian ﬁgures and Zoroastrian braziers.

Muslim Arabs ﬁrst invaded Iran during the reign of ʿUmar, the second
> caliph. The people of Fárs displayed much bravery in face of the invading
> Arabs and in 638 defeated the Ibn Hazrami forces. In spite of Iranian
> resistance, ultimately towns in Fárs submitted to the Muslims and by
force were converted to Islam.

In the tenth century, at the time of the caliphate’s weakness, Fárs was
> overtaken by Yaʿqúb Laís, the founder of the Saﬀarian Dynasty, and
> Shíráz became their capital. Yaʿqúb’s brother constructed the city’s Jumʿih
> mosque. Subsequently, Fárs fell into the hands of the next set of rulers,
> Al-i Buyih and Siljukians. And with the demise of the latter, Ibn Mudúd

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 361                                                                  7/10/2008 2:44:33 PM

> established Atábakan Dynasty in the province and ruled until 1149 when
the Mongols invaded the entire region.

In 1353, the Al-i Muzafar Dynasty came to power in Fárs and ruled
> until 1490. With the founding of the Safavid Dynasty at the beginning
> of the sixteenth century, the entire country, including Fárs, was compelled
to adopt Shiʿi sect of Islam.

In short, throughout history, Fárs ﬂourished and waned according to
> the fortunes of the ruling party. Often Shíráz served as various monarchs’
> capital, but eventually power, money, and inﬂuence shifted to the north-
> erly cities of Tihrán and Isfahán. Fárs nevertheless remained a signiﬁcant
> commercial and cultural center. Today, its capital, Shíráz, is not only the
> bustling hub of commerce for the Fárs region but also one of the most
> industrialized cities in Iran. It is a major destination for tourists who
> appreciate historical sites and art centers and who wish to pay homage
at the tombs of the poets Saʿdí and Háﬁz.

Several nomadic ethnic groups, including the Qashqáʾís, Buyír-Ahmadís,
> Lurs, Khamsih, and Kuh-Kiluyih, continue to inhabit Fárs. Nomads typi-
> cally spend summers on the high plateaus and move south to the Persian
> Gulf in winter to search for pastures for their herds; others spend winters
> in a city. These groups represent not only an economic mode of produc-
> tion but also a lifestyle that has strong cultural and traditional roots in
many parts of Iran.551

At the present, Fárs remains one of the largest Iranian provinces, with an
> area of 133,294 square kilometers. In 1998, this province had a population
> of 4.2 million people of whom 42% resided in rural areas and the rest
> were urban settlers. It is a region with great historical signiﬁcance.

Geography and Climate of Fárs

> The Zagros mountain chain crosses the province from the northwest
> towards the southeast, dividing the province into two distinct parts.
> The ﬁrst is located in the north-northwest, while the second is located
> in the south-southeast area of the province, and both are mountainous
> highlands. The north part starts from Semirum elevations and ends south
> of Ábádih, at the point called Kuh ʿAzimat, and its arduous pass. The
> southern part consists of the highlands of the Shíráz area, including the

> Maharlu, Kharman, and Tudaj Mountains. The western section is the
> prolongation of Kuh-Kiluyih highlands towards the Mamasaní Mountains,
> and the southern region includes the Dáráb Mountains and the Tangistan
Highland.

There are three distinct climatic regions in Fárs. First, the mountainous
> area of the north and northwest with moderate cold winters and mild sum-
> mers. Second, the central regions, with relatively rainy mild winters and
> hot dry summers. The third region is located in the south and southeast.
> Due to lower altitude and mountain position, the quantity of rainfall in
> winter is lower than in spring and autumn. It has moderate winters with
> very hot summers.

Shíráz

> There was probably a sizable settlement on the site of Shíráz in prehis-
> toric times, and cuneiform records from the great ceremonial capital of
> Persepolis show that Shíráz was a signiﬁcant township in Achaemenian
> times. According to the ancient Elamite clay tablets found in Persepolis,
> the name for this city was written Tirazis. Phonetically, this is interpreted
> as tiracis or ćiracis. This name became Old Persian sirájis; through sound
> change comes the modern Persian name Shíráz.552 Under the Sassanians,
it became one of the main cities of the Province of Fárs.553

However, the city only became the provincial capital in 693, after the
> Arab armies conquered Istakhr, the nearby Sassanian capital.554 As Istakhr
> fell into decline, Shíráz grew in importance under the Arabs and several
> local dynasties. The Buyids (945–1055) made it their capital, building
> mosques, palaces, a famous library, and a great city wall. The invading
> Mongols spared the city when its local ruler oﬀered tributes and submis-
> sion to Genghis Khan, and the city reached new heights of prosperity
> under the Mongols (1220–1380). Shíráz was again spared by Timberline
> when in 1382 the local monarch, Shah Shujaʿ, agreed to submit to the
> invader, even oﬀering the hand of his granddaughter to a grandson of
> Timberline.

The name Shíráz also appears on clay seals found at Qasr-i Abu Nasr, a Sassanid
ruin, east of the city.

The city is referred to in Hudúduʾl-ʿalam al-Mashriq ila al-Maghrib, p. 126, where
> two ﬁre temples and a fortress called Shammubad are reported. Hamduʾlláh Mustawﬁ also
veriﬁes the existence of pre-Islamic settlements in Shíráz in Nushatuʾl-Qulub, p. 112.

Shíráz fell into Arab hands in 641, and Istakhr fell in 653.

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 363                                                                               7/10/2008 2:44:33 PM

After Shah Shujaʿ’s death, there was a turbulent succession of rulers for
> several years, until Timberline appointed his son as ruler of the city. In the
> thirteenth century, Shíráz became a leading center of the arts and letters
> due to the encouragement of its enlightened ruler and the presence of
> many scholars and artists. For this reason the city was named by classical
> geographers the Daruʾl-ʿIlm [the realm of knowledge]. Many of the most
> important Iranian poets, mystics, and philosophers were born in Shíráz
> and contributed to the fame of the city. Among them are numbered the
> poets Saʿdí and Háﬁz, the mystic Rúzbihán, and the philosopher Mullá
Sadrá.

Throughout the Safavid Empire (1502–1722) Shíráz remained a pro-
> vincial capital, and Imám Qulí Khán, the governor of Fárs under Shah
> ʿAbbás I, constructed many palaces and ornate buildings in the same style
> of those built in the same period in Isfahán, the capital of the empire.555
> During this period, the city attracted a number of European traders who
> exported its famous wine. After the fall of the Safavid, Shíráz suﬀered a
> period of decline worsened by several earthquakes in the region, the raids
> of the Afghans, and the rebellion of its governor against Nadir Shah. The
> latter sent troops to subdue the revolt, and the city was besieged for many
> months and eventually sacked. At the time of Nadir Shah’s assassination in
> 1747, most of the historic buildings of the city were damaged or ruined,
> and its population dropped to 50,000, a quarter of what it was in the
sixteenth century.

Shíráz soon returned to prosperity under the enlightened rule of Karím
> Khán Zand, who made it the capital during his reign in 1762. Although
> master of virtually all of Iran, Karím Khán refused to take the title of
> king and contented himself with that of Vakíl [regent]. Karím Khán was
> a wise ruler and one of the greatest patrons of the arts in Iranian history.
> Employing more than 12,000 workers, he constructed a royal district with
> a fortress, many administrative buildings, a mosque, and one of the ﬁnest
> covered bazaars in Iran. He had a moat built around the city, constructed
a clever irrigation and drainage system, and rebuilt the city walls.

However Karím Khán’s heirs failed to secure his gains, and when Ághá
> Muhammad Khán, the founder of the Qájár Dynasty, eventually came
> to power, he wreaked his revenge on Shíráz by destroying the city for-
> tiﬁcation and moving the national capital to Tihrán in 1789. Although

In 1630, a ﬂood destroyed a large segment of the city, which was later mostly rebuilt.
Another ﬂood hit the city in 1668.

> lowered to the rank of provincial capital, Shíráz maintained a level of
> prosperity as a result of the continuing importance of the trade route to
> the Persian Gulf, and its governorship was a royal prerogative throughout
> the Qájár era (1795–1925). Many of the beautiful gardens, buildings, and
> residences built during the nineteenth century contribute to the current
look of the city.556

During the Pahlaví era, large capital projects were funded for Shíráz to
> revive the grandeur of Achaemenid Persia. The 2500th anniversary of the
> Persian Empire and the large ﬂow of investment in Pahlaví University were
> notable projects among others drawn up for this purpose, giving Shíráz
a prominent status among Iranian cities by the late 1970s.

More recently, a number of restoration and reconstruction projects
> have taken place in Shíráz. Among these projects are the restoration of
> the Karím Khán Fortress and Vakíl Bath; plans for the preservation of
> the Old City quarter; renovation of the Qurʾán Gate and the mausoleum
> of the poet Khajú Kirmaní, both located in the Alláh-Akbar canyon; and
> the expansion of the Háﬁz mausoleum. The Iram and Qavám aromatic
> ﬂower gardens are popular points of attraction. The population of the
> city was estimated at 1.16 million in 1998.

Other Notable Towns in Fárs

> In addition to Shíráz, the other important towns in Fárs that are referred
> to in the present volume include: Ábádih, Ardakán, Bávanát, Dáráb,
> Istahbánát, Fasá, Fíruz-Ábád, Jahrum, Kázirún, Lár, Mamasaní, Marv-
> Dasht, and Nayríz. They are brieﬂy described below.

> Ábádih
> Located about 640 km. south of Tihrán, this city dates back to antiquity.
> However, the town was developed in earnest after Karím Khán Zand chose
> Shíráz as the nation’s capital. Ábádih is the mountainous, northernmost
> city of Fárs and is located at an altitude of 2,000 m. in a vast plain known
> as Sarhad. It has fertile lands that attract tribes such as the Qashqáʾí in
> summer and spring. Various religious and historical monuments have
> remained from past ages.

Shíráz suﬀered two major earthquakes in 1824 and 1853, resulting in considerable
damage though a number of historic buildings were spared.

Persian Languages

> An evolved version of the ancient Persian tongue—known as Fársí or Pársí,
> both derived from the Hellenized form Persis of the root word Párs—is
> widely spoken today in Iran, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan. This lan-
> guage belongs to the Iranian branch of the Indo-Iranian language family
> and has had a rich heritage and continues to evolve.

> Old Persian
> Old Persian was contemporaneous with Avestan, another Old Iranian
> language. Old Persian is preserved through cuneiform tablets found in the
> remains after the Achaemenid Dynasty. The oldest traces of Old Persian
> date to the sixth century BC, but it was spoken until the third century
> BC. Old Persian was spoken in southwestern Iran, while Avestan was
> spoken in northeastern Iran. In addition to the two languages, there must
> have been at least a third. Median is mentioned by the Greek historian
> Herodotus. It is believed that there must have been a fair level of mutual
> intelligibility among the Iranian languages of this period, and more than
> there would be in later periods.

> Middle Persian
> Middle Persian was contemporaneous with Parthian, and during the
> Arsacid Period, Persian was strongly inﬂuenced by Parthian. Middle

> Persian was the language used in the Sassanian Empire and was called
> Pahlaví. Middle Persian was, like Old Persian, spoken in southwestern
> Iran; Parthian was spoken in the north, while a group of languages
> (Khwarezmian, Sogdian, and Saka) were spoken in southeast. The gram-
> mar of Middle Persian was simpler than Old Persian’s. The script used
> was an ambiguous script with multivalent letters, derived from Aramaic.
> Middle Persian would last until the ninth century, although its decline
> began with the introduction of Arabic two centuries earlier.

> Modern Persian
> Modern Persian, known as Fársí, the language of Iran today, was devel-
> oped as early as the ninth century. It was in many ways a continuation of
> Middle Persian, but there were important inﬂuences coming from other
> Iranian languages. Modern Persian used an expanded form of Arabic
> writing, introducing letters like ch, p, zh, g, and changing the pronuncia-
> tion of Arabic zh into za. There is also a large inclusion of Arabic words
> in Modern Persian, by some estimates exceeding 40%. The grammar of
> Modern Persian is simpler than Middle Persian’s (just as Middle Persian
> was simpler than Old Persian). Most of the inﬂectional systems are lost,
> and there is no system of case inﬂection. Possession is shown by a suﬃx
> called izaﬁh. Tense, mood, voice, and negative are likewise indicated by a
> series of preﬁxes and inﬁxes (word elements inserted inside a word).

> O Muhammad, when the fragrances of holiness have drawn thee unto

a thousand years as you number them.

And when thou hast journeyed from thy self and from the world and

where thou art and say:

> one. Open my eyes through Thy grace that I may recognize Thee by Thine
> own Self, not by that which is other than Thee, and that I may behold the
> wonders of the lights of Thy Beauty by what Thou hast bestowed upon me
> through Thy bounty, not that which belongeth unto men. For Thou hast
> not created any proof for Thyself save Thine own Essence, nor any evidence
> save Thy signs. Thou, verily, are He that ariseth, the Ruler, the Knowing,
> the All-Informed. Praise be to God, Lord of all the worlds.

> Whereupon, end thou thy pilgrimage, for We have not permitted anyone
> to approach closer than this unto the sanctuary, for before that spot shine
> the lights of the Essence from behind the names and the attributes. And,
> apart from that, courtesy must be observed, for that is one of the best of
> all attributes in the sight of God, King of the earth and the heavens. Thus
> have We sent down upon thee the command with a shining and manifest
> proof. It is our desire that, from every city, one should go forth on My
> behalf and for his own sake to visit the House of God and that he may
> be a pilgrim. By God, at every step mercy and grace shall descend upon
> him from the heaven of resplendent holiness, and at the same time when
> he raises his foot for the ﬁrst step and sets it down, God shall forgive his
> sins and the sins of his mother and his father and all that are related unto
> him. Thus hath the grace of thy Lord encompassed all created things,
> whether of the ﬁrst or of the last. By God, whosoever visiteth the House,
> it is as if he hath visited God within the pavilion of the glory of meeting
> with Him and the tent of the majesty of His Beauty. Thus do We inform
thee of the call that is mighty by the side of the Throne.

Whosoever visiteth the House as We have commanded him, God shall
> raise him up after his death within the paradise of majesty and grandeur in
> such a beauteous form that the dwellers of the Concourse on High shall be
> illumined by the lights of his face, and all that are in the exalted heavens
> shall be commanded to appear before him and to circle about him and
> to make their pilgrimage unto his beauty every morning and evening. O
> trustees of God upon the earth, strive unto the most great mention, and
> cast away all that is in your hands and turn your faces unto the Abode
> of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing. Be ye steadfast, O
> people, in this station that, if all that are on earth should rise up against
> you, ye would not pay the least attention to them and would remain ﬁrm
> in the faith of God. The unbelievers shall prevent you performing what
> God has sent down upon you on account of the rancour that is in their
> breasts. But God shall do as He willeth through His word; He, verily, is
> the Powerful, the Mighty.

Know, then, that We have written concerning pilgrimage to the House

> God and the inhabitants of the Exalted Concourse love to be brief in their
> outward acts. And inwardly, let there be at all times those that perform
> the pilgrimage. Thus have We taught thee and made known unto thee the
> paths of holiness and guided thee unto the shores of manifest grace.

FOREWORD BY TRANSLATOR

> Sanctified be God! The All-Glorious Providence has
> decreed for the land of Sh[íráz] to be the dawning-place
> of light and ﬁre. That is, before God, the appearance of
> these two attributes is most prominent and most evident
> in that realm. And this is because the ﬁre of opposition
> broke forth brightly in that city before it appeared in all
other lands.

—Baháʾuʾlláh1

Background to the Narrative

> In the 1920s in Iran, Mírzá Asaduʾlláh Fádil Mázandarání, a renowned
> scholar and capable historian, undertook a massive project to compose a
> documented history of the Bábí–Baháʾí religions, which he entitled Táríkh
> Zuhúruʾl-Haqq [The History of the Appearance of the True One]—an
> eﬀort that was greatly encouraged by Shoghi Eﬀendi, the Guardian of the
> Baháʾí Faith.2 For his history, Mázandarání needed detailed accounts of
> events and occurrences during the ﬁrst century of the Baháʾí Faith. With
> the aim of gathering such data and documentation, he and others trav-
> eled extensively throughout Iran and vicinity, combing through the Baháʾí
> community for available information, such as tablets, memoirs, letters,
> pictures, narratives, poems, historical sites, and family trees. However,
> Mázandarání recognized that he needed much more information, so he
turned to Shoghi Eﬀendi for assistance.

In the latter part of 1924, Shoghi Eﬀendi began the process of recording
> the recollections of the Baháʾís who had witnessed the early years of the
> Bábí and Baháʾí Movements. Knowing that these memoirs would have a
> profound eﬀect on the understanding of future Baháʾís about the genesis of
> their religion, Shoghi Eﬀendi called for a systematic campaign to assemble

Light is a reference to the Declaration of the Báb in Shíráz. Original Tablet in Núriʾd-
Dín Collection, no. 144, dated 1 Rajab, AH 1307 [21 February 1890].

Shoghi Eﬀendi himself also participated in this enterprise, ﬁrst by producing an elegant
> edited translation of Nabíl Zarandí’s history, The Dawn-Breakers, and later by writing two
> monumental analytical histories of the Bábí–Baháʾí Faiths, respectively entitled God Passes
> By and Lawh-i Qarn [Tablet of the Century].

> such narratives. In the Haifa–ʿAkká area, companions of Baháʾuʾlláh such
> as Áqá Husayn Áshchí [broth-maker] and Áqá Abúʾl-Qásim Bághbán
> [gardener] were interviewed for what they remembered of the formative
> days of the Bábí–Baháʾí Faiths. Sometimes, as in the case of Áshchí, such
interviews happened literally on the person’s deathbed.

During the next two decades, Shoghi Eﬀendi wrote to the Baháʾís of
> Iran urging them to prepare detailed histories of each local community,
> particularly those that had a signiﬁcant Baháʾí presence from the earliest
> days. He further called upon individuals who had witnessed the unfold-
> ing of the Heroic Age (1844–1921) in the “Cradle of the Faith” (Iran)
to record their experiences in writing.

In accordance with this request, the Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʾís of
> Shíráz entrusted the task of writing a comprehensive history of the Baháʾí
> Faith in this central region to Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh Afnán, the hereditary
> custodian of the House of the Báb in Shíráz, who readily obeyed and
> wrote of what he had witnessed and the remarkable stories that he had
> heard from those associated with the founding of the Bábí–Baháʾí Faiths.
Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh notes:

> In accordance with the instructions of the Guardian of the Cause of God
> in his wondrous and blessed letter, which stated: “Each town must write a
> brief history of the Faith since the dawning of the Sun of Horizons,” the
> Spiritual Assembly [of Shíráz] entrusted this service to this unworthy ser-
> vant, Hájí Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh Afnán. Even though this ephemeral servant
> considers himself unprepared for this great enterprise, yet hopeful of the
> divine conﬁrmations of the Beloved, has committed to paper to a prescribed
> degree what he has seen or heard from reliable observers, that the sanctiﬁed
> command of the Guardian be fulﬁlled.3

Fárs and Shíráz

> The land of Fárs is a province that millennia earlier had given birth to
> two great dynasties—the Achaemenian in the sixth century BC and the
> Sassanian in the third century AD. These empires were administered by
> leaders of great insight and learning, and engendered cultivated societ-
> ies, formidable armies, great visions for humanity, and just rulers whose
> achievements were legendary and unprecedented. Indeed, the brilliance
> of their triumphs was so dazzling that the name of the region was

> extended to the entire country, and Persia—from Persis, the Greek form
> of Fárs—was born.4 Therefore, for Persians the name Fárs evokes a deep
> sense of pride and heritage. It calls to mind the past splendors associ-
> ated with that cradle of civilization, when wise rulers from their seat in
> Persepolis wielded authority over a kingdom that extended from North
> Africa to China—kings who governed with such liberty and equity that
> the authors of the Old Testament were prompted to speak most glowingly
of their benevolence.

The language of the nation, Fársí—the language of Fárs—descends lineally
> from the language that Cyrus and Darius spoke and is the language in which
> the proclamations were engraved by their command on the rock-tablets of
> Bí-sitún and Naqsh Rustam, and upon the walls and columns of Perse-
> polis. This language stirs a profound sense of spirituality and reﬁnement
> derived from the poetry of Háﬁz, voice of the invisible and the master of
> Persian lyrical poetry, and Saʿdí, the sweet-tongued poet and the author
> of the famous Gulistán, a book of sonnets called the Garden of Roses. No
> other Iranian writers to this day enjoy—not only in their own country
> but also wherever their language is cultivated—a wider celebrity or a
> greater reputation than these two poets of Shíráz. Indeed, for Iranians,
> there is no Persian language more elevated than that which they have
> learned from Háﬁz and Saʿdí, and deep in their collective consciousness
> the legacy of these two towering literary giants of Shíráz pervades modern
Iranian culture.5

Beyond the circle of Iranians, the Baháʾí world community will forever
> associate the name of Shíráz with the opening chapter of its own history,
> for it was in Shíráz that the initial emanation of the divine revelation
> for this religion broke forth from the merchant-Prophet of that city. The
> Báb, He Who is acclaimed as the “Point round Whom the realities of the
> Prophets and Messengers revolve,”6 Who styled Himself “the Primal Point
> from which have been generated all created things . . . the Countenance of
> God Whose splendor can never be obscured, the Light of God Whose
> radiance can never fade,”7 arose meteor-like over the horizon of Shíráz.

Fárs is the Arabicized version of Párs. Persia and Persian both derive from Persis, the
Hellenized form of the root word Párs. The Old Persian word was Pârsâ.

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh Afnán

> It was in the House of the Báb in Shíráz that Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh Afnán
> (1875–1951) was born and then reared by none other than Khadíjih
> Bagum, the widow of the Báb. The stories that he heard from her were the
> bittersweet stories of the Báb and the deeply devoted disciples who circled
> around the Báb in Shíráz. Khadíjih Bagum had a particular aﬃnity towards
> the young lad’s father, Áqá Mírzá Áqá Núriʾd-Dín, who, at a time when
> tribulations had most ﬁercely beset Khadíjih Bagum, was promised by the
> Báb to be the family member who would arise for her protection and sup-
> port, and who had done just that. This immense love of Khadíjih Bagum
> likewise readily embraced Núriʾd-Dín’s children, and Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh
basked in the brilliance of her attention and aﬀection.

In 1891–92 at the age of 16, Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh was fortunate to be
> able to accompany his family to the Holy Land, where he spent some
> nine months in the immediate proximity of Baháʾuʾlláh in the Mansion of
> Bahjí. Subsequently, from Egypt he remained in constant communication
> for the next decade with ʿAbduʾl-Bahá and periodically visited Him in
> ʿAkká, where as a trusted Afnán he was privy to some of the heart-wrench-
> ing scenes of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s ministry and granted a glimpse into the most
> private inner workings of the Baháʾí Faith—he witnessed the disloyalty
> of the half-brothers of ‘Abduʾl-Bahá, their corrupt ways, the consequent
> anguish of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá, ‘Abduʾl-Bahá’s eﬀorts to conceal their perversion
> and their violation of laws, and the means by which this sad news was
transmitted to the Baháʾí community.

At the turn of the century, in 1902, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá wished for Núriʾd-Dín
> and his family, including his son, Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh, to return to Shíráz
> to rebuild the House of the Báb, which had fallen into disrepair. Shortly

Mirza Habibuʾllah Afnan

Narratives of Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh Afnán

> Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh wrote two lengthy documents. The date of composition
> of the ﬁrst narrative, entitled Táríkh Amrí Fárs va Shíráz, is not known
> with any degree of precision, although it has been estimated to be in
> the 1920s or possibly in the early- to mid-1930s. The original version
> was handwritten by Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh, and the ﬁnal draft was written
> by Mírzá Abúʾl-Hasan Ansif Nayrízí. This ﬁnal copy was edited by the
> author, whose handwritten remarks are evident along various margins and
> lines throughout the manuscript; this is the version used for translation
purposes.

Of this ﬁrst narrative, unquestionably the most valuable portions are
> those on the life of the Báb in Shíráz, a city acclaimed by the young
> Prophet as the baladuʾl-amn, “the land of refuge.”8 Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh did
> not wish to write a comprehensive history of the Báb’s life, since he knew
> full well that others had already attempted such an undertaking—men

INBMC (Iranian National Baháʾí Manuscript Collection) 91:6–10, no. 3, and
> 91:13–14, no. 4. In chapter 55 of Qayyúmu’l-Asmáʾ, the Báb refers to Himself as the Gate
> of the land of refuge (Báb-i baladu’l-amn). Verse 35 of the chapter “Pillar” (rukn) of the
> same book refers to Shíráz as the baladuʾl-amn.

> like Nabíl Zarandí, surnamed Nabíl Aʿzam, who was well known to Mírzá
> Habíbuʾlláh. Rather, his objective was to tell stories of the Báb’s sublime
> life that were current among the Báb’s immediate family in Shíráz, par-
ticularly reminiscences he had heard from Khadíjih Bagum.9

The second narrative, entitled Khátirát Hayát, is the account of Mírzá
> Habíbuʾlláh’s pilgrimages to the Holy Land and his decade-long stay
> in Egypt. The exact date of the composition of this autobiography is
> unknown, but the author’s sons, Abúʾl-Qásim and Hasan Afnán, indicate
> that it was ﬁrst composed shortly after Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh’s return to
> Iran.10 Based upon the evidence in the narrative and family records, it is
> known that these notes were recopied and reorganized in the mid-1940s.11
> Of this narrative, the most important part is the author’s recollection of
> being near Baháʾuʾlláh from the middle of July 1891 until shortly after
> Naw-Rúz 1892, that is, a little more than two months prior to the passing
> of Baháʾuʾlláh. The remaining portions are singularly important, as they
> clarify many aspects of the ﬁrst decade of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ministry when
the opposition of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s half-brothers was at its height.12

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh was a well-educated man. He attended the same
> school that the Báb had attended and received tuition from one of the
> city’s ablest educators. Baháʾuʾlláh arranged for him to study with His own
> sons in the Mansion of Bahjí. Subsequently, he spent many years receiving
> daily instructions from the celebrated Mírzá Abuʾl-Fadl Gulpáygání, one
> of the most erudite Baháʾís of his generation. Therefore, the style of his
> composition is very learned and represents an important literary achieve-
> ment in its own right. It is hoped that in due course the original Persian
> of these two narratives will also be published so that students of history
> will become better acquainted with his elegant style of composition.13

Those not fully familiar with the story of the Báb may ﬁnd it helpful while reading
> this history to refer to Nabíl’s history, presented in an edited version in The Dawn-Breakers,
> and to Hasan Balyúzí’s biography, The Báb. These volumes describe many of the persons
> and incidents mentioned in this narrative, but depict them in a wider context. For an
academic treatment of the same subject, see Abbas Amanat, Resurrection and Renewal.

Private communications, summer 1985.

For example, Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh notes that ﬁfty-ﬁve years had elapsed since the
> spring of 1892 when he had met Tarazu’llah Samandari in the Holy Land, and assuming
> these years are reckoned in accordance with the lunar calendars, this then places the date
of recomposition around 1945–46.

NOTES ON THE PRESENT TRANSLATION

> In the course of this translation, every eﬀort has been exerted to stay as
> close to the original document as possible, to the degree that a literal
> rendering has often been preferred to a more stylistic one. Footnotes have
> been added to augment information, clarify obscure points, and provide a
> more detailed perspective. Occasionally, comments by the translator have
> been added to improve the clarity or continuity of the material. These
> comments are enclosed in square brackets, thus [. . .]. All comments within
> parentheses are by the author, Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh. The numbers in pointed
> brackets, < >, correspond to the Afnán family genealogy in appendix 6.
> The system of transliteration used in this monograph is consistent with
> the method used in other academic publications and varies from the
> system used in most Baháʾí publications by: (1) avoiding subdots and
> underlines (e.g., Fádil), and (2) dropping the izaﬁh connecting the ﬁrst
> name to the surname (e.g., Husayn-ʿAlí Núrí, instead of Husayn-ʿAlíy-i-
> Núrí). The page numbers of the original manuscript are indicated in
square brackets, such as [p. 10], every ﬁve pages.

The following table provides a comparison between pages of the original

xviii             notes on the present translation

> Since any single Islamic year (denoted AH) typically overlaps with two
> Christian years, where only the Islamic year of the event is known, the
> equivalent Gregorian date is given as the ﬁrst of the two years partially
covered by that Islamic year.

Typically, the original text refers to the Central Figures by such honor-
> iﬁc titles as “His Holiness” or “His blessed Person,” and these honoriﬁcs
> have been omitted for the most part. Nor does the translation reproduce
> such expressions commonly used in the Iranian literature of the Baháʾí
> Faith as, “May my life be a sacriﬁce unto His Sacred Threshold.” Many
> key individuals are often referred to by titles, such as His Holiness the
> Exalted One, a reference to the Báb; or the Blessed Perfection or the
> Blessed Beauty, expressions used for Baháʾuʾlláh; or “the exalted wife,”
> a term used to refer to Khadíjih Bagum, the widow of the Báb. These
> titles have been replaced with their more recognizable names, the Báb,
Baháʾuʾlláh, or Khadíjih Bagum.

By the time Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh wrote his narrative, many principal per-
> sonalities featured in this history had died, and the original text therefore
> often refers to them as “the late” or “the deceased.” These terms, too, have
largely been omitted.

Some details of the events recorded in Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh’s chronicle
> diﬀer from those found in Nabíl’s Narrative, the standard history of
> these events. However, given that the chronicle represents an oral tradi-
> tion within the family of the Báb, it has its own importance and must
> form part of the analysis of historians. It should be emphasized that the
> spoken words attributed to the Báb, Baháʾuʾlláh, and ʿAbduʾl-Bahá in
> these pages cannot be ascribed with scriptural authority or equated with
> their authorized Writings. No one took notes at the time those words
> were uttered, although it cannot be ruled out that some may indeed be
the very words spoken.

All renderings of the Sacred Writings from Persian and Arabic, unless
> otherwise speciﬁed, are by the present translator. If an authorized source
> (such as Gleanings) is not cited, then the renderings should be considered
> as falling in the class of provisional translations intended to convey the
> essence (mazmún) of communications by the Founders of the Bábí–Baháʾí
> Faiths. Such summary renderings are not to be confused with full autho-
> rized translation of the Baháʾí Holy Texts, which will be disseminated in
due time by the Baháʾí World Centre.

Regarding these Texts, it should be noted that three major compilations
> have been immensely helpful in locating the original Tablets quoted by
> Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh in his narratives:

CHAPTER ONE

THE CHILDHOOD AND EARLY LIFE OF THE BÁB

The Beginning of the History

The names of the paternal and maternal ancestors of the Báb are as follows: [p.2:1]

The blessed name of the Báb was Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí-Muhammad,15 son of
> Mír[zá] Muhammad-Ridá, the son of Áqá Mír[zá] Nasruʾlláh, the son of
> Áqá Mír[zá] Fathuʾlláh, the son of Áqá Mír[zá] Ibráhím.16 He was born
> into a highly regarded family of Husayní Siyyids17 to whose nobility,
> integrity, trustworthiness, piety, devotion, and detachment everyone in
> the province of Fárs would testify. Merchants by profession, they were
> all considered exemplary in integrity and purity in the entire region of
> Fárs. The mother of the Báb was Fátimih Bagum, the daughter of Hájí
> Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn, who was the son of Áqá Mírzá ʿAbid,18 the
> son of Áqá Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad. This family also ranked among the
> renowned and trustworthy merchants of Fárs.

Early Years

> His blessed birth took place on the ﬁrst night of Muharram AH 1235 [20

October 1819], in the house belonging to His mother’s paternal uncle,

> In the Qayyúmuʾl-Asmáʾ, Surih al-Qarabih [kinsmen], verse 14, the Báb reveals:
> Verily, We have named this Remembrance by two Names from the divine Self, after
> two Beloved Ones among Our servants in the heavens.

The Báb gives a slightly diﬀerent genealogy in Sahíﬁh Baynuʾl-Haramayn (The Treatise
> Between the Two Shrines): “Say: My name is Muhammad after the word ʿAlí [i.e., ʿAlí-
> Muhammad]. And the name of My father, as hath been revealed in the Book of God, is
> Ridá after Muhammad. And the name of My grandfather in the Book of God is Ibráhím
> [Abraham], and his father is named Nasruʾlláh as has been revealed in the Qurʾán (Fathuʾlláh)”
> (Browne Or. MSS F.7[9]). The ﬁnal statement is a reference to Qurʾán 61:13: “And another
> [favor will He bestow], which ye do love—help from God [Nasruʾlláh] or a speedy victory
> [Fathuʾlláh]; so give the glad tidings to the believers.” The same genealogy is given in the
Qayyúmuʾl-Asmáʾ, Surih al-Qaribih, verses 14–15.

That is, this family traced its ancestry to Imám Husayn.

Fayzí, Hadrat Nuqtih Ula, p. 64, gives his name as Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 3                                                                                        7/10/2008 3:45:04 PM

> Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí.19 The oft-recounted utterances of that exalted lady, the
mother of the Báb, were along these lines:

> From the moment of birth, it was evident that, unlike other children, He
> was not rapacious in drinking milk. Normally, He was serene and made
> no noise. During the twenty-four-hour period, He would desire milk only
> four times. While nursing he would be most gentle, and no movement was
> discerned from His mouth. Often I would become anxious and ask myself,
> “Why is this Child not like other children? Perhaps He has some illness
> that prevents His desiring milk.” Then I would console myself, saying, “If
> He really had some unknown illness, He would manifest signs of agitation
and restlessness.”

Unlike other children, He did not complain or behave in an unseemly
> manner during the weaning period. I was most thankful that now that
> the Exalted Lord had granted me this one Child, He was gentle and
> agreeable.

> Moreover, according to what trustworthy persons have reported, it was
> evident from the beginning of His childhood that He had an extraordinary
> character that excited the wonder and amazement of all, whether relatives,
[p.5] friends, or strangers, for He was unlike any other child.

Schooling

> According to Mullá Fathuʾlláh Maktab-Dár [the school-master], son of
> Mullá Mand-ʿAlí, when His blessed age had reached ﬁve years old,20

He was taken to the [quranic school of ] Shaykh ʿAbid,21 known as Shaykh

The Báb provides the date of His birth in the Sahiﬁh Baynuʾl-Haramayn: “Say O
> denizens of the Concourse! Hear the command of the Remnant of God from this Servant,
> the Exalted, the Wise. And this Servant was born, as hath been concealed in the Book of
> God, on the ﬁrst day of Muharram of the year twelve hundred and thirty-ﬁve.” Also, the
> same date can be computed precisely from His age given in His personal diary appended
> to the Azali publication of the Kitáb Panj Shaʾn (the Book of Five Modes). Other references
> to His age are to be found in the Persian Bayán 2:1 and 4:11, and the Dalaʾil Sabʿa (the
Seven Proofs).

In Persian, when someone’s age is reported as, say, ﬁve years of age, it means they
> are in their ﬁfth year of life. In English, during the whole of the ﬁfth year of life, a child
> is said to be four years old. In general, whenever age is given in Baháʾí histories translated
> from the Persian, it is necessary to subtract one to get the age in the English manner of
> reckoning. However, in the present translation, everywhere an age is provided, the original
Persian reckoning is given.

His given name was Shaykh Muhammad (d. AH 1263/AD 1847), and he is also
known as Shaykh Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín or Shaykh Muʿallim. The Báb mentioned him in the

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 4                                                                                          7/10/2008 3:45:04 PM

> Anám,22 located in Qahviyih Awlíyá,23 one of the mystic convents occupied
> by the mystics of Fárs, on the Tayr marketplace,24 near the house of His
> maternal grandfather, and His respected maternal uncle. Mullá Fathuʾlláh
> Maktab-Dár, son of Mullá Mand-ʿAlí, was the custodian of the Masjid
> Vakíl.25 Like his father, he was one of the early believers [in the Báb] and,
> because of the persecutions and harassment, became a fugitive and forced
to travel extensively.26 He related:

> When they brought His Holiness to the maktab [quranic school], I worked
> for Shaykh Anám in the Qahviyih Awlíyá, which is one of the mystic
> convents in the old neighborhood of Shíráz,27 where the school had several
> rooms with a circular portico around them. The honored Shaykh ʿAbid, a
> man of many qualities, was the schoolmaster and taught the children of
> the noblemen, the aﬄuent, the merchants, and other distinguished citizens.
> He was a tall, ever-digniﬁed man with a long beard. A follower of the late
> Shaykh Ahmad Ahsáʾí and Siyyid Kázim Rashtí, he ranked among the
leading ﬁgures and divines of Shíráz.

At that time, I served the Shaykh as the khaliﬁh (that is, the [school’s]
> principal). Those wishing for their youngster to receive tuition from him,
> had to come beforehand and meet with him in person. They would ask
> the Shaykh for a place either through a letter or through a distinguished
> intermediary. This was because the Shaykh did not accept the children of
> just anyone and was particularly reluctant to accept lads from the bazaarí
> shopkeepers, because of their ill manners and dirty clothing.

> Arabic Bayán 6:11, “Say: O Muhammad, My teacher! Do not beat Me ere My years have
gone beyond ﬁve.”

A variation of the same name, Shaykhuná, is employed in Nabíl Aʿzam, The Dawn-
Breakers, p. 75.

Named after a certain Suﬁ saint, Dervish Awlíyá (d. AH 1119/AD 1707), this convent
> is occupied by the dervishes and Suﬁs. Located in the Bazaar Murgh, it is situated near the
> house of the Báb’s maternal uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, and over the years it has decayed
so thoroughly that no trace of it is now evident.

Known also as the Bazaar Murgh [poultry market] quarter, this is one of the most
> prosperous and religiously signiﬁcant quarters of the city and one of the ﬁve Haydarí wards
of Shíráz. For further details, see Fasáʾí, Fársnámih Násirí, vol. 2, pp. 27–47.

Masjid Vakíl was the largest and most important of Shíráz’s mosques.

Mullá Fathuʾlláh and his father converted on the day the Báb proclaimed His Call in
> the aforementioned mosque. Both were among the martyrs at Shaykh Tabarsí, and therefore
his recollection of the Báb must have been conveyed to the Afnán family at an early time.

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh adds parenthetically, “And the center of this convent was inhabited,
surrounded by ruins and evidence of old graves and gravestones.”

Description of His Condition During Childhood

> In any event, one morning, I saw the honored Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-
> Ridá,28 who had been a friend of Shaykh Anám in the past, come to the
> Qahviyih [Awlíyá]. He sat next to the Shaykh and described his situation
as follows:

> “After forty years, the Exalted Lord has graced me with a Child who has
> caused me to wonder over His behavior.” The Shaykh asked him to explain
> further, but he only replied, “It is hard to say.” [The Shaykh] insisted, to
which [the father] oﬀered:

O venerable Shaykh! Which of His amazing conditions should I recount?

> Such peculiar characteristics are manifest in Him that the people are aston-
> ished. Now, when He is ﬁve years old, He sometimes raises His hands to
> the threshold of the One God, and recites prayers. He wakes in the middle
> of the night29 and stands to oﬀer His obligatory prayers, in the midst of
> which He weeps. Sometimes He is sad, on other occasions He is happy,
> or immersed in rapture, or preoccupied with the imaginary world. My
> astonishment and bewilderment prevents me from describing further. Were

present, it would make a thick book.

At such a [young] age, He tells whether an unborn child is a boy or a
girl, for the whole clan. After the birth, it is as He foretold.

And again, some time ago, together with His maternal uncle, the esteemed
> Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, we were at the bathhouse of Bazaar Murgh quarter.30
> This Child was sleeping between His uncle and me, when suddenly He
> rose and stated, ‘The vaulted roof of the Garm-Khánih [steam chamber]
> of Mírzá Hádí’s bathhouse, which was for women, has just caved in, and
> ﬁve women and one child have been [killed] under the rubble.’ His uncle
> said to Him, ʿÁqá, please sleep and refrain from saying such things. What
> manner of talk is this!’ He responded, ‘It is as I said.’ It was not long after
> that we heard a tumult of voice from the direction of the bathhouse, saying
> that Mírzá Hádí’s bathhouse was wrecked and a number of women were
> under the rubble. One person said twenty women [were killed]; another
> said thirty or forty; but later it was determined that ﬁve women and a child
> had been killed. The truth was just as He had said.

A.Q. Afnán has said that on that occasion, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, the Báb’s maternal
uncle, went to the school (private communication, August 1993).

This suggests that the Báb woke before dawn to oﬀer His ﬁrst morning prayer
> and, unlike most others, was not combining the ﬁrst and the second Muslim obligatory
prayer.

A.Q. Afnán suggests that only the Báb and His maternal uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí,
were present on that occasion (private communication, August 1993).

In another instance, a while ago He informed us, ‘Last night, I dreamt
> that a large balance was suspended in mid-air in a vast space. Imám Jaʿfar [p.10]
> Sádiq was seated on one of the plates, and, because of His weight, that
> plate was resting on the ground while the other plate was suspended in the
> air. An invisible person lifted Me and placed Me on the empty plate. My
> plate was now heavier than the other, and I came to the ground and the
> ﬁrst dish rose into the air.’ I said to Him, ‘Alas, Child, how bizarre! Do
not talk like that.’

What should I say! There are so many astonishing stories about Him that
> I cannot tell. At one time, Áqá Mírzá Siyyid Hasan31 suggested that this
> Child might be under the spell of jinn or fairies, and he said that we should
> take Him to those knowledgeable in such matters and request protective
> prayers for Him. Even though I do not believe that such things are true
> and trustworthy, in the light of his [Siyyid Hasan’s] comment I brought Áqá
> Muhammad-Hasan, the Munajjim [astrologer], to the house and described
> for him the details. He made some calculations and said, ‘He is protected
> from the malevolence of jinn and fairies, and he has not suﬀered any harm
> from sprites.’ Then he asked for His birthdate. Thereupon, he wrote certain
> protective charms and prayers and gave them [to us], recited some mysteri-
> ous verses and, having learned of His birthdate, he left. After the departure
> of Áqá Muhammad-Hasan, the Child tore up the talismans, the writings he
> had left, and the sheet of instructions he had given [us], and tossed them
> out, saying to me, ‘In the words of the mystic: You make a great show of
assistance, but I am that assistance.’32

In short, for some time I have been consumed with the diﬃculties of
> this Child, and I do not know which of His conditions I should describe
> to you. It is now time for His education and training, and I wish Him to
receive His tuition and religious training from you.

I was most astounded by the descriptions of the venerable Mírzá [Muham-
> mad-Ridá], and the Shaykh was astonished as well. It was decided that at
> an agreeable time on [the following] Thursday morning the Child would
be brought to the school.

On the promised morning, the Child arrived followed by a servant33

> carrying a small [copper-tray] ﬁlled with sweets and a student’s version
> of the Qurʾán, which is customary for the new pupil to read from in the
schools in Shíráz.

Because of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Ridá’s descriptions of Him, the Shaykh,
> several of the students who had reached the age of maturity, and I were
> thoroughly enthralled in watching Him. He came in, greeted [everyone],

> Siyyid ʿAlí, arrived as well and sat next to the Shaykh. After the exchange

> All-Knowing!” The Shaykh was deeply enraged and picked up his stick and
> said to Him, “Do not utter such things here!” His Holiness commenced
> reading, and His maternal uncle smiled and ordered certain arrangements
> and then left.35

> The late Áqá Muhammad Ibráhím Ismáʿíl Beg, who was a well-known,
trusted, and respected merchant, related:

> I was twelve years old at that time, and on that day Siyyid-i Báb came and
> sat between me and Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Ridá Mustawfí who was about
> the same age as I. In fact, He [the Báb] kneeled, in a reﬁned way. His head
> was bowed over the student Qurʾán, but He did not read a word, so I asked,
> “Why are You not reading the lesson [aloud] like the other children?” He
[p.15]            made no reply; however, two other lads sitting near us were heard reading
poems from Háﬁz aloud, and they came to this verse:
From Heaven’s heights the birdsong calls to you

in sorrow that you’re trapped in walls of clay.
He turned quickly to me and said, “That is your answer.” I replied,
“Well done.”36
Similarly, it is related:

> Since Shaykh Anám was a learned man and a follower of Shaykh Ahmad
> [Ahsáʾí], each morning he conducted a seminary session in Qahviyih Awlíyá
> where several of his [theological] students would gather to engage him in
> discussions and debates. One day a scientiﬁc topic was being discussed, and
> after considerable debate it remained unresolved, since it was particularly
> complex. The venerable Shaykh stated, “Tonight I will study the [authorita-
> tive] books on this topic, and tomorrow we will discuss the matter again
> and solve it completely.” At this point, the exchange was concluded.

Qurʾán 34:25.

Nabíl Aʿzam, The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 75–76, tells a similar story, though consider-
ably diﬀerent in details.

Suddenly the young Pupil [who had been listening] raised His blessed
> head and with sound reasoning, irrefutable proof, and scientiﬁc evidence,
> propounded the answer they sought and removed all complexities. They
> were wonder-struck and amazed. The [seminarian] students informed the
> Shaykh that they had no recollection of ever having discussed that topic

> He had gained this knowledge. The Pupil smiled and oﬀered this couplet
from Háﬁz:
Should the Holy Spirit’s grace again assist,

Others too will do what Christ has done.37

> In all events, during those tender years, many such manifestations of
> extraordinary and innate qualities were observed in Him and are testiﬁed
to by both friends and foes, and are beyond my abilities to describe.38

His father, Áqá Mír[zá] Muhammad-Ridá, passed away when the Báb
> was only nine years old,39 and from then on He was reared in the bosom
> of His maternal uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí. This uncle had witnessed

The Testimony of the Khál Aʿzam

> My paternal grandmother, [Zahrá Bagum], who was a paternal cousin of
> the Báb’s mother, related that she had personally heard the uncle [Hájí
> Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí] discussing [the claim of the Báb] with his younger

See Balyúzí, The Báb, p. 35. For similar childhood stories of the Báb, see Nabíl
Aʿzam, The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 75–76.

The Báb in the Qayyúmuʾl-Asmáʾ, Surih al-Sina, verse 5, addressing Himself states,
> “And We favored Thee during Thy Childhood with the mighty Cause of God, as it had
> been decreed as such in the Mother Book.” In the same Book, Surih al-Ism, verse 34,
> the Báb proclaims, “Verily, as a child I was aware of the truth of My own Self, and God
is the Almighty, the All-knowing.”

In the Qayyúmuʾl-Asmáʾ, Surih al-Jihad, verse 39, the Báb states, “O My God, My
> Lord! Verily, in accordance with Thy will, My father passed away, and I do not remember
> Him. My Master, when he is seated with the heavenly angels, inform him of My Cause
> and record him in this Mighty Book.”

He then continued:

> Have you forgotten our journey to Sabz-Púshán40 when He was a child aged
> nine years old? There was a group of us, and He came along as well. When
> we arrived, being completely exhausted, we performed our ablutions, oﬀered
[p.20]         our late afternoon and the evening obligatory prayers, paid our homage of

> visitation, ate dinner, and went to bed. It was not long after, at midnight,
> that I awoke and noticed that He was not in bed. Deeply perturbed, I was
> overtaken with anxiety that perhaps He had fallen from the mountain.
> Finally, after searching extensively, I heard a voice raised in the obligatory
> prayer and prayers of gloriﬁcation to the Lord, coming from the lower
> extremities [of the mountain]. When I followed the melody of that chant,
> I found the Child, standing alone and in private, in consummate rapture
> voicing prayers and supplications to the One Who transcends all mention,
> on the deserted mountainside and at that late hour of the night. My beloved
> brother, I ask: After observing such things, is there any room for doubt?
> With a knowledge born of certainty, with truth that stands most manifest,

In short, our grandmother often spoke to us on this theme.

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh added parenthetically, “Located in the mountains south of Shíráz,
> the shrine of Sabz-Púshán is about twelve kilometers from the city. The route to that place
> is most diﬃcult, and even strong individuals are exhausted by the journey. People often visit
> that spot in the summer.”

CHAPTER TWO

COMMERCE AND MARRIAGE

Commerce

> When the Báb had reached the age of ﬁfteen, He joined the commercial [p.21:4]
> oﬃce of His uncle, [Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí], in Shíráz.41 He remained
> for a short while in Shíráz and then moved to the port city of Búshihr.
> In that city, His oﬃce was in the Mínandí caravansary. Although it was
> before the declaration of His Cause, the many signs and e vidences of
> His sanctity and the wondrous verses that ﬂowed from His blessed pen
would attract the envy and the jealousy of men of learning.42

One day in Egypt during the time when the illustrious Abúʾl-Fadl was
> occupied with writing the Kitáb-i Faráʾíd, we came to talk about the early
> years of the Báb prior to His declaration and the period when He was
engaged in trading. Mírzá Abúʾl-Fadl related the following to me:
I myself heard Hájí Siyyid Javád known as Karbaláʾí relate that

> when His Holiness [the Báb] was active as a merchant in Búshihr, because
> of my friendship and close association with His maternal uncles, I used
> to stay with them whenever I visited either Shíráz or Búshihr. One day
> Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad, a maternal uncle [of the Báb], came to
> me with a request, “Give some good counsel to my Nephew. Tell Him
> not to write or speak about certain studies that can only provoke the
> jealousy of certain people. These people cannot tolerate seeing a young
> merchant of little schooling demonstrate such scientiﬁc erudition and
> therefore become envious and resentful.” He was very insistent that I
> should counsel Him [to desist from such activities], but in the end I
> replied with this verse:

A.Q. Afnán suggests that based on extensive family correspondence examined by
> him, the Báb began to work in His uncle’s oﬃce at the age of ten, and it was at the age
> of ﬁfteen—the age of maturity in Islamic law—that He moved to Búshihr (private com-
> munications, August 1992). The same information is provided by the Báb Himself in the
> Kitáb Fihrist, “After My childhood had passed, by the will of God, I began the occupation
of commerce as this was decreed by God, and I commenced this from the age of ten.”

Nicolas, Seyyed Ali Mohammad dit le Bab, p. 189, n. 131, on the authority of Hájí
> Mírzá Jání of Kashan, whom Nicolas assumed to be the author of the Kitáb-i Nuqtatuʾl-
> Kaf, suggests that at the age of eighteen the Báb revealed Risálih Fiqihiyyih.

> The luster of the fair of face cannot be veiled,
> Shut him in and out of eyelet will he show his visage.

> and added: “We are earthbound and He is celestial. Our counsel is no
> use to Him.”43

> In Búshihr He engaged in commerce for six years44 and associated with
> all strata of society, including the ʿulamá, the merchants, and the shop-
> keepers, and dealt with all in such wise that they were very satisﬁed and
> grateful in every respect. In every gathering and assembly, men praised
His splendid qualities.

During one of my journeys to the sacred presence of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá,
> He spoke one day about the time the Báb stayed [in Búshihr] and of his
commercial activities. He stated:

> During His stay in Búshihr, the Báb achieved extraordinary things and
> thoroughly demolished the foundation of people’s corrupt practices. The
> merchants of Búshihr had a custom that after a deal had been concluded
> they would renege and barter to receive a considerable discount. Some of
> them came to His Holiness, negotiated purchase of indigo dye, and bought
> a very large quantity. After they had sealed the bargain and moved the lots
> of indigo to their own oﬃce, they returned to renege and bargain. His
[p.25]             Holiness did not accept and said, “You made a bargain, signed papers, and

> the transaction has been completed. I will not give a discount and will not
> renegotiate.” They insisted. He replied, “What I said is ﬁnal.” They pleaded,
> “It is the custom of the country.” He responded, “Many of these customs
> are wrong and will soon be abolished.” No matter how much they insisted,
> He would not agree. The merchants were obstinate, and at last He said,
> “[If ] the price is high, return the merchandise as I will not barter.” They
> insisted, “It is the custom here.” He replied, “I wish to put an end to this
> custom.” They insisted, “If a merchant has bought commodities and moved
> them to his warehouse, and then returns them, he will forfeit his standing
> with merchants.” “It is your choice,” He told them, “accept the terms and
> refrain from re-negotiation.” Again they insisted, “But this is the custom of
> the realm.” Yet again, He reminded them, “I am ending this custom.”
ʿAbduʾl-Bahá continued relating:

> Eventually, He [the Báb] ordered the merchandise brought back to His shop
> and did not yield to their eﬀorts at bargaining. He changed many of their
> unseemly practices during the period He was a merchant in Búshihr.

> A similar translation appears in Balyúzí, The Báb, pp. 39–40.

The Báb indicates He was in Búshihr for ﬁve years; see Selections from the Writings of
the Báb, pp. 180–81.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 12                                                                                      7/10/2008 3:45:05 PM

commerce and marriage                                     13

Soon thereafter, one of His maternal uncles arrived at Búshihr, and the
> same merchants who had returned the indigo dye came to see the uncle and
> complained about His behavior, saying, “He has ruined our reputation. We
> had a deal on dyes, however, as customary, we wished to renegotiate, but
> He did not comply. He arranged for the goods to be brought back from
> our store. This is a great insult to us as merchants. You should counsel Him
not to repeat such oﬀenses.”

The maternal uncle approached the Báb advising Him, “Why do You
> refuse to yield to people’s wishes and disrupt the established customs of
> the realm?” He told him, “Even now, if they should wish to bargain after
> a transaction is completed, I would refuse again.”
> That was a very blissful day. ʿAbduʾl-Bahá smiled unceasingly and repeated
> several times, “Prior to His declaration, the Báb announced that He would
change many of the accepted ways.”

In short, after six years’ residence in Búshihr, [the Báb] wrote several
> times to His uncles, “I plan to visit the ʿAtabát.45 One of you should come
> to Búshihr and take over the business so I can commence my journey
> to the ʿAtabát.” The uncles procrastinated and did not comply with His
> wish. When the time for His departure arrived, He settled His accounts
> with everyone, prepared a detailed ledger, sealed the books, and left them
> in the oﬃce. He then sealed the entrance to the oﬃce and entrusted the
> key to the custodian of that building with the instructions that whichever
> of His maternal uncles should arrive ﬁrst from Shíráz to Búshihr should
> be allowed to enter. Thereupon, He wrote to Shíráz “Though I wrote you
> repeatedly asking that one of you come to Búshihr as I have a journey to
> the ʿAtabát in mind, you have not come. Therefore, I have sealed the door
> of the shop and entrusted the key to the custodian and have left for the
ʿAtabát.”46 So, after six years in Búshihr, He left for the ʿAtabát.

Once His blessed letter was received in Shíráz, [His eldest maternal
> uncle,] Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad became deeply worried and per-
> turbed, complaining, “What manner of conduct is this? Our good name in
> the commercial community will be ruined, and the chain of our business
> transactions will be broken! What will happen to our accounts with the
> people?” To this, the illustrious uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, responded,

The ʿAtabát is a general term referring to the region where Najaf, Karbalá, Kázimayn,
> and Sámarrá are located. The ﬁrst of the two cities hold within them the Shrines of Imám
> ʿAlí and Imám Husayn, respectively. Kázimayn is famous because the Shrines of the seventh
> and the ninth Imáms are located there. Sámarrá is where the Shrines of the tenth and the
eleventh Imáms, ʿAlí an-Naqi and Hasan al-ʿAskarí, are situated.

Mírzá Abúʾl-Fadl, Táríkh Zuhúr Díyánt Hadrat Báb va Hadrat Baháʾuʾlláh, gives the
date of Báb’s departure as 1 Rabíʿuʾl-Avval AH 1257 [23 April 1841].

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 13                                                                                    7/10/2008 3:45:05 PM

> “Rest assured! I know Him, and our Nephew does not do anything wrong.
[I am certain that] He has arranged people’s accounts before leaving.”

The uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad, set out for Búshihr.47 Upon
> his arrival, he secured the key from the custodian of the caravansary,
> noted the seal on the door of the room, opened the door, and began a
> careful examination of the books. He found that the accounts relating to
> every person were most satisfactory and accurate. Relieved, he wrote to
[p.30] his brothers, “the accounts and record books are in order” and expressed

praise and gratitude for their Nephew.48

In the ʿAtabát

> The Báb arrived at the ʿAtabát. His blessed stay in the ʿAtabát is an exten-
> sive story, but it will be related here brieﬂy, as our attention is focused
on events in Fárs.

One day Mullá Husayn, who at that time was engaged in studies in
> the ʿAtabát under the tutelage of Siyyid [Kázim Rashtí], saw His Holiness
> [the Báb] while He was standing in prayer at the sanctuary of the Shrine
> of the Prince of Martyrs.49 He saw a young Siyyid, aged twenty-two,
> oﬀering His supplications with an intense humility and rapture that was
> not to be observed previously among any of the ʿulamá, the mystics, or
> the pilgrims [to that sacred Shrine]. He was carried away with petitioning
> God and performing the rites of pilgrimage. Mullá Husayn was astounded
> and attracted by his beauty and perfection. He approached [the Báb] and
> greeted Him. However, wrapped in devotions, His Holiness did not reply.
> Mullá Husayn moved to the back and waited there. Having completed
> the pilgrimage prayers in the inner sanctuary, [the Báb] went out to the
> courtyard, and to Mullá Husayn’s utter astonishment, repeated the pil-
grimage prayers there.

Once more, Mullá Husayn approached and greeted Him. Being occu-
> pied with His prayers, [the Báb] did not respond, which further deepened
> the Akhúnd’s wonder.50

> A.Q. Afnán suggests that it was the younger uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, who went

on Búshihr. (Private communications, Nov. 1992).

For a brief description of the Báb’s stay in Búshihr, see Nabíl Aʿzam, The Dawn-
Breakers, pp. 77–80.

A reference to Imám Husayn.

Mullá Husayn is referred to as ʿAkhúnd’, meaning a lower-level divine who serves the
people, somewhat analogous to a parish priest or a teacher of divinity at a school. The term

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 14                                                                                       7/10/2008 3:45:06 PM

commerce and marriage                                       15

When [the Báb] had completed the pilgrimage prayers, He moved
> outside from the courtyard. The Akhúnd [Mullá Husayn] approached
> Him and greeted Him. This time, [the Báb] returned his greeting and
> apologized, “Twice you have showed your courtesy, but absorbed and
> transported in the rites of pilgrimage, concentrating only on the exalted
> Shrine of the Imám—upon Him be peace—I did not respond. For this,
> I wish to apologize. Whosoever attains that sacred ground must forget
> himself and all worldly matters. As such, I had become oblivious of My
> own Self and overcome with other conditions. Once more, I apologize
to you.”51

Hearing such a speech only served to enhance the amazement of the
> Akhúnd, as he had never thought that a young merchant could manifest
> such extraordinary depth of humility, reverence, piety, and veneration. It
> was unusual and contrary to the fashionable neglect of religion. Therefore,

The Akhúnd reported with great care the details of what had transpired
to Siyyid [Kázim] who had smiled and recited this verse:

On the morning of the appointed Friday, [the Báb] made his promised
> visit to the home of the Siyyid where the latter was occupied with preach-
> ing from the pulpit and the house was ﬁlled to capacity with worshippers.
> Finding no seat available, His Holiness [the Báb] sat at the threshold.
> On seeing His countenance, the late Siyyid said no more, preferring pure
> silence. All those present were astonished. After a quarter of an hour, he
> resumed an oration regarding the signs of the manifestation of the Prom-
[p.35] ised One. He said, “Behold, He is manifest as the sun”. With these words

> he concluded his arguments and descended the pulpit.53 It was at this
> moment that with the utmost reverence Akhúnd Mullá Husayn approached
His Holiness [the Báb] and led Him to a seat next to the Siyyid.

Were I to detail the sojourn of the Báb in the ʿAtabát and the events
> that transpired there and the glad tidings imparted by the late Siyyid, it
> would be like a Qurʾán commentary or a thick book of history. But our
> purpose is to outline the events in Fárs.

Return from the ʿAtabát

> After six months of His blessed stay in the ʿAtabát had passed, His mother,
> longing to see her only Oﬀspring, earnestly petitioned her brother, Hájí
> Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, to proceed for the ʿAtabát and to bring His Holiness
> to Shíráz—a matter that she greatly insisted upon. Deeply devoted to his
> sister and Nephew, the illustrious uncle agreed and proceeded at once to
the ʿAtabát.

On meeting His Holiness, he stated, “I have come to accompany you
> in Your return to Shíráz.” [The Báb] refused. However much the uncle
> insisted, He refused, stating, “I intend to remain in the ʿAtabát for some
time.”

Because his sister was looking forward to His Holiness’s arrival in Shíráz,
> the uncle did not defer to this refusal. Through a message transmitted by
> Hájí Siyyid Javád Karbaláʾí, he appealed to the Siyyid [Kázim] to convince
His Holiness to return to Shíráz.

One day, the uncle himself went to the home of the Siyyid [Kázim] and
> explained the situation as follows: “My Nephew lived in Búshihr for six
> years before coming to the ʿAtabát. His mother has no other child beside
> Him and deeply longs to see Him and plans to arrange for His marriage.

See Nabíl Aʿzam, The Dawn-Breakers, p. 27, where Nabíl outlines slightly diﬀerent
recollections of that day from Shaykh Hasan Zunúzí.

> He has not consented to what I say, in bidding Him return to Shíráz.
> Therefore, I beg of you to speak with Him, that He may accompany me
> to Shíráz.” At ﬁrst, the Siyyid replied, “Is it up to us to interfere? Allow
> us the beneﬁt of His presence for a while longer.” The illustrious uncle
> responded, “As His mother is anticipating His arrival and her approval is
important as well, kindly tell Him to agree to return to Shíráz.”

Eventually, the Siyyid transmitted the message to His Holiness [the
> Báb], saying, “If it pleases You, return to Shíráz.” Because it was the wish
> of the Siyyid, His Holiness agreed. In the company of His uncle, He set
> out for Shíráz.54

Marriage

> There He rejoined His mother and relatives. After several months He
> expressed the desire to return to the ʿAtabát. Hearing that His Holi-
> ness entertained such considerations caused His mother to grow deeply
> anxious, and with great urgency she spoke with her brother, Hájí Mírzá
> Siyyid ʿAlí, about His marriage. Having spoken with the illustrious con-
> sort, Khadíjih-Sultán Bagum, daughter of the late Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí and a
> paternal cousin of the Báb’s mother, the arrangements for the wedding

The following is noted in Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, pp. 132–33, on the authority of
Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúruʾl-Haqq, volume 3:

> Because of the insistence of the mother of the Báb and other kinsmen as well as his
> own profound desire, Hájí Mír[zá] Siyyid ʿAlí, the Khál, had come to Karbalá. One
> day the Báb met Mullá Sádiq [Khurásání] in the courtyard of the Shrine of Imám
> Husayn. The Báb said to him, “My uncle has recently arrived from Shíráz, and if you
> wish to meet him, come to our abode.” The Akhúnd expressed his deep interest and
> with thanks assured Him he would come. That very afternoon he went to the home
> of the Báb where a great many of the ʿulamá, merchants, and other dignitaries were
> present, with the Khál sitting and conversing with the guests, and the Báb serving
> tea and sherbet. Mullá Sádiq spoke of the Báb’s peerless qualities and His exalted
> character. In response, the Khál said, “Even though our entire family is well known
> in Shíráz and its vicinity for our pious nature and goodly characters, yet this Youth
> shines like a most brilliant candle in our midst, and it is most evident that He is
> cut from a diﬀerent cloth. Our one wish is for Him to undertake study of divers
> sciences so it would bring added honor to us. However, He refuses.” Mullá Sádiq
> responded, “If you do not take Him with you to Shíráz, I will see to it that He is
> engaged in studying.” Thrilled at the prospect, the Khál stated, “Even though it is
> very agonizing for His mother and other kinsmen to be far from Him, yet because of
> your assurance, I will return by myself to Shíráz.” A few days later, the Khál returned
> to his native city and left the Báb in Karbalá. However, it was not long thereafter
> that He, too, returned to Shíráz.

> of Rajab AH 1258 [25 August 1842] in the presence of an assemblage of
the merchants, the noblemen, and the ʿulamá of Fárs.56

And since the appointed time for His Manifestation was near, He did
> not travel anywhere, but prayers and verses in Arabic and expositions on
> [divine] sciences continually ﬂowed from His pen.

Ahmad, the Báb’s Son

> After a year, that is in AH 1259 [1843], God granted Him a son who
> died at birth. Before his birth, [the Báb] had prophesied, “The child is a
> boy named Ahmad, but it is not his destiny to live.” The child was buried
> in the Bíbí Dukhtarán cemetery of Shíráz.57 My paternal grandmother,
> [Zahrá Bagum], who was the sister of Khadíjih Bagum, related for me
> the details surrounding the child’s birth:
[p.40]        The delivery of the child was very diﬃcult, to the point that several times

> we lost all hope for the mother’s recovery. During the ﬁnal surge of the
> labor pains, the mother of His Holiness went to Him. He asked her, “Has
> she delivered?” to which she responded negatively. [The Báb] then took a
> small mirror that lay by His side, penned a prayer and a talisman on the
> face of the mirror, gave it to His mother, [saying that she should] take it
> to His wife and hold it before her face. She took the mirror and held it
> before [Khadíjih Bagum]. As her gaze fell upon the mirror, instantly the
> lifeless child was delivered, and the mother recovered.58

As customary on such occasions, the wedding consisted of two separate celebrations,
> one for the men and the other for the women. The men gathered in the house of the
> Báb’s uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, while the women gathered in the residence of Khadíjih
> Bagum’s father, which house was next door. The wedding was conducted by Shaykh Abú-
Turáb, the Imám-Jumʿih (A.Q. Afnán, private communications, August 1992).

A copy of the Báb’s marriage certiﬁcate provides the same date, see Balyúzí, The
> Báb page opposite 80, and Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, pp. 158–61. The Báb refers to His
> wedding as follows: “O concourse of Light! Hear My call from the point of Fire in this
> ocean of snow-white water on this crimson earth. Verily, I am God, besides Whom there
> is no other God. On the exalted throne a beloved noble woman, bearing the same name
> [Khadíjih] as the beloved of the First Friend [the Prophet Muhammad], was wedded to
> this Great Remembrance; and verily, I caused the angels of Heaven and the denizens of
> Paradise, on the day of the Covenant, to bear witness, in truth, to God’s Remembrance”
> (The Báb, Qayyúmuʾl-Asmaʾ, Surih of Qarábat [The Chapter of Kinship], quoted in Fayzí,
Khándán Afnán, pp. 7–8).

Thus named since the tomb of Bíbí Dukhtarán is located there. For further details,
consult Fasaʾi, Fársnámih Násirí, vol. 2, p. 1131.

The following passage from The Báb, Qayyúmuʾl-Asmáʾ, Surih Qarábih, is addressed to
Khadíjih Bagum (cited in Balyúzí, Khadíjih Bagum, pp. 8–9, edited slightly below): “O well-

The Báb’s mother then returned to His presence and remonstrated with

> You not perform this act sooner and preserve the life of the child?” He
> smiled and replied, “It is not My destiny to leave any progeny.” His mother
> was infuriated with this comment but said no more.59
The wife of the Báb recounted for me:

> One night I dreamt that there was a fearsome male lion in the courtyard.
> My hands were around the neck of the lion. The beast dragged me around
> the courtyard two and a half times. I woke up, profoundly alarmed and
> trembling with fright. His Holiness asked me the cause of my agitation, and
> I told him what I had dreamt. His comment was: “You awoke too soon, as

> and-a-half years.” And what He said, transpired.

> God, the Most Great. Suﬃcient unto thee is this glory, which cometh unto thee from God,

> the Sublime, in the sanctiﬁed Paradise.” Also, see Balyúzí, Khadíjih Bagum, p. 9, for another
mention by the Báb of his son Ahmad, in Suratuʾl-ʿAbd of the Qayyúmuʾl-Asmáʾ.

See Nabíl Aʿzam, The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 76–77, for a brief reference to this incident
and a purported prayer by the Báb marking the passing of His son.

CHAPTER THREE

THE BURNING BUSH

[p.41:10] It proceeded thus until ﬁnally the declaration of the Báb took place on the

> eve of Friday, the ﬁfth day of Jamádíyuʾl-Avval AH 1260 [23 May 1844],
> two hours and eleven minutes into the night.60 There is a magniﬁcent story
of these wonderful events related by the wife of the Báb as follows:

> The practice of His Holiness was that each day He would return home
> about an hour after the sunset and commence devotions, the chanting of
> the names of God, and writing. About three hours into the night He would
> have the evening meal and would retire about four hours past sunset. In
> the morning, He would rise one hour before the dawn and, after washing,
> would perform His ablutions and then proceed to the upper chambers of
> the House, which had been set aside as His formal guestroom and formed
> an outer apartment. There, He stood to recite tablets of visitation, prayers,
> supplications, and to repeat the names of God. When the sun had risen,
> Fiddih61 would ﬁre up the samovar and prepare the tea in the chamber
> occupied by His mother. His Holiness would come down to that apartment
> and have the morning tea. After that, He would proceed to His merchant
oﬃce to engage in His own business.

However, one night, unlike other nights, He came home at dusk, saying,
> “Tell Fiddih to prepare whatever we are having for the evening meal sooner
> than usual. Tonight I have a particular task to attend to.” About an hour
> and a half into the night, the dinner was served, and He joined us for this
> purpose. Afterwards, Fiddih brought water for Him to wash His blessed
> hands, and, as usual in the evenings, she spread our bedding and retired to
her own quarters. His Holiness retired for the night.

It was not long after that I saw Him rise from the bed and leave the room,
> going to the outer courtyard. At ﬁrst, I thought He had gone to the lavatory.
> When considerable time had passed and He did not return, I was seized by
> apprehension. I rose from my bed and left the apartment. I looked in the
> lavatory but did not see Him. Checking the street door, I found it locked
> from within. I looked in the chamber of His mother and did not ﬁnd Him
> there either. By then I was deeply bewildered and perplexed. I walked to the
> western part of the house and looked up towards the upper chamber, situated
> on the eastern wing of the House and serving as His private quarters, and

> The exact time and date of the Báb’s declaration is given in the Persian Bayán 2:7.

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh adds parenthetically: Fiddih and Mubárak were two Black servants
purchased in Búshihr during His days of commerce.

> saw that it was well lighted. It seemed as if a thousand lamps illumined the
> room. This added to my surprise, because there were no guests to require
> so many lamps. Therefore, full of astonishment, I went up the steps to the
> room. When I entered, I found that the room was so brilliantly lit that it
dazzled my eyes, although there was only a single lamp.

I saw His Holiness standing, facing the Qiblih; His hands raised heaven- [p.45]
> wards, intoning a prayer. As soon as my gaze fell upon His blessed Being, I
> beheld such majesty and resplendence as is beyond my powers to explain.
> Suddenly, such awe and trepidation enveloped me that I stood transﬁxed
> where I was, trembling uncontrollably like a leaf. I could neither retrace my
> steps nor stand. I was close to losing consciousness. All kinds of perplexities
> enveloped me. Suddenly He made a gesture with His blessed hand, telling
> me to go back. This movement of His sanctiﬁed hands released me from that
> state, and I returned to the apartment and bed. But I could not sleep, and I
> remained deeply disturbed. Every detail of the image of His blessed Person
> and that scene [in the upper chamber] added to my consternation. I felt
> like a wrongdoer who has fallen short and awaits the all-powerful sovereign
> to pass sentence on her. I did not sleep that night, until the muʾadhdhin’s62
call to morning prayers sounded from the mosque adjacent to the house.

After the adhán [call to prayer] He came downstairs. As soon as my eyes
> alighted on His blessed Countenance, I was seized by awe and perplexity.
> He no longer seemed like the Person with whom I had lived for two and
> a half years. I did not have the courage to utter a word. In any case, the
> sun was rising and I rose, carried out my ablutions, and performed the
obligatory prayer.

In accordance with our daily routine, our servant, Fiddih, had prepared
> the samovar and tea in the room of His mother and informed us that the tea
> was ready. Accompanied by Him, I proceeded there. In His mother’s room,
> He drank some tea. Each moment added to my perplexity and conjecturing.
> With His blessed hand He poured a cup of tea, passed it to me, and with
> a heavenly smile said, “What is it that troubles you? You are distraught.” I
> drank the tea, which eased my perturbation and anxiety to some extent. I
> said, “Áqá, what exalted state was it that I witnessed in Your chamber last
> night?” He replied, “At what an extraordinary time you arrived! That was
> untimely. But it was the will of God that you should see it with your own
> eyes. Know and be certain that at that very moment the One Exalted God
> appointed Me for the guidance of these servants. I am that Promised One
> whose advent they have been expecting. For the past twelve hundred and
> sixty years they have perpetually beseeched the Almighty for His appearance.

I am the one appointed for the salvation of the people.”

Each mosque has one or more muʾadhdhin who announce the time for the obliga-
tory worship (salát).

As soon as I heard Him speak these words, I kissed His knees and became
> a believer in Him. In prostration, I raised my voice in gratitude to the Lord
> for having enabled me to recognize Him.63

> It was thus that the ﬁrst woman to believe in Him was the illustrious wife
> of the Báb, [Khadíjih Bagum], and among the men of this family [the
> Afnán], it was the martyred uncle, [Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí,] and among
> the ʿulamá it was Akhúnd Mullá Husayn Bushrúʾí, the Bábuʾl-Báb, whose
> story will be recounted next.

The Evidence Presented to Akhúnd Mullá Husayn in Shíráz

and How He Attained [Faith]64

> After the passing of Siyyid [Kázim Rashtí], who was a harbinger of this
> blessed Manifestation, the Akhúnd [Mullá Husayn] was aﬄicted with great
> perturbation and restlessness. Together with a group of fellow-students,
> who numbered more than forty, he undertook a period of meditation. The
> group included Áqá Mírzá [Siyyid] Muhammad-ʿAlí Barfurúshí,65 Mullá
> ʿAlí Bastámí, Akhúnd Mullá ʿAbduʾl-Jalíl Khúʾí, Mírzá ʿAbduʾl-Hádí, Mírzá
> Muhammad-Hádí, Áqá Siyyid Hasan Yazdí, Mullá Hasan Bajistání, Mullá
> Bashír, Mullá Báqir Turk, and Mullá Ahmad Abdal—all of them learned
> men who were expecting the manifestation of the Promised One. Details
> related to each one of them are captured in the historical narratives, and
our intention is only to recount the events of Fárs.

After a period of forty days of ascetic observance in the Masjid Kuﬁh
and Masjid Sahlih, the Akhúnd [Mullá Husayn] established a pact with

See Balyúzí, Khadíjih Bagum, pp. 10–13, for a diﬀerent rendering. In Kitáb Fihrist,
> the Báb states that the ﬁrst descent of Spirit on Him was on 15th of the third month
> of AH 1260 [3 April 1844]. From this it is possible to infer that the event described by
Khadíjih Bagum occurred on that date.

The section pertaining to Mullá Husayn correlates closely with the narrative of Siyyid
> Husayn Hamadání (see Táríkh-i Jadíd, pp. 35–39), which is purported to be based on
> recollections of Mírzá ʿAbduʾl-Wahháb Khurásání from utterances of Mullá Husayn and
> captured in the history of Hájí Mírzá Jání of Káshán. The present translator has not been
> able to determine if a copy of Mírzá Jání’s valuable history was in the possession of the
> early Afnán family. However, it is known that Mírzá Jání’s original text, which is about 80
> or pages long, is extant and is in the possession of a non-Baháʾí in Tihrán. Although he did
> not allow his precious manuscript to be copied, because of his longstanding friendship with
> Fádil Mázandarání he permitted the latter to examine this document, and he certiﬁed its
> authenticity. See Nabíl Aʿzam, The Dawn-Breakers, pp. 52–66, for Nabíl’s moving, though
very diﬀerent, description of the Báb’s declaration.

Quddús had returned to his native town some months prior to Siyyid Kázim’s passing;

> his companions that if any one of them should hear the Call of the Truth,
> he would inform the others at once. Feeling himself drawn towards Shíráz,
he set out.

Because he had been acquainted with His Holiness [the Báb] during
> His time in the ʿAtabát, when he arrived in Shíráz he desired a meeting [p.50]
> and inquired where His Holiness lived. He wished to pass the few days
> he would remain in Shíráz in His home. [Locating the Báb’s House], he
> knocked at the door, and His Holiness Himself came and opened the
> door. He warmly greeted and welcomed the Akhúnd, and expressed great
> kindness and aﬀection. Together they proceeded to the upper room that
> served as the guestroom. [The Báb] said, “All day I have felt disinclined
to go to the caravansary.66 Evidently this was because of your arrival.”

After they had exchanged the customary inquiries and pleasantries, tea
> was served, and the Host enjoyed it with the Akhúnd [Mullá Husayn].
> After showing him the courtesies due to a guest, the Host asked about
> the teachings and doctrines, the station and character of Shaykh [Ahmad]
> and Siyyid [Kázim]. Mullá Husayn replied, “Whatever the topic under
> discussion, their whole focus was the Traditions and sayings based on the
> glad tidings of the manifestation of the Promised One.” The Báb then
> asked, “You, the Shaykhís, have an essential doctrine that, after the pass-
> ing of the late Siyyid, there must be someone else who assumes his title.
> It is now ﬁve months since his death. After him, who is the leader of the
> cause?” “As yet,” [Mullá Husayn] replied, “we have recognized no one.
> After him, no successor is speciﬁed. Rather, we anticipate the Author of
> the Cause, Whose advent is expected by all, to appear.” “What manner
> of man,” He asked, “must the Author of the Cause be?” The Akhúnd
> pondered for a moment and then enumerated a certain number of the
> spiritual and physical67 characteristics of the expected Person. “Do you
> observe these in Me?” As Mullá Husayn had not observed any signs of
> knowledge during his Host’s residence in Karbalá and knew that He had
> not studied with the deceased teachers, responded, “I do not see any of
these qualities in you.” His Holiness did not respond to this.

After a while, [Mullá Husayn] observed several books in a small niche.
Examining one of them, he found it to be a commentary on the Surih

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh adds parenthetically: The Báb’s place of business was at the custom
building, known as the caravansary.

> and realized that the phrase, “exposition of the essence of the essence,” was

> I will listen.” His Holiness read for a time, and then with the customary
> haughtiness of an Akhúnd, Mullá Husayn said, “It is enough. That was
suﬃcient. Do not trouble Yourself any further.”

Mullá Husayn enjoyed lunch and then rested for a while. In the late
> afternoon, His Holiness had invited several merchants and Shaykhí ʿulamá
> to drink tea and meet the Akhúnd. [In the course of the conversation,] it
> was agreed that the next morning they would all gather at Masjid Ilkhání
where the Akhúnd would deliver a lecture.

The group gathered, as appointed, in the mosque. When the Akhúnd
> [Mullá Husayn] wanted to start his discourse, he found that in place of
> eloquent expression and clear explanations, he had become tongue-tied,
> to the extent that he lost all power of speech. Filled with amazement, he
> thought, “this is so contrary to custom and nature, it must have some
> purpose,” and he wondered “who is exercising this secret control, and
> what might be his object in rendering me mute and in such state of
> ecstasy that, in this gathering, I am like one who has been transported
[p.55] in spirit?”. Such was his powerlessness, and so strong the astonishment

> and emotion which took possession of him, that he was not able to speak
> on any topic, and he cancelled the meeting and returned to his lodgings,
deeply bewildered.

The next day when he wished to deliver his lecture, he found himself
> even more mute and devoid of ready knowledge than the previous day.

There was nothing he could do but apologize to the audience.

The same happened on the third day. On this last occasion, he departed
> from the mosque in a state of utmost misery and perplexity. The Exalted
> One, noting Mullá Husayn’s despondency, told the rest of their friends to
> go to their own houses, while he took Mullá Husayn, with his consent,
to His own home.

When they arrived at His Sacred House, after a short rest, the Báb
> said, “By what proofs and signs of his station, can you recognize the
> Author of the Cause, and by what proof can you pass from distraction
> and wandering in the valley of search to recognizing the Beloved and have
> complete conﬁdence in the guidance He gives?” Mullá Husayn answered,
> “By scientiﬁc writings and by the Exalted Point which is the well-spring
> and center of all the knowledge of past and future prophets and saints.”
> “Do you perceive these qualities in Me?” He inquired, “What if I were
> so endowed with such attributes?” Upon hearing this, Mullá Husayn was
> deeply perturbed, and said, “That You are devout, godly, and holy of life,
> is true; but innate knowledge and inﬁnite wisdom are the only entry and
> evidence of this most exalted Station.” At this comment, His Holiness
> was silent for while as though in wonder, while Mullá Husayn thought to
> himself, “What idea can this devout and sincere Youth be harboring that
> He so persistently introduces this topic, although he has no education? I
> must at all events ask some questions of His honored Person which He
> has never heard discussed and cannot answer, so that He may be turned
aside from His vain imaginings.”

Therefore, he presented to His Holiness a question which appeared to
> him very diﬃcult to resolve, and which he had always had in mind during
> the lifetime of the late Siyyid [Kázim], but had never found an opportu-
> nity of propounding it in such wise as to have the diﬃculty removed in
> a satisfactory manner. Without hesitation, his Host provided a full and
> suﬃcient answer. Mullá Husayn was ﬁlled with amazement. He asked
> another diﬃcult question, which his Host again answered comprehensively
> and conclusively. Mute with astonishment, [Mullá Husayn] reﬂected to
> himself, “Is not this Youth Who but a few days ago did not correctly
> read the Commentary on the Surih Baqara? How is it that He has now
> become the source and well-spring of all the sciences of the past?” All
manners of thoughts ﬁlled his being.

All of a sudden, he observed His Holiness anew: he was sitting in a
> most digniﬁed and majestic attitude, the left hand laid on the left knee and
> the right hand over it. He began to utter most wondrous verses contain-
> ing answers to whatever question passed through Mullá Husayn’s mind,
> until many verses had been revealed from the Fount of Divine Revelation.

> During this entire period, Mullá Husayn waited anxiously for Him to
conclude, so strong was the fear and awe that possessed him.

At length He ceased, and [Mullá Husayn], in the extremity of terror,
> rose up to ﬂee, as some delinquent might ﬂee from a mighty sovereign.
> He asked permission to take his leave, but His Holiness responded,
> “Remain seated! Where are you going? Anyone who beholds you in this
> state would think you had lost your mind.” Constrained by His bidding,
> he could do nothing but sit again, while His Holiness withdrew to the
private section of the House.

During His absence, the Akhúnd [Mullá Husayn] was prey to most
> anxious thoughts. Care for worldly interests and the possibility of opposi-
> tion from divers quarters, the need for caution and prudence, all passed
> through his mind. However, he realized that in the presence of the Lord,
[p.60] he could not be insincere, nor oﬀer excuses and objections. He saw no way

> out save confession and acceptance. He was greatly perturbed, agitated,
and troubled beyond all measure.

An hour later, contrary to His practice on other days, the Báb Himself
> brought in the tea, seated Himself near Akhúnd [Mullá Husayn], and
> showered him with most gracious expressions. He poured tea [for Mullá
> Husayn] and handed him the cup, but the honored Akhúnd, remained as
> one distraught and so amazed that he again asked permission to depart.
> “You are still in a state of extreme bewilderment,” [the Báb] informed
> him, “though you are not yourself aware of it. Anyone who saw you in
this state, would think you were possessed.”

After an hour, however, when he had regained his composure, [Mullá
Husayn] was permitted to take his leave.69

On the occasion of the next visit, [Mullá Husayn] was shown a com-
mentary that the Báb had written on the Hadíth-i Jariyyih.70 He read it

The date of the Báb’s Declaration is ﬁxed in the Persian Bayán 6:13 and 2:7, “And
> from the moment when the Tree of the Bayán appeared until it disappeared is the Res-
> urrection of the Apostle of God, as is divinely foretold in the Qurʾán; the beginning of
> which was when two hours and eleven minutes had passed on the eve of the ﬁfth of
> Jamádíyuʾl-Avval, AH 1260 [22 May 1844], which is the year of 1270 of the Declara-
> tion of the Mission of Muhammad” (translation in Selections from the Writings of the Báb,
> p. 107). In a Tablet in honor of Mírzá Qábil of Ábádih, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá speciﬁes this date
as Kamál (8th) of Azamat; see Ishráq-Khávarí, Gangínih Hudúd va Ahkám, p. 426.

Ishráq-Khávarí, Kitáb Muhadhirat, p. 14, notes that Jariyyih was a daughter of Khadíjih,
> the wife of Muhammad. For a discussion of this Tradition of the Handmaiden attributed
> to Imám Jaʿfar Sádiq, see Kulayni, al-Usul min al-Kaﬁ, vol. 1, pp. 95–96. See also Rieu,

> and recalled that the late Siyyid [Kázim] had stated when he was alive
> that the Proof Who was to appear would compose a full explanation of
> this Tradition. Now Mullá Husayn saw his Promised manifest before
> him. Moreover, he remembered that one day, when he was alone with
> the late Siyyid [Kázim] in the library, in the course of conversation, he
> [Mullá Husayn] had asked why the Surih Yúsuf [Joseph] of the Qurʾán
> is titled the Ahsanuʾl-Qisas [the Best of Stories], to which the late Siyyid
> had replied that it was not then the proper occasion for explaining the
reason. This incident remained concealed in his mind.

Now His Holiness said, “Mullá Husayn, do you recall inquiring once
> of the late Siyyid, why the Surih Yúsuf is called the Ahsanuʾl-Qisas, and
> how he replied that the proper occasion for explaining this had not yet
> come? The time for this explanation has now arrived.” Then He showed
> [Mullá Husayn] a commentary on this Surih revealed from the Most
> Exalted Pen. On reading it, the eminent Akhúnd attained the shore of
> faith and prostrated himself in gratitude to God.71

In the course of the ﬁrst section of the Báb, Kitáb Panj Shaʾn (the Book of Five Modes),
> p. 9, revealed on the sixth anniversary of His declaration, the Báb describes the night of His
declaration in the language of prayer:

> In the name of God. There is no God but God. Sanctiﬁed art Thou, O God, My God.
> I testify that at an hour such as this, Thou hast bestowed honor and exaltation, glory
> and loftiness upon this night and hast sanctiﬁed it above all other nights through Thy
> Manifestation. This is the hour of the appearance of the Point of Bayán, Who is the
> sign of Thy dawning, the countenance of Thy morn of eternity, the evidence of Thy
> unity, the manifestation of Thy oneness, the conﬁrmation of Thy loftiness, the signiﬁer
> of Thy holiness, and the very essence of the divinity of Thy kingdom. Sanctiﬁed and
> exalted art Thou, that thou hast gloriﬁed this hour by creating whatsoever is within
> the Bayán and by decreeing the manifestation of whatsoever Thou willest. I testify and
> all things testify that on such a night as this I was at My house before Thy threshold
> when the ﬁrst person [i.e., Mullá Husayn] who has tasted the sweetness of Thy love
> in this Ridván attained to Me. He prostrated himself before Thy eﬀulgence in this
> Paradise, and with him were the Letters of the Three. At such an hour, Thou didst
> cause Me to show Myself to him. Sanctiﬁed and exalted art Thou for enabling him
> [i.e., Mullá Husayn] to recognize upon hearkening unto the signs of Thy guidance,
> and for having created in him a clear vision when I made mention of Thee. Therefore
> praise and gratitude be to Thee, O My God, a praise the like of which no soul hath
> oﬀered in the past nor any will oﬀer in the future, and such gratitude as none before
> hath oﬀered and none will oﬀer in the future, for the ﬁrst who recognized My person,
> and for the recognition with which he recognized Me.

> From this passage it is not clear whether the three travel companions of Mullá Husayn also
> attained the presence of the Báb that very night, or on a later occasion.

Conversion of Mullá Sádiq Khurásání

> Mullá Husayn said, “During our stay at the Masjid Kuﬁh and Mas-
> jid Sahlih prior to dispersing [in search of the Promised Qáʾim], my
> companions and I established a pact that whichever of us ﬁrst heard the
> Call of Truth would inform the others. One in particular, Akhúnd Mullá
> Sádiq [known as] Muqaddas Khurásání, proceeded towards Isfahán and
> is now in that city. Please instruct me to go to Isfahán and to inform
> him so that he, too, may attain the station of faith.” “There is no harm
> in that,” the Báb replied, “however, it must be conditioned upon several
> things.” “Whatever is Your command,” [Mullá Husayn] responded, “I will
instantly and faithfully obey.”

The Báb then revealed a detailed commentary on one of the shorter
> Surihs of the Qurʾán and entrusted it to the honored Akhúnd Mullá
> Husayn, instructing him, “Take this commentary with you to Isfahán.
> After you have renewed your acquaintance with the Akhúnd [Mullá Sádiq
> Muqaddas], ﬁrst ask if, during his travels, he has heard of, or met, anyone
> who advanced a claim to be the Promised One? Should he respond that
> he has neither met a claimant nor heard of such a call, ask if he himself
> is putting forth a claim. Should he present one, he must conﬁrm it by
> means of divine verses, in the way that you have witnessed. Only if he
> states that he has no claim of his own are you to present him with this
> commentary, without identifying its Author, as he himself must discern
[the Source of Revelation].”

Mullá Husayn proceeded to Isfahán in accordance with the Báb’s
> instructions and upon arrival, was reunited with Mullá Sádiq. “O honored
> Akhúnd,” he asked him, “after we separated, did you meet any claimant
> or hear any call?” “I have encountered no one, and heard no call,” he
> replied. “Do you suspect any qualities in yourself, which could serve as
> evidence of some exalted station?” Deeply puzzled, Mullá Sádiq rejoined,
> “Have you gone mad? You and I are of no account. The One who raises a
> call must possess innate knowledge. Have you lost your rational faculties,
> that you ask such a question?”
[p.65]    Upon being certain of Mullá Sádiq’s position, in accordance with the

> Báb’s wish, he presented the commentary to him. After reading a little
> of it, Mullá Sádiq seized the hem of Mullá Husayn’s garment, demand-
> ing, “Who wrote this commentary? The Author of these words is cer-
> tainly the Truth. Where is He, and Who is He?” Refusing to answer his
> question directly, [Mullá Husayn] said “I am not permitted to say; you

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 28                                                                   7/10/2008 3:45:08 PM

> must discern it for yourself.” In the face of [Mullá Sádiq’s] insistence, he
remained adamant.

Soon the darkness of dusk fell, and supper was served. Afterwards, the
> honored Mullá Husayn retired, satisﬁed in the knowledge that he had
carried out the mission entrusted him in its totality.72

The story of Mullá Sádiq and the manner of his recognition is well
> loved and is no doubt related thoroughly in narratives of the history of
Isfahán. As such, this servant will not add to the burden of the reader.

In short, after achieving certitude, Mullá Sádiq together with several
> others proceeded to Shíráz so that they would attain the blessed presence
> [of the Báb]. Upon arrival in Shíráz, however, they learned that His Holi-
ness had departed on His journey to Mecca.

The honored Akhúnd Mullá Sádiq and his companions began to propa-
> gate the news of the Revelation, particularly in the Masjid Báqir-Ábád.
> Ascending the pulpit, they would present proofs to the people. This matter
> was reported to the ʿulamá, who consulted [on the matter]. By order of
> [the Governor] Husayn Khán, the Ajúdán-Báshí, known as Sáhib-Ikhtíyár,
> those illustrious personages were seized, beaten with sticks, their beards
> burnt, their noses pierced and a rope passed through the incision. From
> dawn to dusk, the executioner paraded them through the bazaar and
received a sum of money from each shopkeeper and artisan.

At sunset, those oppressed ones, being extremely hungry and fatigued,
and having been severely beaten and injured, were expelled from the city.73

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh has added the following marginal note in his own hand: “Áqá
> Mírzá ʿAlí-Muhammad, the illustrious son of Mullá Muhammad-Sádiq Muqaddas related
> for me the following description which he had heard from his honored father: ‘No mat-
> ter how I implored Mullá Husayn [to divulge the name of Him Who claimed to be the
> promised Manifestation], he refused and would only state that it was forbidden for him to
> do so and that I must seek Him independently. Disappointed by this response, I proceeded
> to the room set aside for devotions and performed my ablutions. I spread the prayer mat
> and began my supplications. I entreated with such earnestness that the tears pouring from
> my eyes dampened the prayer mat. In the midst of such contemplation and in a state of
> near-unconsciousness, I beheld the Young Siyyid that I had met in the gathering of late
> Siyyid [Kázim Rashtí]. He stood over me saying, ‘What do you desire? If you seek Faith,
> it stands apparent and manifest.’ This experience was repeated twice before dawn. After
> the third occurrence of this vision, I came to the room where Mullá Husayn was resting.
> I woke him and said, ‘Mullá Husayn, I have discovered the identity of the Master of this
> Cause. It must be none other than that same Shirází Siyyid that we met in the ʿAtabát.’
Mullá Husayn responded aﬃrmatively.”

investigate the matter.74

Upon arrival at that city and meeting the Báb in the street, without

> travelling to Mecca.78 Shaykh Háshim (a brother of the Imám-Jumʿih of
> Shíráz, Shaykh Abú-Turáb) who was much hated and very quarrelsome,
was also among this group of pilgrims.

That year, pilgrims from all corners of the world where Muslims live
> were proceeding towards Mecca, for according to the Islamic teachings,
> whenever the 10th day of Dhiʾl-Hajjih, which is the observance of the
> ʿId-i Adha [the Festival of Sacriﬁce], falls on a Friday, that pilgrimage is

> an occasion], the Qáʾim will place His back against the wall in the court
of the Masjiduʾl-Ahrám and will openly declare His Cause.

At that time, journey by sea was most diﬃcult and disagreeable, as
> steam vessels did not operate in the Persian Gulf. It was necessary to go
> by sailing ship, which made the voyage to Jaddih by sea a minimum of
> three or four months. One day the late Hájí Abúʾl-Hasan [who had been [p.70]
> a travel companion of the Báb] described his pilgrimage journey to this
servant, saying:

> During the time I was in the presence of His Holiness aboard the ship,
> there was a large group of pilgrims, who for the most part were hostile
> [towards the Báb]. Among them was Shaykh Abú-Háshim who molested
> [Him] both verbally and physically, and would cause great discomfort for
> His Holiness. The aﬀront and nuisance he caused reached such a degree
> that on several occasions the captain of the ship came and reprimanded

From Búshihr, the Báb sent the following letter to His wife in Shíráz (Text quoted
> in Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, pp. 166–67, the original letter is displayed in the International
Baháʾí Archives in Haifa):

> O the best of Protectors! In the Name of God, the Exalted.
My sweet life! May thou be guarded by God!
It was not because of sadness that I did not write sooner,

Nor was it due to My heart being sorrowed
Nay, My hand wrote thee,

But My tears washed away the words.
God is My witness that I have been overcome with so much sorrow since our
> separation that it cannot be described. However, since we are all seized in the grasp
> of destiny, such has been decreed for us. May the Lord of the world, by the right-
eousness of the Five Near-Ones, ordain My return.

It is now two days since we arrived in Búshihr. The temperature is extremely hot,
> but the Lord of creation will protect [us]. Apparently, our ship will sail this very
> month. May God watch over Us, out of His mercy. At the time of departure, it was

> him not to torment the innocent Siyyid [i.e., the Báb]. However, he did
not change his behavior.

One day he started an argument with the captain and uttered such
> unseemly words that the latter became so aggravated that he instructed his
> sailors to seize the Shaykh and throw him in the sea. Greatly perturbed
> and enraged, the captain himself stood nearby, and the sailors hastened to
> bring the Shaykh to throw him in the sea. At that instant, His Holiness
> arrived and interceded. The captain did not accept [His intercession] and
commanded loudly, “Throw this accursed one into the sea!”

Seeing that they were about to throw the Shaykh in the sea, His Holi-
> ness threw Himself on the Shaykh and embraced him ﬁrmly, and pleaded
> with the captain to forgive the Shaykh’s oﬀences one more time, on His
> account. Deeply moved by the benevolence and the generosity manifested by
> His Holiness, the captain accepted His intercession. Then he said, “Master,
> this accursed one has wronged you more than anyone else, so You should
> be even more eager than others to see him perish. Why did You stop us?”
> “Such people only harm themselves,” the Báb said, “we should look upon
> their deeds with sin-covering eyes.” The meekness exhibited by His sacred
> Self and His intercession on behalf of the Shaykh caused a change of heart
> among many passengers, and they no longer displayed enmity and hatred,
instead becoming repentant and remorseful.

Once our ship had arrived at Jaddih, His Holiness proceeded towards
> Mecca. That year, there were innumerable pilgrims. Roughly speaking, the
> Arab, Turkish, Iranian, Kurdish, and Indian pilgrims, together totaling in
> excess of seventy thousand, for the most part came from the ranks of the
> ʿulamá and the learned. Many had mastered the science of divination and
> jafr [numerology] and had determined that in that year, the True Sum-
> moner would openly issue his summons in Mecca, and they had come to
witness the event.

Among them was the renowned Hájí Siyyid Jaʿfar Kashfí,79 who ranked
> as the ablest in the ﬁeld of numerology and who had a profound knowledge
> of jafr. He had studied the Hadíth-i Marvy narrated by the Immaculate
> One [the eighth Imám, ʿAlí ar-Ridá], upon Him rest peace: “In the year
> Sixty, His Cause will be made manifest and His Remembrance exalted,” and
> the allusions of certain mystics who had openly given many signs for His
> appearance, such as Sháh Niʿmatuʾlláh Valí, who in his poems had clearly
given the news of the Manifestation:

According to the Abjad system, ghars has a numerical value of (1000+200+60=)1260,
hence signifying the year of the appearance of the Báb.

And again:
With the passing of ghars years,

I see the Absent One has appeared.
And also in the collection of poetry by Khajih Háﬁz:
Behold the crest of the moon in Muharram,

and drink from the wine cup,
> Since this is a sign of safety and absence of harm,
and augurs the year of peace and love.

He [i.e., Siyyid Jaʿfar] had studied these according to the science of
> numerology and had consulted an expert in divination: “As this is the year
> ‘sixty,’ will the Qáʾim appear in Mecca?” To which he had received an aﬃr-
> mative response. He had then asked, “If I go [on pilgrimage], will I attain
> the presence of the Qáʾim?” And again he had received a positive response.
> The Siyyid had then asked if he was destined to become a follower of the
Qáʾim, to which the expert responded: “You will not become a believer.”

I myself met Hájí Siyyid Jaʿfar in Mecca. He saw [the Báb] with his own
> eyes and heard [Him proclaim His Faith] with his own ears but did not
become a believer.

Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí [Quddús], some other believers, and I were
> in His blessed presence [of the Báb]. After the conclusion of the pilgrim-
> age rites throngs of pilgrims were present in the Masjiduʾl-Haram, and all [p.75]
> the courtyards and rooftops overﬂowed with waves of people. His Holiness
> approached the Shrine and leaned His blessed back against the Kaʿbih,
> holding the door-chain with His sacred Hand. With the utmost clarity
> and eloquence He announced three times loudly: “I am the Qáʾim Whose
appearance you have been expecting!”

It was a true wonder that despite of the massive multitude and the noise,
> as soon as the Báb begun to speak a complete silence overcame that whole
> area in such wise that if a bird were to ﬂap its wings, everybody would hear.
> Once complete silence was established over everyone, He uttered the same
> blessed proclamation three times, with the utmost distinctness, so that all
the pilgrims could hear.

The pilgrims were recounting and translating the Báb’s words for one
> another. All conversations among the multitude concerned only this event.
> Indeed, the very ﬁrst topic that the pilgrims of every land wrote about to
> their kinfolk was that a young merchant and Siyyid, twenty-ﬁve years of
> age, had taken hold of the Kaʿbih’s chain and with resounding voice had
advanced the claim of the Qáʾimiyyat.

In a short time, this news was spread in all parts of the world. Those
> who sought the Truth and whose souls were prepared to attain any degree
> of certitude responded, “We hear and obey!”81 and made haste on the
> pathway of Faith.

CHAPTER FOUR

RETURN OF THE BÁB TO SHÍRÁZ

Return from Búshihr

> The time was nigh for the arrival of His Holiness in Shíráz.83 Shaykh Abú- [p.77:6]
> Háshim, [brother of Imám-Jumʿih,] wrote a most provocative account to
> Shíráz, promoting mischief and raising the cry, “Our religion is lost!” A
> great excitement was caused when his letter reached Shíráz. A contingent
> of the ʿulamá, such as Shaykh Husayn Zalim [the tyrant], known as the
> Názimuʾsh-Shariʿah; Akhúnd Mullá Muhammad-ʿAlí Mahallátí; Shaykh
> Mahdí Kajawví; and a score of others went before Husayn Khán, who
> was at that time the governor-general of Shíráz. They complained, “The
> Siyyid Who publicly claimed [the station of ] the Qáʾimiyyat and the
> Bábiyyat84 in Mecca will shortly arrive [in Shíráz], and you must join
> with the adherents of Islam in quenching this ﬁre and silencing this Call,
> so it is kept under control.” Husayn Khán gave in to the ﬂattery of the
> clerics. When the Báb arrived at Búshihr, Husayn Khán sent a mounted
> escort of several men to Búshihr to arrest His Holiness and to return
Him to Shíráz.

Late one afternoon, His Holiness was standing on an elevation by
> the village of Dálakí,85 a distance of two days’ journey to Búshihr, when
> the troops passed through that location. His Holiness instructed Hájí

The Báb gives the following chronology of His travels in a Khutbih [Sermon] (Ishráq-
Khávarí, Kitáb Muhádirát, pp. 729–31):

> Left Shíráz                    10 September 1844
> Arrived Búshihr                19 September 1844
> Left the port                  2 October 1844
> Reached Mecca                  12 December 1844
> Hajj Completed                 24 December 1844
> Left Mecca                     7 January 1845

> Mubárak, “Go quickly and ask the soldiers where they are going and
> what their mission is.” In accordance with His command, Hájí Mubárak
> approached the soldiers and asked where they were going. The soldiers,
> being argumentative, said, “Where we are going and what we are doing is
> none of your business, black man!” Hájí Mubárak returned to His presence
> and informed Him, “The horsemen refused to say what their mission is.”
> The Báb said, “Go and tell them to come to Me.” Hájí Mubárak went
> to the soldiers and said, “My Master asked that you should be so kind as
to come, so that we can make your acquaintance.”

A certain Aslán Khán, who was older and wiser than the rest, came
> back with Hájí Mubárak and attained His blessed presence. He was asked,
> “Where are you going and what mission have you been given?” The
> soldier again refused to divulge their orders. The Báb said, “No reason
[p.80] to conceal it: your mission is to take the Siyyid-i Báb to Shíráz. Do not

> trouble yourselves. I stand ready. If you went on to Búshihr according to
> your orders and passed this village by, you would not accomplish your
> mission.” The oﬃcial looked closely at His Countenance and noted all the
> signs that he had been given in Shíráz to identify Him and realized that
> this was the Siyyid in person. He returned to his companions and reported
> what had transpired, which caused them all to exclaim with wonder, “If
> a man is sought by the government or the people, it is only natural for
> him to ﬂee the oﬃcers sent to take him under guard from one place to
> another. How is it then that with the utmost courage and ﬁrmness this
> Personage has come forward, informing us that He is undoubtedly the
object of our quest? Of a certainty He must be of the true!”

The valor of the Báb awakened the consciousness of the men. They
> attained His blessed presence, and His Holiness showered upon them His
> immense kindness and benevolence. He instructed Hájí Mubárak to serve
> them the supper he had prepared, as these men had been traveling and
> were hungry and tired. Hájí Mubárak served the same quantity of food that
> he had prepared for two persons and brought it. The men saw that there
> was very little food and that it would not even suﬃce one of them, but
> they sat to dine and ate their ﬁll. This experience deepened their wonder.

In the course of the journey they witnessed many such miracles.86

In a Tablet dated 24 Jamádíyʾth-Thání AH 1261/30 June 1845 to His uncle, Hájí
> Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, the Báb mentions the esteem that the horsemen showed Him during
> this journey (A.Q. Afnán, private communications, August 1993).

return of the báb to shíráz                      37

With the utmost respect and dignity, the men accompanied His Holi-
> ness to Shíráz and told their friends and acquaintances of what they had
> observed and of the grandeur and majesty of the Báb.

Return of the Exalted One from Mecca to Shíráz in AH 1261 [1845]

> In all events, after the true ʿulamá, who were the heralds of the Mani-
> festation, had raised the news of the Cause throughout the realm and it
> had been particularly widely reported in Shíráz, His Holiness returned
> from Mecca in AH 1261. When He proclaimed His Cause publicly in
> Mecca, the news spread even further than before. This is reported in all
the histories of the Cause and will be recounted brieﬂy here as well.

In short, His Holiness arrived in Shíráz in the company of the guards.

> They proceeded directly to the governor’s oﬃce and reported their arrival.
> They recounted all that had occurred—how they had met Him at the
> ﬁrst staging-post at Dálakí and what they had seen with their own eyes
> along the way—to the Nizamuʾd-Dawlih. Husayn Khán ordered that His
> Holiness should be detained. This news spread fast. Some ignorant people
> with a reputation for knowledge were present and began to torment and
> mock [the Báb]. They attributed to Him what was applicable to themselves.
Shaykh Husayn Zálim tormented His Holiness with his own hand.

When the maternal uncle [of the Báb] and the revered mother of His
> Holiness were informed of these events, they were deeply perturbed. The
> latter went to her brother, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, and began to lament
and bewail [over the condition of her Son].

The Báb’s maternal uncle departed for the governor’s oﬃce. On meet-
> ing Husayn Khán, he said, “It is reported that His Holiness has returned
> from the exalted city of Mecca, and His mother and other members of
> His family have been awaiting His arrival. Why have you detained Him?
> Is He not a descendant of the Prophet of God? Is there no shame before
> His illustrious Ancestor?” Noting the forceful manner in which the uncle
> defended Him, Husayn Khán replied, “If you will mediate and serve as
> a guarantor that He will not go to meet with anyone, that no one will
> be admitted to Him, and that He will not write anything or share His
writing with anyone, I will release Him.”

Because the illustrious uncle, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, was respected
> by the merchants and associated with reputable people, he responded,
> “I associate with men from all strata of society, and His Holiness is my
> Nephew and has returned from Mecca. Naturally, the people want to [p.85]

> see Him. How can I give my word, when He has come from Mecca, to
> say that He may not see people?” Faced with irrefutable logic, Husayn
> Khán responded, “For three days, people may come and go, but on the
> fourth day, you are to close the door to all and allow no one to visit your
> house.” Having given his surety on these terms, the uncle brought His
Holiness home with him.

[Upon the Báb’s arrival home], His mother and His blessed wife, along
> with other friends and relatives, attained His honored presence, and for
> three days all the believers and friends delighted in this union and ben-
> eﬁted from its immeasurable spiritual bestowal. Divine verses were sent
> down like a continuous rain: all were recorded in His own blessed Hand
on large sheets of cashmere paper and bestowed upon the visitors.

On completion of the three days, all access was denied to the friends,
> and no one was permitted to attain the presence [of the Báb]. However,
> even if the Sun of Reality is covered by a sullen cloud of formal restric-
> tions, its radiance and eﬀulgence shines ever more apparent. Consequently,
> although to all appearances the believers were denied access [to the Báb],
> they still continued to submit to Him their questions and diﬃculties,
> and to receive replies, for it is incumbent on the generous to answer him
> who asks, especially when the questions refer to religious matters, and
> the demands are for guidance and direction in the path of salvation. The
> result was that many people, including people from the surrounding areas,
> came to inquire into the matter, submitted their questions, and received
> full and satisfactory answers, each according to his own capacity, so that
> they too were led to believe.87

Arrival of Vahíd Dárábí

> One of those who attained the presence [of the Báb] in Shíráz was the
> honored Áqá Siyyid Yahyá Dárábí. His story is wonderful and amazing:
> he was the illustrious son of Hájí Siyyid Jaʿfar Kashfí, who has been men-
> tioned in the recollections of Hájí Abúʾl-Hasan, in the section pertaining
to Mecca.

[Siyyid Yahyá Dárábí] was eminent among the mujtahids and students
> of truth, gifted with supernatural faculties and an exalted spiritual station,
> unrivalled in debate and investigation, no less than for his austerity and
> piety. At that time he was in Tihrán. The late Muhammad Sháh Qájár

> trusted him profoundly, to the extent that he would not take any action or
> assign any task contrary to the permission and the fatwa of Siyyid Yahyá.
> When the news of this Cause reached the monarch’s ears, he summoned
> the honored Áqá Siyyid Yahyá and said, “According to the information
> received at our court, a certain Personage in Fárs has advanced a claim to
> the stations of Qáʾimiyyat and Bábiyyat. As you enjoy our utmost con-

> of such universal purport. Send word to our court regarding the truth or
> falsity of these claims, so that we may know our civil and religious duties.
> You must depart with all haste, and write a prompt report on this issue
> for us.” He provided for his expenses, ordered that he be provided with
a horse, and sent him on his way to Shíráz.

Upon arrival at Shíráz he met with the honored Hájí Siyyid Javád
> Karbaláʾí, who was a scholar of divinity and wise in the wisdom of the
> eternal. The two had been friends and associates in the ʿAtabát. Through
> him, [Siyyid Yahyá] met with several other [Bábí] ʿulamá and prominent
> believers and, having explained the purpose of his investigation, requested
> a meeting [with the Báb]. However, the summons was delayed because of
> various obstacles. He spent the interval in examining some of the revealed
> verses. Finding in them no ground for objection or denial, he said in
> conﬁdence to the honored Hájí Siyyid Javád, “These luminous words and
> verses bear witness to the truth of the claim and leave no room for doubt;
> yet were I permitted to behold some miracle or sign beyond this, I would
> gain a fuller certitude and assurance.” That illustrious person answered, [p.90]
> “If we were to ask that Perfect Reality for wonders and miracles, we would
> be like those who have seen a thousand marvels more wonderful than the
> fabled cleaving of the moon, but are so befuddled that they continue to
seek light from a candle or lantern in the full blaze of the radiant sun.”

In short, Áqá Siyyid Yahyá prepared a petition, requesting that a com-
> mentary on the blessed Surih of Kawthar be revealed for his ediﬁcation.
> One night, about four hours after sunset, he himself took this supplication
> to the Blessed House of the Báb and attained His presence, presenting
> his request. [The Báb] instructed him to return at dawn to receive the
response to his request.

In the early dawn, as bidden, [Siyyid Yahyá] again attained His presence
> and was given the response in the form of an unrivaled commentary on
> the Surih of Kawthar extending to nearly ﬁve thousand written verses.88

He returned with it to his own home. Then, astonished by the number

For comparison, the Qurʾán is slightly more than 6,600 verses.

> Karbaláʾí, he remarked, “I have beheld a marvel a hundred-thousand-fold
> beyond what I have [previously] witnessed, for, with all my learning and
> scholarship, I spent nine whole days in writing one single page of ques-
> tions containing not more than twelve lines. At four hours into the night,
> I presented them myself, and at dawn, I received such a response! I am
> astonished that these luminous verses, of such eloquence and clarity of
> style, should be revealed and written down during ﬁve or six hours of the
latter part of the night, which is the time for His rest and sleeping.”

As soon as Áqá Siyyid Yahyá had studied that most precious proof, he

> some little while, during which the honor of an interview was accorded
> him, he received permission to set out for Yazd, by way of Bávanát and
> Marvast [Marv-Dasht], to proclaim the blessed Cause and to teach the

The Báb’s Public Announcement at Masjid Vakíl

> In all events, the enmity of enemies was now manifest in the utmost

entered the House of His Holiness.

ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd Khán, the Dárúghih, who was charged with carrying

The Dárúghih thereupon went before Husayn Khán, telling the latter

> and instructed that sticks90 be brought. The illustrious uncle, who was a
> greatly respected Siyyid and more than sixty years of age, was struck with [p.95]

> a sum of money was extracted from the victims, and [as the uncle was
> unable to walk] the farrashes carried him over their shoulders to his house
where he remained injured in bed for a period of time.

His Holiness was subject to brutal treatment and imprisoned in the

One afternoon all the ʿulamá gathered in the Government House, that

must be forced to withdraw His claim.

My brother, Hájí Mírzá Buzurg, and I were present once when the

> Shíráz from every strata to gather in the Masjid Vakíl where the Siyyid-i
> Báb would renounce His claims. I went to the mosque as well and exerted
> particular eﬀort to ﬁnd a spot near [the pulpit] where I could behold Him

> the minarets of the mosque were thronged with people. The governor, the
> ʿulamá, the merchants, and other dignitaries entered and sat in the cloisters,
> near the stone pulpit. (This is a pulpit carved out of one piece of marble
and has fourteen steps.)

I was sitting near the pulpit when a commotion was raised in the court-
> yard: “He is coming!” He entered through the cloister’s entrance accompanied
> by ten farrashes and ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd Khán, the Dárúghih, and drew near the

> dignity, might, grandeur, and magniﬁcence that it is truly indescribable.
> Such a multitude of people in attendance meant nothing to Him, and He
heeded them not in the least.

He said to the ʿulamá and the governor, “What is your purpose in sum-

> should ascend this pulpit and repudiate Your false claim so that this fury
> and excitement may subside.” [The Báb] did not respond and ascended the

> You and hear Your voice.” His Holiness ascended to the top of the pulpit
> and sat there. Suddenly, an absolute silence prevailed and not a whisper
> could be heard from the people, and it seemed as if not a soul was in that
mosque. Everyone was listening most attentively.

At ﬁrst, with utmost majesty and sovereignty, He commenced recitation
> of an exquisite Arabic homily with absolute eloquence and clarity that lasted
> some half an hour. The entire concourse of people, high and low, learned
> and illiterate alike were in total rapture and listened with great fascination.

[p.100]         have told you to aﬃrm, what is this idle chatter?” His Holiness remained

return of the báb to shíráz                               43

Shaykh Husayn Zálim, out of sheer hostility, raised his walking-stick to
> strike His Holiness in the head, when the late Mírzá Abúʾl-Hasan Khán,
> the Mushíruʾl-Mulk, who was a young man in those days, readily brought
> forward his shoulder to ward oﬀ the attack, and it was his shoulder that
> sustained the hit. Afterwards, Husyan Khán instructed that His Holiness
> once again be imprisoned in the home of ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd Khán.

> In short, the aforementioned Hájí [Muʿallim], though not a believer but
> an admirer [of the Báb], related this story to the late ʿAndalíb. His purpose
> was that [the Báb] on that occasion aﬃrmed the truth of His Cause and
> completed His proof before the concourse of people.91

Fatwá Against the Báb

> After His Holiness returned from the mosque and was placed under
> house-arrest at the home of ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd Khán, the entire body of
> the ʿulamá assembled and ﬁxed their seal on a fatwá decreeing the death
> of His Holiness. Among those present who signed the document was
> Shaykh Husayn Zálim, known as the Názimuʾsh-Shariʿah, who was the
> source of all sedition and the prime instigator of mischief. Others were
> Shaykh Abú-Háshim, Shaykh Asaduʾlláh, Shaykh Mihdí Kujúry, Mullá
> Muhammad-ʿAlí Mahallátí, and those like them. They wrote whatsoever
they wished and signed that paper.

That congregation then proceeded to the home of the late Shaykh
> Abú-Turáb,92 the Imám-Jumʿih, who, despite their insistence and every
> eﬀort, had refused to attend their assemblage. Attaining the presence of
> the Shaykh, they acquainted him with their purpose and presented the
> document, requesting him to ﬁx his seal on the paper as well so that the
> matter of the Siyyid be concluded [and the Báb be slain]. Upon perusing
> the fatwa and considering its content, the Shaykh, profoundly moved
> with indignation, threw the paper to the ground and cried, “Have you
> lost your faculties! Never will I sign such a paper, as I have no misgiv-
> ings whatsoever regarding the nobility, chastity, integrity, sagacity, piety,
> and virtue of this Siyyid! In this Youth, I behold the ultimate manifesta-
> tion of Islamic and human attributes, as well as evidence of the highest

A son of Shaykh Muhammad Záhid [pious] who had served as the Imám-Jumʿih of

Departure for Isfahán

> In short, at this time, for the warning and awakening of the neglectful
> and the ignorant, the Ocean of Divine Wrath stirred forth, and a grievous
> cholera epidemic fell upon Iran and raged with especial fury over Shíráz.
> Great multitudes from all ranks, including nobles, peasants, learned,
> illiterate, ministers, and subjects made haste to escape from this evident
> calamity. The ﬁrst to retreat was Husayn Khán, the governor, and then
others followed from all ranks of society.

A large number died. It chanced that the two young sons of ʿAbduʾl-
> Hamíd Khán, the Dárúghih, fell ill of the cholera and came nigh to
> death’s door. Their mother, deeply agitated, spoke harshly to her husband,
> ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd Khán, saying, “Their illness is because of your evil doings
[p.105] towards this wronged Siyyid Who has been unjustly imprisoned here.

> Through such negligence, you will bring ruin upon yourself and the whole
> household. Let this innocent Siyyid leave.” ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd Khán besought
> the Báb, earnestly stating, “Depart for wherever Your holy inclinations
> may lead You.” [The Báb] responded, “Husayn Khán has ﬂed from the
> city in the face of divine chastisement; however, when he returns, you
> will be responsible [for My whereabouts].” “It is I,” ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd Khán
> pleaded, “who must remain answerable to Husayn Khán as, because of
> my misdeeds, my sons are now near death. After them, I wish not to live
> any longer in this world.” He cried bitterly for the fate that had befallen
> him and beseeched the intercession of His Holiness, Who prayed and
> responded by handing him a sweet pomegranate and stating, “Have your
> sons eat from this fruit.” After the lads had partaken of the pomegranate
> and full recovery was theirs, ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd Khán, having witnessed the
> occurrence of this miracle, implored Him, “Do not tarry, even for one

> hour, in this dwelling, I will not prevent Your departure in whatever direc-
> tion You will. And furthermore, I stand ready to oﬀer whatever service
that Your Holiness may require.”

[The Báb] retired to His house, and there the family and kinsmen came
> to visit Him. Later, in the company of Áqá Muhammad-Husayn Ardistání,
> who was reckoned among the believers and among His close companions,
> [the Báb] proceeded for the city of Isfahán.93 The events occurring in that
> land are indeed beyond all description and assuredly have been recorded
> in the narratives pertaining to that city. For our purposes, only the fol-
lowing note regarding the incidents of Isfahán should suﬃce.

Upon arrival in the city of Isfahán, the late Manuchihr Khán, the
> Muʿtamiduʾd-Dawlih,94 exalted be his station, came into the presence [of
> the Báb] and immediately became a most ardent admirer. His Holiness
> described some of the tyranny and injuries that He had previously endured
> at the hand of Husayn Khán, adding, “When We departed from Shíráz,
> cholera raged over the province of Fárs, and Husayn Khán escaped with
> all deliberate speed from the city. I was made captive at the home of
> ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd Khán, but because of the epidemic and the fact that his
> own sons fell victims to the illness, he released this Wronged-One and
> of necessity asked that I leave. In so doing, he remarked, ‘Upon Husayn
> Khán’s return, I will personally shoulder the responsibility.’ Surely, after the
> pandemic of cholera has been eradicated and quiet has once again become
> the city’s norm, Husayn Khán will return and will inquire after Me. As he

In the language of prayer, the Báb gives an outline of the events that had befallen
Him:

> Thou art aware, O My God, that since the day Thou didst call Me into being out of
> the water of Thy love till I reached ﬁfteen years of age I lived in the land that wit-
> nessed My birth [Shíráz]. Then Thou didst enable Me to go to the seaport [Búshihr]
> where for ﬁve years I was engaged in trading with the goodly gifts of Thy realm
> and was occupied in that which Thou favored Me through the wondrous essence
> of Thy loving-kindness. I proceeded therefrom to the Holy Land [Karbalá] where I
> sojourned for one year. Then I returned to the place of My birth. There I experienced
> the revelation of Thy sublime bestowals and the evidences of Thy boundless grace. I
> yield Thee praise for all Thy goodly gifts, and I render Thee thanksgiving for all Thy
> bounties. Then at the age of twenty-ﬁve I proceeded to Thy sacred House [Mecca],
> and by the time I returned to the place where I was born, a year had elapsed. There
> I tarried patiently in the path of Thy love and beheld the evidences of Thy manifold
> bounties and loving-kindness until Thou didst ordain for Me to set out in Thy direc-
tion and to migrate to Thy presence.

> is a wicked and ill-natured man, upon discovering that I no longer reside
> within His grasp, he will injure my kinsmen and family. My purpose is to
> ask your Excellency to petition Husayn Khán that he may not disturb [My
> family].” As soon as this request was made by his distinguished Guest, the
> late Muʿtamiduʾd-Dawlih wrote a detailed letter to the governor-general
> of Fárs, with words to the eﬀect that “the Siyyid-i Báb is a guest in my
> abode in Isfahán, and I stand as His protector. Should the government
> summon Him [to Tihrán for further inquiry], I will personally deliver
> Him. You have no cause to harass His family or inﬂict disturbance upon
them.” This letter was sent to Shíráz with a special envoy.

When the epidemic subsided to a prescribed degree, the people who
> had ﬂed the city returned forthwith, including Husayn Khán who [as
> anticipated by the Báb] immediately inquired from ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd Khán
> the whereabouts of His Holiness. The latter responded, “As the epidemic
> raged uncontrollably throughout the land and my wife and sons had fallen
> victim to the illness as well, I could no longer properly minister His aﬀairs
> and as such asked Him to retire to His own dwelling.” Deeply angered
> by the turn of events, Husayn Khán instructed ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd Khán to
> proceed at once in company of ten farrashes and search the home of His
> Holiness or wherever else He might be and bring Him forthwith to the
> government-house.

Persecution of the Báb’s Family

> As instructed, they proceeded immediately to the House of His Holiness
> and, not ﬁnding Him there, proceeded to the home of His illustrious
> uncle, [Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí,] but were unable to locate the latter at
[p.110] home either. They then proceeded to the residence of the late Hájí Mírzá

> Abúʾl-Qásim. The latter was a paternal cousin of the Báb’s mother and a
> brother of the honored wife of the Báb, [Khadíjih Bagum,] and at the time
> was the renowned standard-bearer of the family. My maternal grandmother
[Zahrá Bagum], who was the sister of the Báb’s wife, related:

> My late brother, that is, Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim, was home suﬀering from
> cholera and resting in bed due to weakness caused by the illness, when
> some time before noon, there was a violent knock on our door. The entire
> household was deeply disturbed. Fírúz, our black, house-born servant, went
> to inquire who it was when suddenly and without warning, ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd
> Khán, the Dárúghih, in the company of a number of farrashes and some
> other lewd characters entered our home and ﬁlled the courtyard. A most
> disturbing uproar ensued as they hurriedly searched the house for any trace

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 46                                                                           7/10/2008 3:45:10 PM

> of His Holiness and disappointed [in their inability to locate the Báb,] came
> to the room where my late brother was resting in bed due to his illness.
> The farrashes placed him on their shoulders and took him before Husayn
Khán, the Sáhib-Ikhtíyár.

Profoundly infuriated, the latter inquired callously, “Where lies the Siyyid-i
> Báb?” “I have been aﬄicted with cholera,” my brother replied, “and still suﬀer
> from the illness. As such, I do not know His whereabouts, nor do I have
> any news of Him.” Husayn Khán dealt with him most harshly and severely
> and ﬁnally he was granted ﬁfteen days to either present His Holiness or to
> pay a ﬁne of ﬁfteen-hundred tumáns.95 Reluctantly, he accepted. Then the
> governor asked for a guarantor, and Hájí Muhammad-Sádiq Isfahání, who
> ranked among the best known and most respected of the merchants and who
> was a very close friend of the honored Hájí, stood in this capacity. After a
surety was extracted, the Hájí was dismissed and returned home.

After the lapse of the agreed upon days, farrashes were sent to summon
> the Hájí [Abúʾl-Qásim] to the governor’s oﬃce and to present him before
> Husayn Khán. The latter, once again, spoke most sternly demanding either
> the delivery of His Holiness or the sum of ﬁfteen-hundred tumáns. The more
> the Hájí implored for mercy and the more he swore that he was bereft of any
> news from Him, the angrier the governor grew. Finally, [unable to withstand
> the governor’s admonishments,] the Hájí fell to the ground unconscious,
> and it was at that moment that the special envoy sent from Isfahán bearing
> the letter of the late Muʿtamiuʾd-Dawlih arrived and the envelope displaying
the seal of Manuchihr Khán presented to Husayn Khán.

Upon considering its content, [Husayn Khán] realized that he could no
> longer cause trouble or remonstrate, but he nevertheless extracted ﬁfteen-
hundred tumáns from him before allowing the late Hájí to leave.

He further issued a command that hereafter should any piece of paper
> be found in that city bearing the handwriting of His Holiness or a verse
revealed by Him, he would demolish that house.

Husayn Khán rounded up all the believers and devotees of His Holiness,
> and, after administering severe beatings with sticks and causing them much
> injury, he extracted from the victims whatever sum they could muster.

> Husayn Khán was an ill-natured, wicked man, and His Holiness the
> Exalted One has described his evil doings in the Khutbih-i Qahriyyih
> addressed to Hájí Mírzá Aqásí, and the reader may refer to that Tablet.96
> From his contemptible, base, and malicious deeds, it can readily be dis-
> cerned how truly evil and corrupt a person Husayn Khán was.

Fifteen-hundred tumáns represented an extraordinarily large sum of money for that
time.

> vol. 3, pp. 85–89. In a Tablet (INBMC, vol. 64, p. 115), the Báb describes the governor

> “was never able to pass a sound judgment.”

The Fate of the Báb’s Writings

In short, my late maternal grandmother would continue relating:

> After the governor’s order was noised in the city, whoever had received such
> Writings [revealed by the Báb] would bring them in bundles and deposit
> the packs in a long vestibule in the house of Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim. One
> side of the courtyard was ﬁlled with such Writings stacked high, all penned
> on large exquisite cashmere papers in the hand of His Holiness. Were even
> a page of those precious Writings available today, it would surely be worth
> an immense fortune. Those papers all contained innumerable commentaries,
> prayers, homilies, and scientiﬁc treaties on diverse themes. The illustrious
> uncle97 of the Báb was asked in what manner were we to dispose of those
> Writings, and he had made reply, “These are all the Words of God and as
> such cannot be treated disrespectfully. Wash the papers and throw the water
> in the well of the courtyard.”
[p.115]                 We placed four large washtubs on the ground of the courtyard, and the

> four of us, that is, the mother [of the Báb], Khadíjih Bagum, the wife of
> Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim,98 and I began to place stacks of these papers in
> the tubs and washed them much like cloths are washed by hand. Page by
> page, the ink was washed away from all the sheets, and the water and the
> papers thrown down the well.99

> Presumably, a reference to Hájí Mírzá Siyyid-ʿAlí.

Her name was Sultán Bagum, and she was from Jahrum.

CHAPTER FIVE

VAHÍD AND THE NAYRÍZ EPISODES

> Subsequent to the departure of His blessed Person [the Báb], the friends [p.115:5]
> in Shíráz observed wisdom and lived in serenity and tranquility. No other
> event took place for a while until the episode of the honored Áqá Siyyid
Yahyá Dárábí and the events of Nayríz transpired.

Earlier in these pages mention was made that the venerable Áqá Siyyid
> Yahyá, [surnamed] Vahíd, came to Yazd from the direction of Bávanát.
> It is important to describe brieﬂy in these pages the occurrences associ-
> ated with his stay in Yazd so that the sequence of events is clariﬁed. Of a
> certainty, the full story of his visit and of the events of Yazd is either told
> in the history of that town [by other narrators], or it will be related.100

Vahíd in Yazd

> After the illustrious Vahíd had believed and pledged submission, in
> accordance with His hallowed instruction [i.e., the Báb’s], he took leave
> of the Latter and set out in direction of Yazd for the ediﬁcation of the
> people, the promulgation of the Word of the Almighty, and the teaching
> of the Cause of God. For a while during the earlier period of his mission
> in that city he had expounded and taught the doctrines of His Holiness
> in gatherings of only such among the accomplished and the learned as
> were prepared and ﬁtted to hear them. But afterwards, according to the
purport of the verse:

Prudence and love can ne’er walk hand in hand,
and the verse:
Love and fair fame must wage eternal war;

O lover, halt not at the beloved’s door!

For the most part, the remainder of this section correlates with the narrative of Siyyid
> Husayn Hamadání, and as such, to the extent possible, the present translation has followed
> the rendering in Táríkh-i Jadíd, pp. 115–26.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 49                                                                                        7/10/2008 3:45:11 PM

> he began openly to proclaim the truth of the Cause and converted a great
> multitude, as well as leading many to profess devotion and sympathy who,
> not having reached the stage of conviction and the haven of assurance,
> were yet greatly attracted and manifested empathy. At length, through
> the oﬃciousness of certain mischievous persons, the governor of Yazd was
> informed of what was taking place. The governor, fearing for himself, sent
> a body of men to arrest him [i.e., Vahíd]. A triﬂing altercation occurred,
> and thereupon the governor readied for battle and prepared to eﬀect his
capture by force of arms.

The esteemed Áqá Siyyid Yahyá retired with a number of his followers
> and friends into the citadel of Yazd, while the myrmidons of the governor
> surrounded it and commenced hostilities and agitation. At length, the
> matter escalated into actual warfare, in the course of which some thirty
> or more of the governor’s men and the rogues and vagabonds [of the
> city who had joined them] were killed, while seven of [Vahíd’s] friends
> and companions were also slain, the rest being besieged for some time
> until some, unwilling to endure further suﬀering or withstand trial,
dispersed.

His honor [Vahíd] therefore determined to set out for Shíráz and said
> one night, “If one of you could manage to lead out my horse, so that I
> might defuse this incident and convey myself to some other place, it would
> be well.” A certain Hasan who had been for some time in attendance upon
> his honor and had performed his service with the utmost faithfulness and
> devotion, witnessing on the part of his august master many a display of
> miraculous and supernatural faculties, replied, “By your leave, I will lead
> out the horse.” “They will capture and slay you,” [responded Vahíd]. “In
> the path of your servitude,” rejoined [Hasan], “that is easy to bear. No
ambition have I beyond it.”

So he was allowed to go and, even as had been foretold, they took the
> youth captive outside the citadel and brought him before the governor,
> who ordered him blown from the mouth of a cannon. As they bound
> him to the gun, he begged the gunners: “Bind me, I pray you, with my
> face toward the gun that I may see it ﬁred.” Gunners and bystanders alike
> were astonished at his composure and cheerfulness, and indeed one who
> can be cheerful in such a plight must needs have great faith, capacity,
> and fortitude. It is seemly indeed that one be so joyous and jubilant at
> such an hour!

vahíd and the nayríz episodes                                   51

In short, that honored personage [Vahíd] succeeded in eﬀecting his
> departure from the citadel with one other, and set out for Shíráz, and
from there he proceeded to Nayríz.101

After his withdrawal, the governor vanquished his followers. Several [p.120]
> were taken captive and put to death, while from the rest, after they had
> suﬀered divers torments, ﬁnes of money were exacted.

Vahíd’s Arrival at Nayríz

> Now when that honored personage arrived in Nayríz, where his wife
> resided and where he had many friends, many became believers, others
> denied, while still others caviled and remained in doubt. Though formerly
> professing the most devout attachment and humility towards his person,
> no sooner did the district governor perceive that a struggle was imminent
> and the government might slip from his hands, than he sent word to
> him [i.e., Vahíd] saying, “I do not consider it expedient that you should
> continue any longer in this province. It is best that you should depart
> with all speed to some other place.” To this the honored visitor replied,
> “I have returned here, after a prolonged absence, to learn how matters
> fare, and to see my wife and family, neither do I wish to interfere with
> anyone. What makes you order me to quit my house and abode, instead
> of aﬀording me protection, and observing towards me the friendship and
> respect that is my due? Do you not fear God, and have you no shame
before my Ancestor?”

So when the governor saw that he heeded not his words and answered
> him sharply, he was ﬁlled with obstinate spite and strove to raise a tumult,
> inciting such men of every class and kind as were most wicked and mis-
> chievous to make a disturbance and drive out the honored personage. In
> turn Vahíd, perceiving this, repaired to the mosque and after performing
his devotions ascended the pulpit, and thus spoke:

> O people! Am I not he whose opinions you were wont to follow in all
> religious questions? In your needs and trials, as well as in all matters of
> doctrine, practice, and religious tradition were you not wont to prefer my

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh has added the following marginal note in his own hand about Vahíd’s
> visit to Bávanát subsequent to the Shíráz journey: In Bávanát, the Shaykhuʾl-Islám of Mazijan,
> one of the villages of Bávanát, converted, and together they proceeded to Nayríz.

> word to that of any other? Were not my belief and ijtihád102 the criteria
> of all your actions? What has become of you that now you greet me with
> opposition and enmity? What forbidden thing have I sanctioned in the
> pure religion [i.e., Islam], or what lawful thing have I forbidden, that thus
> without reason you charge me with heresy and error? I stand here among
> you wronged and oppressed for no other cause than that I have, for your
> awakening and enlightenment, spoken true words and held faithful discourse,
> and that I have, out of sympathy for you and desire for your welfare, not
> withheld the path of guidance from you. This being so, let each one who
> supports or slights me know of a certainty that howsoever he acts toward
> me, he acts toward my illustrious Ancestor [Muhammad].

> When he had spoken to this eﬀect, some were repentant, and some wept
> bitterly, saying, “We still continue in our former allegiance and devotion
> to you, and all that you say we hold true, right, and most meritorious.”

The Bábí Encampment

> In short, Vahíd came forth from the mosque, quitted the city, and was
> compelled to alight in a ruined castle close by, the friends who bore him
> company being not more than seventeen in number. But even after he
> had left the city, his malicious and mischievous persecutors ceased not
> from their evil designs, for they pursued him with a great throng, scour-
> ing the country in all directions until they discovered his ruined retreat.
> Thereupon, they laid siege to the castle from every side and initiated

good. The rest returned victorious.

At the very time of these events, the exalted Navváb, Prince Farhád
> Mírzá,103 recently appointed governor-general of Fárs, came from the capi-
> tal, Tihrán, to assume the government in Shíráz and was informed of what
> had taken place. He at once collected a considerable military force, which
> he dispatched under the command of Muhammad-ʿAlí Khán Díván-Begí,
> son of Hájí Shukruʾlláh Khán Núrí, and Mustafá-Qulí Khán, commander
of the Qaraguzlú, to subdue and take captive the insurgents.

When this force reached the vicinity of the castle, the number of
> [Vahíd’s] followers had increased to seventy. Several encounters took place
> between the two forces, and on each occasion the friends and companions
> [i.e., the Bábís] routed and dispersed their opponents and obtained pos-
> session of a goodly spoil. And all this while the devotion, faith, and love
> of Vahíd’s companions were much increased by the many victories they
> tasted and the great prodigies he wrought, so that each was fully prepared
> to lay down his life and possessions. He had repeatedly described to his
> companions the circumstances of his own martyrdom, and all had, for
> the good pleasure of the Beloved, washed their hands of life and, quit of
> earthly ties, awaited martyrdom.

Deceiving the Bábís

> Those who had come to take them being unable, notwithstanding all their
> eﬀorts, to prevail by force of arms, and despairing of the ﬁnal issue, opened
> the door of treachery and deceit, and sent a missive before the illustrious
> Vahíd expressing perplexity as to his Cause, making excuses for past deeds,
> declaring themselves desirous of inquiring into the matter, and begging
> for instruction. They further pledged, with oaths sworn upon the Word
> of God [i.e., the Qurʾán], that if he would be good enough to come out
to meet them, they would obey whatever terms he might propose.

So, out of respect for the sacred Qurʾán, which bore their seal, Vahíd

> Because of what they have written and pledged themselves on the Qurʾán

bitter weeping.

So that honored personage came to the warring camp and there alighted.

> [At ﬁrst] the commanders treated him with all due respect and deference,

[p.130] gone forth from his tent, the sentinels prevented him, saying, “It is not
permitted you to go out.” So he remained a prisoner in the tent.

No sooner had tidings of this reached his faithful followers than,
> unable to restrain themselves, they emerged from their castle, hurled
> themselves upon the center of the army, and, in a short time, threw the
> whole camp into confusion. The senior oﬃcers seeing this, hastened into

your suggestions.”

That honored personage had no recourse but to write to his followers,
> “Come what may, you must submit to divinely ordained decrees; and

> own possessions, leaving the spoils you have won exactly as they are, and

Vahíd’s Martyrdom

> There was with the venerable Vahíd a certain believer of Yazd107 who had
> served him faithfully both at Yazd and Nayríz, suﬀering much in the path
> of his master’s good pleasure and attaining the exalted station of servitude
> and true recognition of the Lord by renouncing all earthly possessions.
> And when word was brought that the executioner was on his way from
> the city [i.e., Shíráz] charged with the killing of that illustrious Siyyid
> [Yahyá], this man began to make great lamentation. But his master said,
> “It is you, not me, whom this headsman shall slay; he who shall slay me
will arrive tomorrow.”

When the morrow came, he performed the morning obligatory prayer,
> and an hour later, he said again, “He who is to slay me is now come.”
> Shortly after this, a party of farrashes arrived and led out that honored
> person and the Yazdí from the tent. Then the executioner, just as Vahíd
> had foretold, administered to the youth the draught of martyrdom. When

> before the face of God’s Messenger and will never lift my hand to slay
> His oﬀspring,” neither would he, for all their importuning, consent to
do their bidding.

Then one who had lost two brothers in the earlier part of the war, and
therefore cherished a deep resentment, said, “I will kill him.” And he

Captives Taken to Shíráz

And they sent an announcement of their victory and triumph to Prince
[p.135] Farhád [sic] Mírzá, and ﬁxed a day for their entry into Shíráz. And when

strains of guitars and lutes. Thus wondering I entered the city.

Thus they brought the illustrious captives into the bazaars, which had

> as to the names and family of the captives, and throwing in an occasional,
> “Who is this?” and “Which is that?” And all the captives were women, with
the exception of one child ﬁve years of age who was with them.

After that, those illustrious beings were excused from the presence [of the

> back to the time of Karím Khán Zand.

Second Nayríz Episode

> Hemmed in as they were, that wronged-band began defenses and won

and the siege of the mountain from all directions lasted for a long time.

Often would a company of seven or nineteen men come down from the
> mountain with cries of “Yá Sahibuʾz-Zamán!” attack a battery, cut down
> the gunners, capture the gun, and bear it away with them to the moun-
> tain, where they would mount it on a tree trunk and ﬁre it morning and
> evening against the camp. At other times they would make night-attacks
> on certain suburbs of Nayríz inhabited by enemies and opponents, and
> return safely. [At such times] none could withstand them, nor do aught
but choose between submission and ﬂight.

Now Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín Khán, the governor of Nayríz, had taken the chief
> part in bringing about all these troubles. He it was who had compassed
> the death of the much-wronged Áqá Siyyid Yahyá in the ﬁrst war; he it
> was who devised most of the stratagems, tactics, dispositions, and arrange-

> provoked strife for the sake of securing his position as governor and win-
> ning approval from the government; he it was, in short, who had driven
> away [the Bábís] from their homes and possessions, and caused them
> with their wives and families to be beleaguered in the mountains. So one
> day when this honorable governor had gone to the bath, the illustrious
insurgents attacked the bath and slew him.113

But reinforcements of men and artillery sent in rapid succession by the
> Navváb Tahmasp Mírzá, the Muʿayyaduʾd-Dawlih, who at that time was
> the governor-general of Fárs, continued to arrive from Shíráz and occupy
> the rising ground adjoining the mountain. Still, notwithstanding the great-

> venture to ascend the mountain in an attack. Even in their camp they
> were ill at ease because of the night-attacks and sudden onslaughts made
> upon them by very small parties of the friends [i.e., the Bábís]. These,

> slay the gunners, and return, pushing the guns with their shoulders, until

So when the royalist troops saw that they could eﬀect nothing, they

tribesmen, and others. These ascended the mountain on every side.

> dispersed, while the regular troops broke up their camp, and, carrying
> with them their prisoners, and the severed heads of the men, set out for
Shíráz, which in due course they reached.

In accordance with the instruction of the central authorities, the heads

CHAPTER SIX

THE HOUSEHOLD OF HUJJAT

> After a while, consistent with the instruction of the Qájár sovereign, [p.145:10]
> the captives of Zanjan, that is, the household of the illustrious Akhúnd
> Mullá Muhammad-ʿAlí Zanjání, [surnamed] Hujjat,117 who were previ-
> ously destined for Tihrán, were now ordered to be sent to Shíráz. Bíbí
> Ruqiyyih, the eldest daughter of the illustrious Hujjat, related the details
of this episode for this servant thus:

> After thirteen months during which the much-wronged party [i.e., the Bábís]
> had battled the government’s army, one morning Hujjat summoned his entire
> household into his presence. These included his three wives, two of whom
> were permanent, while one was contracted,118 and she did not have a child.
> One of the permanent wives was our mother who had six children, that
> is, ﬁve daughters and a son: Bíbí Ruqiyyih, Bíbí Sarih, Bíbí Fátimih, Bíbí
> Saﬃyih, Bíbí Hamidiyh, and Mírzá Husayn. The other permanent wife had
> a two-year-old son named Ahmad119 who was held closely at his mother’s
> bosom. We all attained our father’s presence where we were exhorted with
words to this eﬀect:

> You must endeavor to distinguish yourselves over the other people and
> in no wise should you be like the rest. You must possess chastity, purity,
> piety, detachment, religion, and trustworthiness. Your deeds must bear
> witness to the nobility of being a believer and a companion of the Qáʾim.
> Should your conduct be such that the One Exalted God will be well
> pleased with you, my spirit will also rejoice and be glad. My martyrdom
> is certain. They will martyr me. After me, each of you many choose either
> martyrdom or captivity, and the Lord will assuredly grant your desire.

He spoke at length in this manner. The younger wife who had an infant
> child replied, “I wish martyrdom so that in whichever of God’s worlds
> you dwell, I would be with you.” He replied, “Since you desire and aspire
> martyrdom, be conﬁdent that such will be your destiny.”

Lit., The Proof, one of the formal titles of the Báb. Toward the latter part of His
> life, the Báb bestowed some of His own titles on His chief disciples. For instance, in 1848
He bestowed the title of “Hadrat-i Aʿlá” (His Holiness the Exalted One) on Quddús.

Islamic jurisprudence allows for four permanent wives and any number of concu-
bines. The latter do not typically enjoy the same status as the former.

Nabíl Aʿzam, The Dawn-Breakers, p. 578, gives his name as Mihdí and suggests
that he died in Shíráz.

Our mother made reply, “Captivity has a greater station since the House-
> hold of the Prophet, that is, the wife and the descendants of the Prince
> of Martyrs [i.e., Imám Husayn] were seized and taken from town to town
> and land to land, and, therefore, I desire enslavement.” “Imprisonment is
> decreed as your fortune and that of your children,” Hujjat answered. He
> then added, “Today is my last day in this transient world. I ask that after
> my martyrdom, you bury me in my clothes by the threshold of this room
and place all your reliance in the Divine Sovereignty.”

After his utterances concluded, a cannonball shot by the enemies broke
> through the room and instantly martyred the younger wife and the child at
> her bosom. Hujjat instructed that she and her infant be buried at the same
> spot. Shortly thereafter, another bullet came through and took his own life.
> In accordance with his instructions, the companions interred his remains
> by the room’s entrance. When the enemies learned that his holiness [Huj-
> jat] was martyred, they surrounded the camp and seized all the remaining
> followers. Then they searched for his body. Finding the spot where he had
[p.150]         been buried, they exhumed the remains and, cutting oﬀ his ﬁnger, removed
a ring he wore.120

Thereafter, they apprehended all of us—a group that consisted of ﬁve
> sisters and my brother, together with our mother and our father’s concubine
> wife—and plundered all our possessions and seized our properties. Having
> completed these, they readied camels previously belonging to our family, and,
> accompanied by caravan-masters, they compelled us to mount the camels. In
> utmost misery, we were conducted in such wise from Zanjan to Tihrán.

> Upon arrival at Tihrán, the Qájár monarch was informed of the manner
> in which they were made captive and conducted to the capital. The Sháh
> ordered that the prisoners must not remain in Tihrán but instead panniers
> be prepared for their delivery to Fárs in a digniﬁed and beﬁtting manner.
> Subsequent to the Sháh’s command, panniers with exquisite covers were
> readied and several attendants assigned to their service. In this manner

CHAPTER SEVEN

CONVERSION OF THE FAMILY OF THE BÁB

> After the martyrdom of His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb]—may [p.153:7]
> the spirit of all else be a sacriﬁce unto Him—and subsequent to the events
> and troubles of Tihrán, which surely have been recorded in the history
> of that city, on the ﬁfth day of Jamáduʾl-Avval AH 1269 [14 February
> 1853],127 the Blessed Perfection [Baháʾuʾlláh]—exalted be His mention and
> praise—arrived at the Abode of Peace [i.e., Baghdad]. Through trusted
> emissaries, He commenced sending mighty Tablets to various parts and
> corners of Iran bearing His sacred insignia, 152, which is the number
> of Bahá.128

Conversion of Núriʾd-Dín

> One such Tablet was revealed in honor of the exalted leaf [Khadíjih
> Bagum], the wife of His Holiness the Exalted One, in Fárs. At that time,
> no one in the Afnán family was among the believers, and consequently
> none were in the conﬁdence of the illustrious wife [of the Báb]. As such,
> she began to speak and teach the present writer’s father, Áqá Mírzá Áqá
> Afnán,129 whom the Ancient Beauty in a splendid Tablet designated thus:
> “We have named thee at this moment, Núriʾd-Dín [the light of ].”130

Shoghi Eﬀendi, God Passes By, p. 109, and Balyúzí, Baháʾuʾlláh the King of Glory,
p. 106, state that Baháʾuʾlláh arrived in Baghdad on 8 April 1853.

According to the abjad system, the numerical values of the three letters composing
the word Bahá (B, H, and A) are 2, 5, and 1, respectively.

For a biography see, Balyúzí, Eminent Baháʾís in the Time of Baháʾuʾlláh, pp. 216–36.

(original Text in INBMC 51:323, no. 326, and Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, p. 201):

> Afnán. The honored Mírzá Áqá, upon him rest the Glory of God!
He is God, exalted is He, the Lord of Majesty and Grandeur.

> O My Afnán! Upon thee rest My Glory, My Bounty, and My Favor.

Verily, the Servant-in-Attendance [i.e., Mírzá Áqá Ján, Baháʾuʾlláh’s amanuensis]

At that time Núriʾd-Dín was thirteen131 years of age and was her nephew.

> They engaged in discussion about the Cause, and shortly thereafter he
> embraced the Faith. The sacred breath of the illustrious wife [of the
> Báb] penetrated his being in such wise that even from a young age he
> was consumed with profound zeal and devotion, and was uncontrollably
[p.155] propelled to teach the Faith with utmost courage and audacity.

Initially, he taught [the new Theophany to] his own father, Áqá Mírzá
> Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín, who was close to the late Áqá Mír Muhammad-Ridá,
> the Báb’s father, and was his paternal cousin. Having eﬀected the spiritual
> conversion of his father, he turned his attention to his mother, [Zahrá
> Bagum], as she was a sister of the wife [Khadíjih Bagum], and she gave
> submission to the new religion as well. Thus his condition was eased
within his immediate household.

My late father forwarded supplications to the sanctiﬁed presence [of
> Baháʾuʾlláh] in the Abode of Peace, and in response was honored with
> mighty Tablets in the sacred hand of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá. These Tablets are
> currently kept in a special container. Divine benevolence thus embraced
him.132

At that time, two requests for attainment unto His sanctiﬁed pres-
> ence were sent [to Baháʾuʾlláh]: one from my late father, Áqá Mírzá Áqá
> Núriʾd-Dín, and the other from his father, the late Áqá Mírzá Zaynuʾl-
> ʿAbidín. In response, two separate wondrous and hallowed Tablets in the
> blessed hand of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá were revealed [by Baháʾuʾlláh]. In reply to
> the late Áqá Mírzá Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín’s request, after bestowing great favors
> upon him, it was written, “Thou hast requested permission to attain Our
> presence. Before this Tablet reacheth thee, thou wilt have reached Us.”133

And in response to my late father’s missive, again after showering him

> Núriʾd-Dín. We beseech God that He may ordain for thee that which will draw
> thee nigh unto Him and be of proﬁt to thee. He, verily, is the All-Gracious, the
All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

My aﬀection rest upon thee and those that are with thee who hear thy voice in
this mighty Cause.

The original text states “eleven,” however, someone, possibly the author, has crossed
> it out and written “thirteen” over it. Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúruʾl-Haqq, vol. 6, p. 856,
> gives Núriʾd-Dín’s age at the time of conversion as 11 years old. Since the latter source
> has heavily relied on Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh’s account for its information on Fárs, it suggests
that Fádil Mázandarání had an early copy of this manuscript in his possession.

As described in the preface, at ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s bidding, Núriʾd-Dín prepared a col-
> lection of Baháʾuʾlláh’s Tablets revealed in his honor and sent a copy to the Holy Land.
This densely written compilation is more than 161 pages long.

> with immense bounties, it was revealed in Arabic, “Thou hast requested
> permission to come before Us, but know that thou wilt be honored with
this in the course of the next Manifestation.”134

By the time that these sacred Tablets were received, Áqá Mírzá Zaynuʾl-
> ʿAbidín had passed away, and the meaning of His sanctiﬁed Person [i.e.,
> Baháʾuʾlláh] became evident and clear, as he had reached the Beloved
> before the Tablet had reached him. My late father, however, would often
> remark that he was most puzzled by the statement, “. . . in the course of

Conversion of the Great Uncle of the Báb

> After having conﬁrmed his parents, my father commenced discussion with
> the illustrious Khál, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad. One day a group of
> the friends were in his [Núriʾd-Dín’s] presence, and my brothers and this
> servant were in attendance as well, and he thus recalled his discussions
with the honored Khál:

> At the beginning when I broached the subject with the illustrious Khál, he
> would persistently refuse, and yet I would put forth more evidences and
> proofs [in support of the Báb’s claim]. It proceeded in such wise for several
meetings.136

One day in the course of our discussion I was strenuously enumerating
> proofs when, with great amazement, he exclaimed, “Áqá Mírzá Áqá, are
> you saying that my Nephew is the Qáʾim of the House of Muhammad?”
> “And what if He is?” I responded. Thoroughly astounded, he rejoiced,
> “That would be most extraordinary,” to which I replied, “There is nothing
strange about it!”

[From this comment,] he became most reﬂective. Considering his condi-
> tion, I smiled. He asked, “Why do you laugh?” At ﬁrst, I refused to answer
> and replied, “It might not be polite on my part, and therefore it is best for
> me not to say.” However, he insisted, “Do not be reticent and say [what
> you are thinking].” “Now that you wish,” I responded, “I will share. The
> objection that your exalted self now raised is the very one that Abu-Lahab137

Núriʾd-Dín attained the presence of Baháʾuʾlláh after His Declaration and the
inauguration of the Baháʾí Faith.

Letters of the Khál Akbar written upon the Báb’s return from the hajj journey and

> The Almighty is well able to have appointed your Nephew as the Qáʾim of
the House of Muhammad. ‘The Hand of God is free.’ ”

Then, the honored Khál responded, “The light of mine eye! What an
> irrefutable answer! There is no further room for objection. What am I to
> do now?” I said to him, “This is what you ought to do: First, it is obliga-
> tory upon you to go on pretext of pilgrimage to the ʿAtabát and there to
> visit your exalted sister, (namely, the mother of His Holiness [the Báb], as
> after the news of the Martyrdom she proceeded to the ʿAtabát and resided

responded, “Not a bad idea. Your words have penetrated my heart.”139

He wrote his [youngest] brother, Hájí Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí, who at that
> time was a merchant in Yazd, “I intend to visit the ʿAtabát and meet our
> exalted sister. Should you wish to join in, come to Shíráz so we may journey

> stand ready to join you on this pilgrimage. Kindly remain in Shíráz until
my arrival, and thereupon we will travel to the ʿAtabát.”

Therefore, the honored Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad commenced
> preparation for the journey and awaited the arrival of Hájí Mírzá Hasan-

> and have no wish to hear of such discussions.” That very day, Hájí Mírzá
Hasan-ʿAlí departed [from Baghdad].

The esteemed Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad remained behind and tried
> to meet with the venerable Hájí Siyyid Javád Karbaláʾí, whose good name
> was mentioned earlier in this history. Upon their encounter, he informed the
> latter, “The purpose of my journey to the Abode of Peace is to meet with

> to His blessed Person and attain His presence, kindly request permission and
> ask for an appointment [that I may gain His presence].” In light of their
> long friendship and association, the honored Hájí Siyyid Javád, who was at
> that time a believer and conﬁrmed, was deeply moved with the Khál’s stated
purpose and expressed his profound joy and felicitation over this matter.

Thereupon, he attained the presence of the Blessed Beauty and stated, “The
> honored Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad, the second Khál of His Holiness
> the Exalted One [the Báb]—may the spirit of all else be a sacriﬁce unto
> Him—has come from Shíráz to the Abode of Peace and wishes to gain the
> bliss of Your presence. Would permission be granted?” Out of divine favor
> and grace, [Baháʾuʾlláh] expressed His joy and ﬁxed the hour of the meeting
and granted permission.

At the appointed time, together with Hájí Siyyid Javád, he [the uncle
> of the Báb] attained His presence and was surrounded with His immense
> blessing, at which time he shared his understanding regarding the issue of
> the appearance of the Qáʾim, the prophecies [associated with this event],

> then, as a grace upon all, He said, “Commit to paper all that you have in

will be written as well.”

On hearing this, the honored Khál was exceedingly happy because of
> His benevolence and that very night wrote in detail the complex questions
> he had in mind regarding the appearance and the proofs of the promised
> Qáʾim and presented these queries.141

> In response, the sacred Kitáb-i Íqán was revealed in the honor of the Khál

Khál’s Return to Shíráz

> The friends came to meet the illustrious Khál and to receive spiritual
sustenance from him. The late Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán related:

> Upon attaining the presence of the Khál, with the greatest aﬀection he

prayed for me from the depths of his heart.

I asked, “Kindly grant me permission to speak also with your honored sons

> that circles the candle in adoration, they gathered around him. At ﬁrst,
Nabíl spoke with great wisdom. My late father related:

> One morning, the honored Nabíl said to me, “Bid the entire body of believ-

> they possess. You bring all the Writings in your tenure as well, as I wish to
> segregate them. I have a particular charge that I must announce and desire
to leave Shíráz shortly, as I must travel for other territories.”

Congruent with Nabíl’s request, I informed the friends to assemble in
> the home of the late Áqá Mírzá ʿAbduʾl-Karím149 and emphasized especially
> that they bring with them all the Writings and Tablets that were in their
[p.170]               possession. At the appointed hour, the friends congregated, bringing the

Under the events of 1283 AH/1866, Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúruʾl-Haqq, vol. 5, p. 3,
> states: “Mullá Muhammad Zarandí (Nabíl Aʿzam), wearing the garb of dervishes, and
> Mírzá Munír Kashání, Mírzá Ahmad, and Mírzá Jaʿfar Yazdí, and some others, were
> charged with travelling throughout Iran and ‘Iraq to teach the Cause of Baháʾuʾlláh,
wining over the Bábís.”

Nabíl’s own travel diary indicates that he arrived in Shíráz from Ardistán. A summary
> of Nabíl’s travels from the time of Baháʾuʾlláh’s Declaration in April 1863 until Nabíl’s
> arrival in Shíráz is as follows: Nabíl arrived in Baghdad in time for Naw-Rúz 1863 and
> participated in the celebrations at the Garden of Ridván. Upon Baháʾuʾlláh’s departure
> from Baghdad, Nabíl remained behind for 19 days, but joined the Holy Caravan in
> mid-July 1863. He remained with Baháʾuʾlláh until December of that year, when he was
> sent to teach the Cause in ‘Iraq and Iran. He eventually reached Baghdad by Naw-Rúz
> of 1864, then traveled in the western and central parts of Iran, and eventually returned
> to Baháʾuʾlláh in Edirnih. Once more, he was sent to Iran for the propagation of the
> Baháʾí Faith. In the winter of 1866, while in Tihrán, he saw a copy of the Surih Asháb
> as well as a Tablet addressed to himself and learned that it was time to widely teach the
> Bábís about the appearance of the Promised One of the Bayán, namely, Baháʾuʾlláh. He
> proceeded to Khurásán and in a meeting with the believers in Mashhad, threw the writings
> of Yahyá Azal in the ﬁre and thus invited them to embrace the Faith of Baháʾuʾlláh. He
> then proceeded to Yazd, Ardikán, and when he arrived in Naʾín, he learned in a newly
> arrived Tablet that Baháʾuʾlláh had titled him, Nabíl Aʿzam. He went to Ardistán where
> he received the text of the two Tablets of Hajj and learned that he was to perform these
> rites. He proceeded immediately to Shíráz by way of Isfahán for the fulﬁllment of this
> important mission and further teaching of the Baháʾí Faith. He reached Shíráz in the fall
of 1866 (See Vahid Raʾfati, “Nabíl Aʿzam Zarandí,” 5:33–36).

Before anything else, as bidden by Baháʾuʾlláh, Nabíl preformed the rites of the
> obligatory pilgrimage (hajj). Nabíl knew the Afnán family from his visit in 1279 AH/1862
> when he had arrived in time for the marriage of Mírzá Buzurg<15> (Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán,
private communications, August 1994).

Better known as Kilíd-Dár [the key-keeper or the caretaker] he had been the cus-
todian of Sháh-Chiráq.

> Tablets and Writings. After partaking of tea, the venerable Nabíl gathered
> all the Writings and read each with great care. All the papers and Tablets
were separated into three stacks and set apart from each other.

Nabíl then announced, “The ﬁrst group are the Tablets of His Holiness
> the Exalted One [the Báb]—may the spirit of all else be a sacriﬁce unto
> Him.” He placed these on the ﬂoor and picked up another batch, saying,
> “These are the Writings of ‘Him Whom God shall make manifest’—may
> His mention be exalted—the very Person whose Advent was promised by
> His Holiness the Exalted One to the concourse of the Bayán, making the
> acceptance or rejection of all that He had revealed dependent upon His
> good pleasure. With greatest clarity, He established a Covenant, declaring,
> ‘O people of the Bayán! Be vigilant, for the appearance of Him Whom
> God shall manifest is nigh. Beware lest the Bayán and all that is therein
> may shut you out from His Manifestation.’ ‘The Bayán is but a leaf before
> Him. Were He to deign accept it, it would be of His grace. And were He
> to reject it, it would be but a sign of His justice.’ In another passage, the
> time of His blessed appearance was ﬁxed with precision, ‘In the year nine
> ye will attain unto all good.’150 ‘He will proclaim His Cause and invite all
> the people and the followers of the Bayán to the ridván of the His divine
> recognition. Whosoever accepts Him, is reckoned among the dwellers of
> paradise. And whosoever rejects Him, is of the people of hellﬁre and by
> ﬁre they shall perish.’ This third group are the polemic papers151 and are
> unworthy of consideration.” He then picked up the third group of papers
and threw them into the stove where a ﬁre was burning.

[Upon this pronouncement,] a tumult was stirred among the friends. For
> instance, greatly agitated, the honored Khál, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad,
> vociferously protested, “What manner of scheme is this? What sort of talks
> are these? Do you take faith to be like a weed; you cut it in daytime, and
> it grows again during the night?” In similar manner, many objected [to
what Nabíl had advanced].

It was then that I [intervened and] spoke calmly to the Khál, stating,
> “Of a certainty, we must investigate and determine the actual truth of the
> situation. A mighty claim such as this must surely be true, for none save
> the True One has the temerity to advance such an assertion. Consider the
> time when His Holiness the Exalted One—gloriﬁed be His mention—was
> in Shíráz and proclaimed His divine mission. Was He not the Truth, and
> was He not sent by the One Exalted God to guide mankind? How was
> it, then, that everyone rejected Him, vast multitudes rose in opposition to

Arabic Bayán, cited by Baháʾuʾlláh in Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 141.

Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúruʾl-Haqq, vol. 6, p. 857, suggests the writings of Azal
were meant.

Truth, there is naught but waywardness.’ ”152

After hearing such reasoning, the illustrious Khál grew reﬂective and
> responded, “We must thoroughly investigate this matter, as religion is not
a trivial matter.”

In this way, on that day, the dispute among the believers was reduced,
and the esteemed Nabíl was able to proceed towards Isfahán.

> God shall manifest,” namely, the Blessed Beauty—gloriﬁed and exalted

Opposition of Shaykh Muhammad

My father further related:

> There was a certain Shaykh Muhammad Yazdí in Shíráz who was a believer in
> His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb] and prior to the Declaration of the
> Blessed Beauty would always say, “The Promised One of the Bayán, namely,
> ‘Him Whom God shall manifest,’ can be none other than Baháʾuʾlláh.” The
[p.175]         believers were particularly disturbed with such talk and were determined to

> harm him in some way. Often, they would come to me, complaining, “Please
> allow us to injure Shaykh Muhammad, as it is now only the beginning of the
> Dispensation, and he is raising matters that will cause diﬀerences. Indeed,
> he is planting seeds of division and rancor.” I would admonish them to
> calmness and respond, “It is best for you not to heed such comments and
> to leave him to himself. No one, as yet, has advanced a claim, and Shaykh
> Muhammad is welcome to speak as he wishes.” In short, I would endeavor
to ﬁnd ways to quiet the friends.

It went thus until the honored Nabíl arrived and announced the Cause
> [of Baháʾuʾlláh], and all the believers readily accepted and embraced the
> straight path, except for the aforementioned Shaykh Muhammad who raised
> the standard of hesitation. With great energy he would resist this announce-
> ment and say, “There is no truth to such a claim. The promise of the Bayán
> remains unﬁlled, and we must await the coming of year ‘Ghíyáth’ and the

> ‘Mustagháth.’154 The Bayánic Era has not concluded, and the Bayánic laws
> have not been promulgated or implemented. Therefore, how could they be
abrogated [so swiftly]?”

This manner of talk was particularly disagreeable and oﬀensive to the
> friends, and they unanimously resolved to slay Shaykh Muhammad and
> destroy him altogether. They came to me and asked for permission, “Prior
> to [Baháʾuʾlláh’s] Declaration, this man would maintain that the Promised

repudiates the Truth must be chastised.”

The friends were particularly happy with this response and left determined

See, the Persian Bayán 2:17 and 3:15. For a summary translation, consult Momen,

> tagháth (he who is called up for help) have numerical values of 1511 and 2001, respectively.
> The followers of Mírzá Yahyá erroneously interpreted this to mean that the Promised One
> of the Bayán was to appear in two millennia. It is clear from the text of the Persian Bayán,
> however, that the Promised One would appear before the expiration of Mustagháth (2001
> years) and not at such a date. Baháʾuʾlláh (Gleanings, p. 50) explains this further: “Shake
> oﬀ, O heedless ones, the slumber of negligence, that ye may behold the radiance which
> His glory hath spread through the world. How foolish are those who murmur against the
> premature birth of His light. O ye who are inly blind! Whether too soon or too late, the
> evidences of His eﬀulgent glory are now actually manifest. It behoveth you to ascertain
> whether or not such a light hath appeared. It is neither within your power nor mine to
> set the time at which it should be made manifest. God’s inscrutable Wisdom hath ﬁxed
its hour beforehand.”

The tone of the original text implies that while, in order to pacify the believers,
> Núriʾd-Dín had consented to the murder of Shaykh Muhammad, yet secretly he had
informed the latter of what was to occur.

Balyúzí, Eminent Baháʾís in the Time of Baháʾuʾlláh, p. 227, states that Shaykh
> Muhammad proceeded to Istanbul where he joined with principal Azalis and caused great
> mischief. A more detailed outline of his activities is provided by Baháʾuʾlláh (INBMC
> 51:524–25, no. 517) where it is noted that together with Yahyá Azal, he committed many
> misdeeds. In a Tablet dated 21 Safar 1307 AH/23 October 1889 to Núriʾd-Dín in Port
> Said, Baháʾuʾlláh refers to him as “Shaykh Muhammad Kadhdháb [the liar]” (Núriʾd-Dín

Conversion of the Remaining Kinsmen

> After the departure of the honored Nabíl, Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán endeavored
> to teach and proclaim the blessed Cause, and was successful in conﬁrming
> a number of seekers. During this period, he taught his maternal cousins,
> Áqá Siyyid Muhammad-Husayn and Áqá [Siyyid] Mírzá Abúʾl-Hasan, the
> sons of the illustrious Afnán, the late Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim<11>. He
> would take them with him to various meetings and exert much eﬀort in
renewing their spirit.

Some days ago, this servant was in the presence of my distinguished
> maternal uncle, Áqá Siyyid Muhammad-Husayn<37>, and asked him
concerning the way he had found the Faith:

> Repeatedly, your father, the honored Áqá Mírzá Áqá, who was a paternal
> cousin of mine, would speak about this Cause with my brother Áqá Mírzá
> Abúʾl-Hasan and me, and share the Divine Words. He would also take us to
> various gatherings, especially the ones held at the home of Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí-
> Akbar Sábir. We attended several such meetings and heard the Sacred Verses.
> However, as we were of the same age as your father and were related to him,
we did not much heed his eﬀorts, though we would hold our tongues.

After some time, the honored Hájí Muhammad-Ibráhím Yazdí, the
> Muballigh,159 arrived in Shíráz from Yazd. Your father took advantage of
> the opportunity and aligned the venerable Muballigh in this purpose with
> himself, and together they endeavored to teach and edify us. Out of the
> divine grace and through the conﬁrmations from on High, we were able to
> recognize the Truth and embraced the Faith as believers.

> In like manner the whole of the Afnán family in Shíráz accepted the Faith.
Blessings be upon them and may their end be well!

My late father would relate: “During the time that the honored Hájí
Muhammad-Ibráhím tarried in Shíráz and taught the Faith, a large num-

The sole exception in Fárs was the community of Hindijan where one of the Bábís,

to establish a Baháʾí community there.

> In this regard Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán, who would also assist them with
> ﬁnancial support, encouraged them. All meetings and gatherings were
held in the residence of the esteemed Afnán.

In short, after his sojourn in Shíráz, the honored Muballigh returned
> to Yazd. The reason for his departure was that his stay in Shíráz became
> broadly known, and the meddlesome characters were informed, resulting
> in the ʿulamá pursuing the matter. Troubles seemed imminent, and it
> was therefore decided best for him to quit the city. My late father would
relate:

> Several times, I emphasized to the honored Muballigh, “Once you have
> regained Yazd, kindly speak with the Afnáns residing in that city so that
> haply they would become believers in the Faith as well.” Since the esteemed
> Hájí Muhammad-Ibráhím was related to our Yazdí family, that is, his sister
> [Hájíyyih Bíbí Gawhar] had married Hájí Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí, a maternal
> uncle of His Holiness the Exalted One—may my spirit be a sacriﬁce unto
Him—he was a conﬁdant to the family.

Upon arrival in Yazd, in accordance with my request, he commenced
> discussions with the Afnán, that is, Hájí Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid
> Hasan, [surnamed] Afnán Kabír, and their sons.161 As the scions were young
> and less fanatical, they hastened to embrace the Faith. However, despite of
> the Muballigh’s eﬀorts, Hájí Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí refused to recognize at that
> time and stated, “I will accept only if Áqá Mírzá Siyyid Hasan, who is our
> superior in the realm of divine knowledge, would also assent and recognize.”
> That is, he allowed the honored Áqá Mírzá Siyyid Hasan to become his
spiritual lens and conditioned his acceptance upon the latter’s.

After the greatest of eﬀorts and troubles, ﬁnally Áqá Mírzá Siyyid Hasan
> accepted the Faith, and immediately thereafter, the honored Khál, Hájí
> Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí, embraced the Cause as well.

> In such wise, none among this distinguished family, whether male or
> female, remained deprived of the blessing of recognition.

For some unexplained reason, Balyúzí, Eminent Baháʾís in the Time of Baháʾuʾlláh,
p. 224, has placed these events some years earlier, closer to 1863.

Balyúzí, Eminent Baháʾís in the Time of Baháʾuʾlláh, p. 229, states that in accordance
> with the instructions of Baháʾuʾlláh, Mullá Muhammad Nabíl Akbar had also arrived in
> Yazd to teach the Baháʾí Faith, and he joined forces with the Muballigh.

During the time that I tarried in Cairo, Egypt, one day the illustrious

CHAPTER EIGHT

FIRST BAHÁʾÍ MARTYRS OF SHÍRÁZ IN 1871

> After the departure of Hájí Muhammad-Ibráhím [Muballigh] from Shíráz, [p.183:11]
> the admired Nabíl Akbar, that is, Mullá Muhammad Qáʾiní, arrived here.
> He stayed for thirteen months in Shíráz, and his residence was the home
> of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán. During this time, he was engaged in teaching
> and serving [the Baháʾí Faith] and was able to convert a large number [of
> seekers to the Baháʾí Faith] and to renew their spirits.162

The Intercession of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk

> Among the incidents that occurred during this period in Shíráz and
> caused disturbance for the friends was the bitter dispute and conﬂict
> between Mírzá Abúʾl-Hasan Khán, the Mushíruʾl-Mulk [II],163 and Mírzá
> ʿAlí-Muhammad Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk [II].164 Since the Mushíruʾl-
> Mulk was a vizier [of the province] and the Qavámuʾl-Mulk performed
> the oﬃces of Kalántar [police] and Biglar-bayki [provincial mayor], the
believers became pawns in their contentions.

The Mushír’s intent was to cause revolt and unrest throughout the realm,
> in the hope that it would engulf [his opponent] the Qavám. In whatever
> town he arrived, the Mushír would compile a list of the believers and [p.185]
> forward it to the governor-general. Further, he would incite the ʿulamá
> and urge them to perpetrate various evils. Several times, he precipitated
such disturbances and injuries.

Eventually, in AH 1283 [1866], during the governorship of Sultán-
Murád Mírzá, the Hisámuʾs-Saltanih,165 he prepared a list of the believers

Balyúzí, Eminent Baháʾís in the Time of Baháʾuʾlláh, p. 229, indicates that Hájí Mírzá

the Afnán family.

He inherited the title after the passing of his father.

The fourth son of Hájí ʿAlí-Akbar Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk I, he was born in 1829

> and in 1865, after the passing of his father, assumed his title and position. Among the

water to the city. He passed away at the age of 56.

This list was given [by the Mushír] to the Qájár Prince Hisámu’s-

> and of a certainty, I expect these men [on the list] to be brought before
me by tomorrow.”

Noting the fury of the Prince, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk had remained silent

Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúruʾl-Haqq, vol. 6, pp. 859–60, gives his name as Muham-
mad, which most likely is a misreading of “Mashhadí.”

For one instance of such designation, see Baháʾuʾlláh’s Tablet to Núriʾd-Dín in Port

> explain in detail the character of these personages and to introduce them
properly.” “Proceed without any hesitation,” the Prince replied.

The Qavámuʾl-Mulk responded, “First, these people who have been
> enumerated on the list are not ordinary citizens. Hájí Mírzá Siyyid
> Muhammad, Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim, and some others are among the
> distinguished merchants of the city. The rest are also noble, righteous
> men and are among the Bazaar’s trustworthy shopkeepers. What has been
> reported to the exalted Navváb [Prince] may not be true about them.”
> “Introduce them more fully so that we would be better informed of their
condition,” the Prince ordered.

The Qavám then commenced to tell of each in more detail, “Hájí Mírzá
> Siyyid Muhammad<5> is a merchant, and Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí
> and Hájí Mírzá Buzurg are his two sons. Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim Saqá-
> Khánih<11> is a renowned merchant and has attained your presence on
> a number of occasions. During the ʿAshurá commemorations, from the
> tenth of the month [of Muharram], he initiates rawdih-khání ceremo-
> nies and gives alms by which a multitude of merchants, shopkeepers,
> and the needy are fed. If you kindly recall, during the last ʿAshurá, the
> Mushíruʾl-Mulk and this servant were in your esteemed company when
> we went to his [Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim’s] home, and you lit a candle
> by the pulpit and greatly praised his eﬀorts. You spoke at length of the
> elegance his house, of the gathering, of the abundance of the worshippers,
> and especially of the Hájí himself.169 You stated, ‘In truth, this Siyyid is
> most distinguished, digniﬁed, and benevolent toward the citizens.’ The
> Hájí insisted for you to partake of dinner, but you did not accept. Áqá
> Mírzá Áqá is a nephew and son-in-law of Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim. These [p.190]
> are not commonplace people whom, because of certain men’s animosity,
> we could arrest and cause disturbance in the city. Should your good self
> ever decide on their apprehension, I would ﬁrst resign my oﬃce as the
> city’s Kalántar and Biglar-bayki and would quit town before seeing such
> an order carried out, since I do not wish to be responsible for the events
that may transpire.”

On hearing the Qavámuʾl-Mulk speak thus and learning of the back-
> ground of the individuals on the list, the Prince was moved deeply and
> in astonishment remarked, “Hide this list and do not comment regard-
> ing this matter to anyone. We no longer desire any disturbance for these
> merchants and Siyyids, but wish to have the others brought before us.”

Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim was a very wealthy merchant.

The Imprisonment of Believers

> For a while such talk subsided, until a second event occurred causing once
> again the ﬁre of hostility to glow brightly. The following description of that
event is based on what my father, Áqá Mírzá Áqá [Núriʾd-Dín], related:

> The wife of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Rikáb-Sáz170 was a particularly rancorous and
> spiteful woman. The more that wronged-one tried to edify his wife and
> instill certitude in her, the less eﬀect it had, and day-by-day she grew in
> enmity and hostility. He did not wish to divorce her because they had a
> child—a lad named Mírzá Nasruʾlláh—whom he cherished fondly. No words
> of admonishment bore any fruits or had any eﬀect on her. Eventually, the
> evildoers171 provoked this woman into going before Shaykh Husayn Zálim
> and informing him, “My husband is a Bábí, and each day congregates with
> other Bábís and has regular meetings. [For this reason,] I no longer wish
to live in his home.”

Shaykh Husayn knew [her husband] Áqá Mírzá Áqá, as he had acted with
> wisdom, pretending to be among the foremost devotees of the Shaykh even
> to the point that at the mosque Áqá Mírzá Áqá would spread the prayer-
> mat for the Shaykh and wait upon him. Because of his conﬁdence in him,
> at ﬁrst the Shaykh refused to believe the woman and spoke most sternly,
> “You are a liar, as Áqá Mírzá Áqá is among my conﬁdants.” In this manner,
he sent the woman away.

Certain righteous men, who had witnessed this discussion with the
> Shaykh, reported the matter to that gentle soul, saying, “Be vigilant, as
> your wife has gone before the Shaykh registering such complaints against
> you. For now, the latter has admonished her and dismissed her protest.
> However, if you have certain Writings in your home, it is best to remove
them immediately as he might follow through with an investigation.”

Áqá Mírzá Áqá had a pleasant Naskh style of calligraphy and often made
> copies of the Kitáb-i Íqán.172 He, however, paid no attention to their warn-
> ings, and the believers noting him to be heedless of their alerts, reported

Nabíl Aʿzam, The Dawn-Breakers, p. 156, states that he became a believer in the
> Báb on the occasion of His proclamation in the Masjid Vakíl. Later he traveled to Bagh-
> dad and attained the presence of Baháʾuʾlláh, and in answer to his questions, a Tablet
> in exposition of the Disconnected Letters of the Qurʾán, and the meaning of the Light
Verse was revealed.

Presumably, a reference to the Mushíruʾl-Mulk.

> come visit and then exhorted him to remove the Writings from his home
> and to deal with his wife in a way not to provoke her, as she might cause
mischief.

Nevertheless, after a few days, the wife had yet again gone before the
> Shaykh and cried out for intervention. This time the Shaykh, however, had
> remained silent. The mischief-makers, who had been at the Shaykh’s lecture,
> had spoken supportive of that shameless woman, and she, encouraged by
> ﬁnding a number championing her, had exclaimed, “O honored Shaykh!
> How can you allow my husband to be home at this hour busy with tran-
> scribing the Bábí books?” The Shaykh had become perplexed and stated,
> “If it is as you describe and you speak the truth, then with my own hands
I shall slay Mírzá Áqá!”

In their midst was a person who was secretly a believer. He had quickly
> left the gathering and reported the situation to me, thus, “A group of [p.195]
> troublemakers will shortly attack the home of Áqá Mírzá Áqá and will seize
> him and the Writings [in his possession] and will take them to the presence
> of the Shaykh.” I said to Nanih Maʿsumih, who [in former days] had been
> one of the Nayrízi captives and had remained behind in Shíráz working in
> our home, “Quickly proceed to Áqá Mírzá Áqá’s residence and inform him
> of the details, and bring with you any Writings he may have. It is very likely
> that the mob will attack his house and will conﬁscate the Writings for the
Shaykh. Make great haste to Áqá Mírzá Áqá!”

Nanih Maʿsumih had put on her chador and briskly made her way to
> the home of Áqá Mírzá Áqá and observed him to be serenely engaged in
> transcribing [Baháʾí Writings]. She apprised him of situation. However, in
> refusing her request, the latter stated, “These are just idle talks. Shaykh
> Husayn has the utmost conﬁdence in me.” [Nanih Maʿsumih] insisted, “It
> is far worse than you think! Rise and gather the Writings!” The honored Áqá
> Mírzá Áqá, however, procrastinated. Considering the urgency of the situation
> and Áqá Mírzá Áqá’s reluctance to heed her counsel, Nanih Maʿsumih had
> seized the box of the Writings placed before her host, and hiding it under
her chador, quickly walked out.

Stepping into the street, she heard the clamor of the mob approaching
> in haste and great fury, led by a number of the Akhúnds and the wife of
> that wronged-one. Hiding herself for the crowd to pass, the brave Nanih
Maʿsumih brought the box to me and informed me of the details.

Meanwhile, the crowd of myrmidons rushed into the house only to ﬁnd
> Áqá Mírzá Áqá sitting alone, enjoying a water-pipe. The wife entered the
> dwelling to seize the box of the Writings for the Akhúnds to take to the
> Shaykh, but was unable to ﬁnd it. Despite their thorough search, she and
> the Akhúnds found no evidence of any forbidden materials. Áqá Mírzá Áqá

> Shaykh accusing you of being a Bábí, and indeed a transcriber of their
> Writings.” Since he was conﬁdent that no Writings were left in his house,
> Áqá Mírzá Áqá replied, “As no trace of any illicit materials are found in my
home, it is most evident that my wife’s allegation is false!”

The Akhúnds admonished the woman, “Where are the materials you
> alleged to the honored Áqá [i.e., the Shaykh]? It is clear that you are a liar!”
> The woman had cried out, “By God, when I left the house this morning to
> attain the presence of Áqá, this apostate was engaged in transcribing. I do
> not lie.” The Akhúnds insisted, “If you speak the truth, then where are the
> Writings and the Books?” “Perhaps they have been taken by the ghosts,”
said the woman, “as Mírzá Áqá controls the ghouls too!”

[Notwithstanding their lack of ﬁndings,] Áqá Mírzá Áqá was taken by
> the mob to Shaykh Husayn Zálim who reproached him bluntly, but that
> wronged-one maintained his silence. The Shaykh insisted, “Mírzá Áqá, how
> do you respond to your wife’s claim that you are a Bábí?” “This woman is
> a liar,” Mírzá Áqá replied, “as she had alleged that I was a Bábí and a tran-
> scriber of their Writings, while in spite of their thorough search, none were
> found in my home. Had they found any, then it would have substantiated
> her statement. Therefore, it is evident that she harbors false resentments and
[p.200]         speaks disparagingly.” The Shaykh responded, “If she is a liar and you are

> not a Bábí, then you must curse them forthwith.” “I do not know them,
> and as such how can I curse people not known to me?” That tyrannical man
> [i.e., Shaykh Zálim] then named both His Holiness the Exalted One [the
> Báb] and the Blessed Perfection, and gave their particulars and instructed
> his victim to deprecate and denounce Both. On further refusing to comply
> with his persistently stated command, the Shaykh determined, “Indeed, it
is apparent that your wife has spoken the truth.”

Thereupon, he proceeded to administer punishments with his own hands
> on the accused and afterwards wrote a report to the governor, and imprisoned
that esteemed personage [Áqá Mírzá Áqá].

The following day, an enormous uproar engulfed the city, and again the
> Mushíruʾl-Mulk prepared a long list of names, giving it to the Hisámuʾs-
> Saltinih, claiming that they were all Bábís, deserving castigation and per-
secution.

The Prince summoned the Qavámuʾl-Mulk, handed him the list and stated,
> “You are to bring these men before me.” The Qavámuʾl-Mulk sensed that
> this time [the Navváb] was determined to see the matter through and that
> no intervention would help. Greatly perturbed, he instructed his farrashes
and the Dárúghih to apprehend the named men.

By that afternoon, the following were arrested and brought before the
> Qájár Prince: Áqá Mírzá Áqá Rikáb-Sáz; Mashhadí Nabí; Mashhadí Muham-
> mad-Jaʿfar Khayyát; Hájí Abúʾl-Hasan [Bazzáz]; Karbaláʾí Muhammad-
> Háshim; Mashhadí Abúʾl-Qásim Kharráz; Karbaláʾí Hasan Khán Sarvistání;
> Áqá Mírzá Báqir; Áqá Mullá ʿAbduʾlláh, the Fádil [Zarqání]; Áqá Mullá
> ʿAbduʾlláh Biká’; and a number of others. These men were assembled before
> [the Prince] Sultán-Murád Mírzá who instructed that they be chained and
> fettered in the dungeon.

[With the spread of this news] a great commotion was raised throughout
> the city. The thugs and ribald elements were now unrestrained to speak most
> vehemently [against the Baháʾí Faith] and perpetrate mischief. Anyone that
> harbored a grievance against another used the occasion to exact his wish.

No manner of antagonism was avoided.

The Release of Two Prisoners

> After a few days, the Qájár Prince ordered the wronged believers brought
> into his presence in his palace. At ﬁrst the honored Mullá ʿAbduʾlláh Fádil,
> [surnamed] Rafíʿ-Badíʿ, was brought forward. Both the Mushíruʾl-Mulk and
> the Qavámuʾl-Mulk were in attendance as well. The Mushír had a particular
> aﬃnity towards Fádil and did not wish to see him entangled in diﬃculties.
> The Prince addressed the prisoner, “O Akhúnd! They say that you are a
> Bábí!” “What am I to say?” the honored Fádil replied, “I pray that no one
> suﬀers such a day of troubles. Everyone has competitors in his own ﬁeld
> and domain. Even we rawdih-kháns have much rivalry among ourselves.
> Since my profession is rawdih-khání, many people in Fárs, particularly the
> aﬄuent citizens, are fond of my services, and this has precipitated jealousy
> among other preachers. Second, because in the past I had quoted verses of
> Mawláná [Jaláliʾd-Dín] Rúmí in my sermons in support of various themes,
> for some time they accused me of being one of the Illuminists. Moreover,
> since this servant associated with Hájí Áqá Muhammad and his esteemed
> son, Hájí ʿAli Áqá, and they have shown kindness to me, then people have
> further alleged, ‘The Akhúnd is a Sufí [mystic]!’ And now they charge that
> I am a Bábí! This servant does not understand any of these proclivities.
> Of a certainty, whoever has reported on this matter to your august self is
misinformed.”

Finding this an opportune moment, the Mushíruʾl-Mulk interjected, “The
> honored Fádil, Áqá Mullá ʿAbduʾlláh, is a deeply learned and well-lettered
> man. He is the foremost preacher of the city and is often the ﬁrst to oﬀer
> homilies in the homes of the nobles [of Shíráz]. In fact, unlike the other
> rawdih-kháns, he attends such gatherings only with a written invitation. The [p.205]
> city’s inhabitants universally testify to his trustworthiness, faith, sagacity,
> sincerity, piety, and detachment. In particular, he gives the closing sermons in
> religious ceremonies at the mosque and my Husayniyyih during the months
of Muharram and Safar, and the blessed month of Ramadán.”

On hearing the Mushíruʾl-Mulk intercede in such manner, the Prince
> paused a bit and then addressed the prisoner, “Fádil, is what they claim
> about you and others accurate, or is it a calumny?” Fádil replied with wis-
> dom, “Your exalted self should know that I am a seeker. However, I have
> not yet determined the veracity or falsehood of this Faith and do not know
> of things hidden.” With this answer, the Prince was convinced and stated,
> “God willing, what they say about you are lies, and I hereby release you on
> the condition that from the depth of your heart you pray for His Majesty
> the King.” As such, the honored Fádil regained his freedom.

After him, Mullá ʿAbduʾlláh Biká’ was summoned, and as he was a man
> of weak constitution, he had conducted himself in a manner pleasing to
> them. He too was released. Others remained imprisoned.

Hájí Muhammad Khán Balúch

> During this period, Muhammad Khán Balúch came to Shíráz. The enemies
> informed [the governor] that a dervish from Baluchistan sympathetic to
> these people [i.e., Baháʾís] had arrived and in the streets and bazaars spoke
> in their praise. [The Hisámuʾs-Saltanih] ordered his immediate arrest, and
> the oﬃcers located him in the Bazaar Kafsh-duzha [shoemakers], and after
> beating him harshly with their sticks, took him to the Governor’s Ark. The
> governor instructed him to be imprisoned and chained with the friends
arrested earlier. My father, Áqá Mírzá Áqá, used to relate:

> When I heard that Muhammad Khán had also been apprehended, I
> consulted with several of the friends and decided to take action through
> Hájí Mírzá ʿAbduʾlláh Khán Bályuz, [the ʿUnuʾd-Dawlih,] an uncle of the
> Muvaqqaruʾd-Dawlih. (Though not a believer, he was a virtuous man and
somewhat informed of the truth of this Cause.)

I went to see him, saying, “This man is from Baluchistan and a British
> subject, and on the accusation of being a Bábí173 Dervish has been impris-
> oned by the Hisámuʾs-Saltanih. As you discharge the oﬃce of the Bályuzi,
> it behooves you to exert eﬀorts towards his release. Perchance it is best to
> undertake this matter through Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí Khán, the Navváb, who is
> the British Consul General and can insist upon this man’s freedom.” Hájí
> Mírzá ʿAbduʾlláh Khán gave assurance that in whatever way possible he
would bring about his release.

He then went to visit Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí Khán, telling him, “It has come to
> my attention that one of the British subjects, who came to visit [Shíráz], has
> been arrested as a Bábí by the Prince Hisámuʾs-Saltanih. This is an insult on
> you as the representative of the British Empire. You must oﬃcially confront
the governor and free Muhammad Khán from his prison.”

The Navváb thought about it a bit and then expressed his readiness. He
> met ceremoniously with the Prince [Hisámuʾs-Saltanih] and said to him,
> “From what has been heard, you have arrested a British subject known
> as Muhammad Khán Balúch. In light of the alliance between our respec-
> tive nations, this iniquitous deed is untimely and unwarranted. I ask you
[p.210]               oﬃcially to either surrender him to me, or to stand responsible before my

> person is a Bábí! That is the reason for his arrest.” The Navváb replied,
> “It is not proven to me that he is a Bábí. And even if he is, he is not an
> Iranian citizen. At worse, he can be asked to quit this turbulent city and
> return to his own abode.” The governor persisted, “He is an Iranian.” And
> the Navváb responded harshly, restating his earlier position, and soon the
> matter had escalated between them. The Navváb held his ground and spoke
> most strenuously. (At that time, the Navváb in Shíráz was like the present
consul and enjoyed much prestige.)

The governor-general ordered [Hájí] Muhammad Khán brought forthwith
> and in presence of the Navváb asked him, “Where are you from?” Hájí
> Muhammad Khán responded in his native dialect, “I am a Baluch.” “From
> which region of the Baluchistan?” the governor then inquired. [In accordance
> with the secret instructions he had received, Muhammad Khán] responded,
> “From the British Baluchistan.” The governor further stated, “Dervish, they
> say you are a Bábí!” “To begin with, a Dervish has no religion, whether Bábí
> or otherwise. I do not understand your meaning.” The Hisámuʾs-Saltanih
> replied, “If you are not a Bábí, then you must curse Subh Azal.”174 Muham-
> mad Khán stated, “I curse subh azal, zuhr azal, and shám azal. All three be
cursed! I do not know subh azal or shám abad!”175

This manner of speech caused everyone to laugh extensively. Muhammad

It is noteworthy that by this date, 1871, the governor-general of Fárs still thought that
> Yahyá Azal was the head of the Bábí community, indicating that the news of Baháʾuʾlláh’s
> Declaration had not been widely promulgated even among the high-ranking oﬃcials. The
> title “Subh Azal”, literary, the Morn of Eternity, appears in an Islamic Tradition that is called
> Hadith Kumayl (or referred to as, “Risálat al-Kumayliyya,” Kumayl being a disciple of Imám
> ʿAlí), and a portion of it is quoted in by the Báb in Daláʾil Sabʿih (Bábíyyih Publication,
> p. 58). Mírzá Yahyá and his followers erroneously have taken this term as a reference to
> Mírzá Yahyá. It should be noted that the Báb only called him “Thamaratuʾl-Azalíyya” and
> “ ʿIsmuʾl-Azal” (see Mírzá Yahyá, Mustayqiz, pp. 391f.). However, the Báb did employ the
> title Suhb Azal in reference to various other leading Bábís and in the Kitáb Panj Shaʾn, He
employes this term to signify the recipient of divine inspiration.

Muhammad Khán, being a Baháʾí, did not hesitate to curse Subh Azal who had caused

The Release of Hájí Abúʾl-Hasan

> The wife of Hájí Abúʾl-Hasan177 was a religious and pious woman and
> in every manner was a support to her husband. She was also related to
> Shaykh Abú-Turáb, the Imám-Jumʿih, and as such, [my father] the Afnán
> consented that her kinsmen petition the Imám-Jumʿih178 for his interven-
> tion. Afterwards, the ladies of the household approached the Shaykh with
> this request, and he agreed to seek the husband’s freedom on the condition
that he would quit Shíráz for a while. The ladies accepted.

Subsequently, the Shaykh met with the Hisámuʾs-Saltanih and eventually
> persuaded the latter to release the Hájí with no further interrogations or
> troubles. On being released, the honored Hájí took his two esteemed sons
> and without a steed departed from the city in the direction of Sarvistan
and Maharlu. He related to me:

> Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí Khán was older and stronger, while Mírzá Muham-
> mad-Báqir Khán was younger and more delicate. I placed the latter on
> my shoulders and let his brother walk alongside me. During the day, we
> would hide in the mountainsides and in the caves, and at nighttime walked
> the wilderness. Every time I heard the footsteps of a wild animal or a
[p.215]         person, my whole being would tremble with fear, as if I had met the angel
of death.

It took me a while to reach Kharamih179 where, with the utmost diﬃculty
> and anguish, we stayed for a few months. When the winter season arrived,
> I realized that tarrying in such a village with two small children and no
> provisions was not possible. I consulted the Good Book about staying, it

The unpublished narrative of Qábil Ábádíʾí, p. 13, conﬁrms the same outline and
> states that after Shíráz, Muhammad Khán proceeded to Isfahán and there met the King of
> the Martyrs, and through him, sent a supplication to Baháʾuʾlláh requesting permission to
> visit the Holy Land and to remain there. His wish was granted, and, thereupon, he returned
> to Baluchistan, settled his aﬀairs, secured the ﬁnancial well-being of his wife and kins-
men, and then proceeded to the Holy Land and spent the rest of his life in that region.

Khán and Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán [Dihqán].

Parenthetically, Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh notes: Mention of the late Shaykh Abú-Turáb,
> the Imám-Jumʿih, was made in the earlier pages while describing the fatwá of the ʿulamá
> for the martyrdom of His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb] and his refusal to sign this
fatwá. He was a most virtuous and upright man.

> came out negative; consulted about returning to Shíráz, it was aﬃrmative.
Placing my reliance in God, I therefore returned to the city.

In Shíráz, all the tumults of the past had subsided, and only the same few
> wronged souls [i.e., Baháʾís] were still in prison. For two or three months, I
> stayed home180 in isolation, but then I realized that I could not just remain
> in hiding. Little by little, I came out and gradually began to frequent the
> streets or shops inconspicuously so that people would once more become
> accustomed to seeing me. I would often go to the home of Imám-Jumʿih
> Shaykh Abú-Turáb, and he would publicly speak of my faith, uprightness,
and the excellence of my character.

Finally, I decided to open a haberdasher shop at the Bazaar Hájí—one
> of the bazaars of Shíráz. However, every storeowner I approached to lease a
> place refused me, and it was only Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán who, without rent,
> gave me a small store that he owned at the entrance of the Bazaar.181 Now
> that I had a shop, I did not have the capital for merchandise. Once more,
> I went to the honored Afnán and apprised him of my situation. Without a
> word, thought, or hesitation, he went inside the house and came out with one
hundred tumáns cash as a loan. I raised my voice in gratitude to God.

Starting the following day, placing all my reliance in the Almighty
> Lord, I opened my shop and began selling some triﬂing items. The divine
> conﬁrmations poured forth, and soon I was successful. However, the other
> shopkeepers continued to cause many disturbances.

Fate of the Other Prisoners

> Karbaláʾí Hasan Khán Sarvistání was previously the Kalántar of Sarvistan,
> one of districts under the jurisdiction of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk. Through
> the intercession of the latter, he was eventually freed and sent home to
Sarvistan.

Mírzá Báqir was imprisoned for four months. Afterwards, he was
> brought out, extensively and severely beaten with sticks, and then released.
> He departed for Kirmán and there, because of his devotion and zeal [in
> the Cause of God], through the machinations of Hájí Muhammad-Karím
> Khán, the Athym,182 he was arrested and eventually martyred. No doubt,
> the details will be written in the history of the Cause in Kirmán.183

At the time, he was residing in the House of the Báb.

To the present day, this shop remains part of the estate of the descendants of Núriʾd-
Dín (Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán, private communications, August 1995).

conﬁrms that the Qurʾán prophesied him through this title.

The remaining three believers, namely, Mírzá Áqá Rikáb-Sáz, Mashhadí
> Nabí,184 and Mashhadí Muhammad-Jaʿfar [Khayyát], however, continued
> to languish in conﬁnement. Noting that through various means the other
> prisoners had been released greatly fueled the enmity and hatred of Shaykh
> Husayn Zálim. Therefore, he went before the Hisámuʾs-Saltanih, raucously
> raising the cry, “Our religion and faith is lost!” and spoke vehemently [in
> demand of severe disposition of the three imprisoned believers]. The Prince
> was induced to concur with his view and summoned the three men before
> him. No matter how they tried to force the three to recant their faith,
> they remained steadfast in their convictions, nay, would grow stronger in
> their constancy. The Qájár Prince was most bewildered. Immediately at
> that session, Shaykh Zálim wrote and issued a fatwá for their martyrdom,
> handing it to the Qájár oﬀspring. That very night, the three believers were
strangled with ropes in their prison cells.

The following morning, their wives and families were informed of their
> martyrdom and allowed to come and claim the bodies. After the ritual
> ablutions, the three martyrs were buried in Daruʾl-Salam, which is one
the famous cemeteries of Shíráz.185

Subsequent to these martyrdoms, the rabble continued to perpetrate
[p.220] untold atrocities. They would compose unseemly verses, and in the streets

> and the bazaar chant such songs. On the fortieth day of the martyrdom of
> those devotees of the Beloved’s Visage, all the rogue and lewd characters
> gathered, perpetrating every manner of insolence, brutality, and viciousness.
> Raising bags ﬁlled with diverse ﬁlth, refuse, sheep-skins, and dogs over
> their heads, they marched for four or ﬁve hours through the city, streets,
> and bazaars while singing and chanting slogans, and thence proceeding to
> the cemetery where they threw their heinous load on the graves of those
> fallen victims and committed yet other wicked and reprehensible acts.
> Truly, pen and tongue are ashamed of mentioning their deeds. Now that
> some ﬁfty years186 have passed since those days, on meeting one of the
> believers, the Shírází children still chant those contemptible verses.

Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúruʾl-Haqq, vol. 6, pp. 860–61, states that two years earlier,
> in AH 1286 [1869], he had walked to ʿAkká in the hope of attaining the presence of
> Baháʾuʾlláh. In the company of a group of pilgrims, he reached his destination, but instruc-
> tions were received from Baháʾuʾlláh that, on account of certain diﬃculties, the visitors
should not come within the citadel. Mashhadí Nabí immediately returned to Iran.

A detailed description of this episode is given in Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúruʾl-Haqq,
vol. 6, pp. 858–61; see also Shoghi Eﬀendi, God Passes By, p. 200.

One of the internal evidences that suggest this narrative was composed in early
1920s.

It was shortly after these events that the Hisámuʾs-Saltinih was dismissed
> from oﬃce and departed from Fárs. With his departure from the scene,
much of the persecution against the Faith abated.

Subsequent to these occurrences, the wife [of Rikáb-Sáz] was overcome
> with regret and remorse, but of what use! Those wronged-ones had already
> won their glorious station, leaving behind this troubled plane for the
> exalted paradise, the Abhá Kingdom and the everlasting bliss, hearkening
> to the Tongue of Grandeur, “Blessed are they and happy is their end.”
> Because of their deeds, history will forever recall their bravery and signal
achievement.

The wife [of Rikáb-Sáz] arranged for a large gravestone with his illustri-
> ous name and dates engraved upon it, and this was placed over his resting
> spot. However, the vagabonds learned of this and demolished the stone
> and the gravesite. Until her very last hour, she was ﬁlled with regret over
> her deeds and would lament bitterly. The One Compassionate God is the
> forgiver of the sins.187

A moving summary of the martyrdom of these three believers is given in Mázan-
> darání, Táríkh Zuhúruʾl-Haqq, vol. 5, pp. 134–36, where its occurrence is dated AH

CHAPTER NINE

THE PASSING OF KHADÍJIH BAGUM

[p.222:9] During this period, various teachers of God’s Cause and diﬀusers of the

> Divine Word arrived in Fárs in service to the Faith, thereby renewing the
> spiritual life of many souls. Amid such teachers coming to Shíráz was Áqá
> Mullá Muhammad Qáʾiní, [surnamed] Nabíl Akbar, who ranked among
> the foremost promoters of the Cause. His stay in Fárs lasted some thir-
> teen months and produced many beneﬁts for the province and nearby
> territories, resulting in the ediﬁcation of a number of individuals.

Munírih Khánum’s Sojourn in Shíráz

> During Shavvál of AH 1288 [December 1871], Munírih Khánum,
> who was traveling to the Holy Land for the purpose of her marriage to
> ʿAbduʾl-Bahá, arrived in Shíráz from Isfahán. [Prior to her arrival,] a letter
> addressed to Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán was sent from Isfahán by Áqá Mírzá
> Muhammad-Hasan, the Sultánuʾsh-Shuhadá188 [the King of Martyrs],
> indicating that in accordance with Baháʾuʾlláh’s instructions, Munírih
> Khánum, an accomplished daughter of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí Nahriy,
> together with her brother, Áqá Siyyid Yahyá, were to proceed to the Holy
> Land and en route would arrive [in Shíráz] and that a residence was to
be designated for their stay.

After considering the contents of this letter from Isfahán, the Afnán
> consulted with Khadíjih Bagum and because of its proximity to her own
> residence, she proposed the house of the Khál [Akbar], Hájí Mírzá Siyyid
> Muhammad, as the residence for the coming guests. At that time, Khadíjih
> Bagum lived in the house of Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, the Khál [Aʿzam],
> with her maternal sister [Hájíyyih Bíbí Ján-Ján], who was the widow of
> the martyred-uncle, and the homes of the two uncles were adjacent to
> one another, connected by a common wall. Therefore, this house was
> designated for Munírih Khánum’s stay.

Balyúzí, Eminent Baháʾís in the Time of Baháʾuʾlláh, p. 231, attributes the letter to
the Mahbúbuʾsh-Shuhadá [the Beloved of Martyrs].

the passing of khadíjih bagum               93

Munírih Khánum and her brother, Áqá Siyyid Yahyá, arrived in the [p.225]
> month of Dhiʾl-Qaʿdih [January 1872]. During their sojourn, she was a
> constant companion and consort of Khadíjih Bagum, and wherever they
> visited were in each other’s company. For a few nights, she also tarried
> at the residence of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán. After a stay of 15 days in
> Shíráz, Munírih Khánum departed for Búshihr and eventually the Holy
Land.189

While she was in Shíráz, one day during the course of their conver-
> sations, Khadíjih Bagum stated, “Having been in the hands of diverse
> individuals, the Blessed House of the Báb has suﬀered extensively and
> stands in ruin. I wish for it to be renovated so that I could take my resi-
> dence there. When you have attained the sacred presence [of Baháʾuʾlláh],
> kindly implore Him that the request of this forsaken one be graced with
> the favor of acceptance so that I would be able to take my residence
> there for the protection of the House.” [Munírih Khánum] had written
> down her supplication and presented it to Baháʾuʾlláh, Who graciously
> commanded Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán to renovate the House in whatever
> manner Khadíjih Bagum desired and for her residence to be transferred
> there afterwards.

Renovation of the House of the Báb

> Subsequent to issuance of His blessed instruction, the Afnán commenced
> the repair work. He designated one of the believers Ustád ʿAbduʾr-Razzáq
> [a mason of Shíráz] as the construction supervisor and the laborers’ over-
> seer, himself visiting the site two or three times daily. In the course of
> this renovation, major architectural modiﬁcations were introduced, and
> the design and conﬁguration of the entire House were changed from the
original layout.

This work was completed after several months. While the reconstruc-
> tion was taking place, a small house adjacent on the eastern ﬂank that
> belonged to a Jewish man who had recently converted to Islam was pur-
> chased at the owner’s insistence, renovated, and made part of the Blessed
> House of the Báb.

See Balyúzí, Baháʾuʾlláh the King of Glory, pp. 344–47.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 93                                                                   7/10/2008 3:45:18 PM

After completion of the renovation, Khadíjih Bagum took up residence
> in the Blessed House in AH 1290 [1873]. Once more the friends began
to come on pilgrimage to that sacred spot and to visit that exalted leaf.

Certain sinister men reported this development to Farhád Mírzá, the
> Muʿtamiduʾd-Dawlih. That is, one day, several of the mischief-makers called
> on the Muʿtamiduʾd-Dawlih and informed him about the Blessed House.
> The gist of their comments was, “The House of the Siyyid-i Báb is now
> renovated and occupied by some of His kinsmen, and visitors from here
> and there frequent the House.” Mírzá Abúʾl-Hasan Khán Munshí-Báshí
> and Mírzá Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín Khán ʿAlí-Ábádí, who ranked among the most
> pious of men and devoted Baháʾís, were in attendance in that meeting
and heard the matter [reported to the governor].

Four hours into the night, these two believers came to the residence
> of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán and informed him of what had transpired in
> the meeting with the Prince, adding their recommendation, “It would be
> best if for some time the Holy Mother190 [i.e., Khadíjih Bagum] did not
reside in the House, allowing such talk to subside.”

The following morning, the Afnán gained the presence of Khadíjih
> Bagum and informed her of the details, as conveyed by the Munshí-Báshí
> and Áqá Mírzá Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín Khán, suggesting that it would be bet-
> ter if for several months she did not live there. At ﬁrst, she had sobbed
> bitterly; but eventually she consented to move her residence, not to the
> house that she previously lived in, but to the home of her nephew, Áqá
> Mírzá Áqá Afnán. That very day, together with her maidservant, Fiddih,
> she transferred her residence to the home of my late father and lived there
for ﬁve and a half months.

When various machinations were alleviated, Khadíjih Bagum returned
[p.230] to the House of the Báb, but lived there with the utmost wisdom. She

> never used the main entrance of the House, and all the comings and
> goings were through the entrance of the newly acquired house.191

The original is “Bí bí,” a term of endearment for the older ladies of the house.

It seems that Khadíjih Bagum’s residence in the House of the Báb continued to agitate
> the neighborhood. In a Tablet dated 19 Safar AH 1295 [22 February 1878] Baháʾuʾlláh
instructs Núriʾd-Dín in Shíráz (NC 16):

> If at this time residence in the True House by the blessed wife, upon her rest all
> My Glory and My Exaltation, provokes commotion among Our servants and causes
> uproar and tyranny, then dwelling in that location is not permitted. . . .Under all
> conditions, wisdom must be observed. If in these days, habitation in the House by
> the wife [Khadíjih Bagum] or the Afnán is against wisdom and prudence, then its
> doors must be closed and none be allowed to dwell therein.

Dahají in Shíráz

> During this period, Hájí Siyyid ʿAlí-Akbar Dahají arrived in Shíráz and
> commenced teaching and proclaiming the Cause. In accordance with
> the instructions of the Blessed Perfection, he was also engaged in tran-
> scribing a protection prayer revealed by the Exalted Pen of the Primal
> Point. Copies were made for each of the friends for a contribution of an

> are currently available.

Departure of the Afnán from Shíráz

> The news of the martyrdom of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn, the
> Mahbúbuʾsh-Shuhadá, and Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Hasan, the Sultánuʾsh-
> Shuhadá, in Isfahán in AH 1296 [1879], soon reached Shíráz. At that
> time, Farhád Mírzá, the Muʿtamiduʾd-Dawlih, was the governor-general,
> and this Qájár Prince was extremely antagonistic [towards the Cause].
> There was great commotion in Shíráz, and merchants and shopkeepers
> in the customs, the commercial oﬃces, and the bazaar spoke ceaselessly
> of the events of Isfahán. The elders [of the community] were particularly
> apprehensive, since it was only recently that the episode of the Three
Martyrs had occurred in Shíráz.

The elders were enveloped in fear. Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí, Hájí
> Mírzá Buzurg, Áqá Siyyid Muhammad-Husayn, Áqá Mírzá Abúʾl-Hasan,
> Áqá Shaykh ʿAlí Mírzá, and a number of other friends gathered and
> consulted on the situation. They concluded that Áqá Mírzá Áqá [Núriʾd-
> Dín] was most renowned [as a Baháʾí], and should atrocities be plotted
> against the community, they would of a certainty be directed at him.
> They said, “None of us are known [as Baháʾís] among the people. From
> the very beginning, because of his devotion, zeal, and associations, Áqá
> Mírzá Áqá is known [as a Baháʾí,] and should troubles now be directed
> against him, others would suﬀer as well.” Each of them spoke in similar
> manner, until they unanimously resolved that it was best for Áqá Mírzá
> Áqá Afnán not to remain in Shíráz and through Búshihr to depart forth-
> with for Bombay.

Afterwards, in its entirety, this consultative body came to the residence
> of the Afnán and informed him of their decision that in light of the
> turmoil, upheavals, and chaos in Shíráz and all the talk current among
> the people, it was more prudent for him to arrange his aﬀairs and depart
> immediately for Búshihr.193 Though Áqá Mírzá Áqá had oﬀered many
> arguments, the elders did not accept them so that, on account of their
> insistence and within twenty-four hours, he left for Búshihr with his
personal attendant, and then for Bombay [India].194

With his departure, inactivity and dormancy fell for a while upon the
> province of Fárs. [Baháʾí] meetings were infrequent, and the friends would
> rarely gather. Even such devoted believers as Áqá Mullá ʿAbduʾlláh Fádil,
> [surnamed] Rafíʿ-Badíʿ, Áqá Mírzá ʿAbduʾl-Karím, and some others would
> comment, “With the departure of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán, the light of Fárs
> has become eclipsed. We did not appreciate all his merits. The worth of
each thing becomes apparent in its absence.”

For a while it went thus, until once again the Exalted and Glorious
> God sent forth such devoted personages as Hájí Mírzá Ghulám-Husayn,
> Áqá Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, and Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán. Through
> these sacred and enkindled ﬁgures, and their zeal and energy, life was
> renewed in Fárs, and all were rejuvenated. It was during this time that
> the divinely learned and spiritually awakened Hájí Mírzá Haydar-ʿAlí
[p.235] arrived in Shíráz, and the friends commenced holding many gathering

> to beneﬁt from his wondrous presence, and a new fervor and spirit was
> breathed into all.

The Final Years of Khadíjih Bagum, Her Illness and Passing

> After the departure of the Báb from Shíráz and the subsequent news
> of the martyrdom of His Holiness, His mother together with her own
> mother, in the company of her brother, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad,
> left for the ʿAtabát where she remained the rest of her days. During this

Private correspondence between the two martyred brothers in Isfahán, namely, the
> King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs, indicates that they were business partners
> with Núriʾd-Dín. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that part of the concern for the
> latter stemmed from the fear that the enemies of the fallen brothers in Isfahán would try
to extend their hostilities to all their business partners, including Núriʾd-Dín.

About a year later, in a Tablet dated 14 Rabíʿuʾth-Thání AH 1297 [26 March 1880],
> Baháʾuʾlláh instructed Núriʾd-Dín to commence business and commerce: “In accordance
> with the divine decree, that illustrious personage must become engaged in trade, and assur-
> edly means for such an occupation will be made ready” (Núriʾd-Dín Collection, p. 22).

> time, Khadíjih Bagum was alone in Shíráz, consumed by her inner agita-
> tion over the fate of her exalted Husband. Day and night she burnt like
> a candle, her sorrow and despondency knowing no end and her anguish

depressed, and ill.

The Blessed Beauty’s residence at the Abode of Peace [Baghdad] and
> the arrival of His many Tablets, however, instilled an everlasting spirit

> Countenance were thoroughly shattered. Her sole consolation was now
the Tablets that bore the loving expressions of her kind Lord.195

In the year AH 1298 [1881], Siyyid ʿAlí196 came from Yazd to Shíráz
> and attained the presence of Khadíjih Bagum. He stayed for several
> months and often, day and night, would come visit Khadíjih Bagum. In
> the course of his conversations, he expressed his desire to visit the Holy
> Land and implored her to intercede on his behalf so that one of the
> exalted leaves [of Baháʾuʾlláh] would join him in matrimony. In response,
> Khadíjih Bagum stated, “I will make this request, and of a certainty my
> supplication will ﬁnd acceptance in His sacred presence. However, you
> must promise that when the appointed time has arrived, you will come
> from Yazd to Shíráz and take me with you to the Holy Land.” Siyyid
> ʿAlí placed both hands on his eyes, stating, “As a humble servant, I am
> at your service.” Assured of his solemn promise, she penned a supplica-
> tion requesting and imploring marriage [between Siyyid ʿAlí and one of
> Baháʾuʾlláh’s daughters] and sent the envelope to Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán
> in Bombay. In turn, my father forwarded her missive along with his own
> supplication to the Holy Land.197

Several of Baháʾuʾlláh’s Tablets to Khadíjih Bagum are included in INBMC
51:252–62, nos. 258–66.

In the original manuscript, often Siyyid ʿAlí’s name follows a blank space, suggesting
a descriptive phrase associated with his mention has been erased by later hands.

In his Memories, Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh notes that in this request; ʿAbduʾl-Bahá was also
instrumental in petitioning Baháʾuʾlláh to consent to this marriage.

Meanwhile, Siyyid ʿAlí returned to Yazd awaiting the news from the
> Holy Land. When the missive [from Khadíjih Bagum] was presented
> into the sanctiﬁed presence of Baháʾuʾlláh, her request was favored with
> approval. When this glad tiding from the Holy Land was received, Khadíjih
Bagum conveyed it to Yazd, adding:

> Praise be to God that the request of this desolate one was graced with
> approval. Now I have nothing further to do in Shíráz and have made the nec-
> essary preparations for the journey awaiting your arrival. Of a certainty, you
> must leave at once and come to Shíráz so that we can journey together.

> Day and night, she was beaming with joy and exhilaration. When the
> friends would attain her presence, the sole subject of her discourse was
[p.240] her forthcoming journey. She had seen to all the necessary arrangements

> expecting the arrival of a letter from Yazd and the news of the family
> members coming to Shíráz. Indeed she was counting every ﬂeeting hour.
> With the delivery of every post, she would quickly dispatch her servant
to check to see if a communication had been received from Yazd.

Meanwhile, Siyyid ʿAlí, his parents, brothers, and sister departed from
> Yazd and through ʿIshqábád and Istanbul proceeded [to the Holy Land].
He wrote her:

> Since we were traveling as a group, wisdom dictated that we do not journey
> through Shíráz. Therefore, we voyaged by way of ʿIshqábád. After attaining
> His sacred presence and fulﬁlling my objective, I will return to Shíráz and
> accompany you to the Holy Land.

> On seeing this letter from Yazd and beholding its message—which was
> indeed the angel of death, slaying the spirit of that devotee of the Beloved—
> Khadíjih Bagum cried out loud and sobbed and moaned bitterly, speaking
> expressions of disappointment and distress. For some two hours she cried
> and lamented unceasingly.198 That very day, she contracted a fever, which
> made her bedridden for ﬁve and a half months and eventually led to her
> passing on 2 Dhiʾl-Hajjih AH 1299 [15 October 1882],199 when that
> leaf of paradise ascended from this world of dust, and her triumphant
> spirit soared to the Supreme Concourse and Abhá Paradise, relieved of
> its separation and rejoicing in everlasting union.

See appendix 6 for Baháʾuʾlláh’s Tablet regarding the ﬁnal letter of Khadíjih Bagum
to Him.

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh added marginally, “I have the letter of the late Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-
Qásim providing this date.”

Burial of Khadíjih Bagum

> It was ﬁve hours into the night that her remains were conducted out of
> the Blessed House and after ritual washing and shrouding, her earthly
remains were interred. . . .200

In honor of that ever-present spirit, the Blessed Perfection revealed
> a Visitation Tablet that tells of her condition.201 Only one verse of that
> Tablet of Visitation will be cited at this point to illustrate the depth of
> her yearning and despondency: “We testify that in thee two signs were
> conjoined and evident: the verse of reunion gave thee life, whereas the
verse of separation caused thee to expire.”

The period of residence of Khadíjih Bagum in the Blessed House was
nine years prior to her ascension.

The text of her Visitation Tablet will be quoted in its entirety for the
> reader to gain insight into the exalted station of faith and certitude that
she attained:

> In the Name of our Lord, the Ancient, the Comforter, the Consoler, the
Exalted, the Most High.

Truly My Pen groans, and My Tablet weeps inasmuch as the lamenta-
> tions of the faithful ones have ascended, and the tears of the denizens of
> the Supreme Paradise pour down. Methinks happiness hath closed its gates,
> the very limbs of joy have trembled, the heavens are shut out from their

Washing of the dead and shrouding took place at Hammam Khayrí, otherwise known
as Guldastih (Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán, private communications, August 1995).

On 10 November 1882, Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim, the brother-in-law of the Báb,
> wrote to Áqá Mírzá Áqá Núriʾd-Dín about the passing of his sister, Khadíjih Bagum. In
> this letter, he asked Núriʾd-Dín to inform Baháʾuʾlláh of the passing of Khadíjih Bagum as
> result of her profound disappointment in not being able to visit Him. Núriʾd-Dín wrote
> as bidden, and in response to his missive he received a Tablet from Baháʾuʾlláh, which
> contained a Tablet of Visitation revealed in honor of Khadíjih Bagum. A facsimile of this
> Text in the hand of Mírzá Áqá Ján appears after page 186 in Fayzí, Khándán Afnán and
> can also be found in the Núriʾd-Dín Collection, pp. 74–82, dated 14 Safar AH 1300 [25
> December 1882]. A slight variation of the same Tablet appears in Baháʾuʾlláh, Áthár Qalam
> Aʿlá (Traces of the Supreme Pen), vol. 4, pp. 201–4, 125 BE, and in the same volume, 133
> BE publication, pp. 339–41. Moreover, a version is included in Ishráq-Khávarí’s Ayyám
> Tisʿih, pp. 29–31. However, the latter source does not include the paragraph beginning
> with “O fruit of My Tree!” but instead has concluded the Text with the following verse:
> “Bless Thou, O Lord my God, the Divine Lote-Tree and its leaves, and its boughs, and
> its branches, and its stems, and its oﬀshoots, as long as Thy most excellent titles will
> endure and thy most august attributes will last. Protect it, then, from the mischief of the
> aggressor and the host of tyranny. Thou art, in truth, the Almighty, the Most powerful.”
> This verse, of course, appears in the closing paragraph of the Tablet of Visitation for the
> Twin Manifestations as assembled by Nabíl Aʿzam. Nabíl’s source for this last section is
> not currently known, nor does this section appear in the facsimile copy.

behold, I heard a voice calling out:

O servant in attendance! What is it that hath made you so sorrowful and
> taken from your hands the reins of choice? Hath the world been darkened
> before all its peoples? Have the trees become uprooted? Have the foundations
> trembled, and doth the ediﬁce itself shake? Have the mountains crumbled

> abandoned all creation? Did the Pen stay its motion? Hath utterance itself
> been muted and lost its ornaments? Did the outpouring stop? Did the Builder
> come to regret having ﬁrst built? Hath the Divine Spread been rolled up?

Wherefore do I behold you immersed in an ocean of sorrow?
[p.245]             Now thy sad lamentations rise, and again thy tears descend. Where is the

> canopy of glory? Where the Tabernacle of happiness? Where the Tent of joy,
> the shelter of cheerfulness? Where is thy smiling face? Where the ornament
> of thy name, the servant? Where are thy determination and thy strength in
> transcribing that which the All-Merciful hath revealed for all existence? It
> is as if I beheld before me thy face become sallow, thy frame wasting, thy
> strength melting. I beseech the One Who aided thee and Who made thee
> cognizant and adorned thee with the ornament of acceptance and made
> thee stand before His countenance, and Who made thee hearken unto His
> melodies and His utterances, and caused to appear from thee that through
which the breezes of life were wafted, that thou disclose the matter.

I made reply: Doest thou not know what hath come to pass by virtue
> of the decree of our Lord, the King of Kings? I was bedecked in happiness
> as I was hearkening unto the Speaker of Sinai. Methinks I was pacing the
> meadows of joy and soaring in the atmosphere of felicity, and thus did I

> in the Face of our Lord the Most Glorious. Then did the Countenance
> of the Creator of the heavens turn to me and declare, exalted be His
station:

Didst thou not hear, O servant of God that which the irrevocable decree
> hath ordained? The Most Sublime Fruit hath fallen from the Divine Lote-
> Tree. She was indeed the Remnant of the Beloved of the World in the
Kingdom of His creation.

I swear by God, My Aim and the Aim of all things, when I saw the sor-

> have passed into the realm of non-existence. Then the Countenance of God
turned unto me and said:

O servant of God! The calamities of the People of Bahá are renewed
> as set down by the Supreme Pen, inasmuch as the established decree has
> come to pass on the Greatest Holy Leaf. Verily, she is indeed that Fruit at
> the mention of whose name the fragrance of Her Beloved is wafted, He
> through Whose Name the heavens are uplifted and by Whom the heavens
> are adorned with the Sun, Its eﬀulgence, and Its rays. Verily, her name in
> its essence as well as outwardly calls to the remembrance of the people
> the Days of Her Beloved and the Beloved of all things. She is indeed the
> leaf that clung unto the Lote-Tree beyond which there is no passing. She
> attained the meeting with the Lord of mankind. She precedes the entire
> world in this except such as God hath willed, the Lord of the Throne above
and of earth below.

Upon hearing this, sorrow overwhelmed me. My heart melted, my skin
> crept in grief, my limbs trembled, and my lamentations and wailings rose
> high until I returned to my abode and dwelling. I found it to be the house
> of sorrows, and I became occupied in transcribing that which the All-Merci-
> ful God hath revealed. After a few minutes passed, I was once more present
> before His Countenance by virtue of His sovereign command over all things.
> Then the Point of adoration of all existence seen and unseen turned to me
and declared, exalted be His majesty, and sublime are His words:

Bring thou pen and ink that I may make mention of the remnant of the
> Primal Point, she who sacriﬁced herself with love and devotion so that my
> loved ones from lands and cities may visit her and recite in her memory
these words.
These are His words, exalted and sanctiﬁed be He!

He is the Consoler, the Sorrowful!
O Pen! In truth a most mighty calamity and a great tragedy hath
> befallen Thee, by reason of which the Supreme Concourse and the denizens
> of the All Highest Realm are wailing. On this account sorrows have become
so great that they have touched the hem of the All-Merciful.

Blessed is he who hath determined to visit her in her life and after her
> ascension, and great is the blessedness of that handmaiden who hath sought
her resting place and through her sought nearness unto God.

The glory that shines from My Luminous Countenance and the light that
> is manifest from the heaven of My Name, the All-Glorious, rest upon thee,
> O thou who art the fruit of the Sadratuʾl-Muntahá, and the Holy Luminous
> Leaf upon that Tree, and the consort of the One through Whose Appearance
> the Kingdom of eternity, and all created things, were wreathed in smiles. We
> testify that thou art the ﬁrst leaf to have attained the chalice of reunion in
> the Day of the Covenant and the last fruit to surrender her soul in separa-
> tion. Thou art the one whose heart melted, whose mind burnt, and whose
> limbs were dismembered by virtue of thy remoteness from that Station
> which God hath made the Dawning Place of His Verses, the Dayspring of
> His clear testimonies, the Manifestation of His Names, the Source of His
> Commandments, and the Seat of His Throne.

We testify that in thee two signs were conjoined and evident: the verse of

> thy calamity, a sea of grief was set in motion, and the breezes of forgive-

I bear witness that on the night thou didst ascend to the Abhá Horizon

Thou art that one on account of whose calamity the maidens of paradise

> she who, upon hearing the call from the Tongue of the Sovereign of the
> Kingdom of Names, didst accept Him, and this attraction enkindled thee
to such an extent that all control well nigh escaped thy hands.

O thou My leaf ! O thou who hast ﬂown in the atmosphere of My love!

> O thou who hast turned unto My Countenance, who hast spoken forth
> My praise! We have revealed for thee a remembrance whose traces will not
> be erased by the passing of the centuries and the rolling of the ages. We
> have immortalized thy memory through Our supreme Pen in the Crimson
> Tablet, whose content none knoweth except God, the Creator of all things.
> We have, moreover, made mention of thee in this Tablet in such wise that
> the near ones may remember thee and the believers in the divine unity may
turn toward thy resting place.

Blessed art thou. All happiness be thine, and all happiness be his, who
> comes before thy grave and recites that which the All-Bountiful hath revealed
> in this day of the Return.202

The Custodianship of the House of the Báb

> In accordance with the Blessed Perfection’s instructions, subsequent to the
> passing of Khadíjih Bagum, her sister took up residence in the Blessed
> House of the Báb. That is, Baháʾuʾlláh was asked about the protection
> and maintenance of the Blessed House, and in a Tablet addressed to Áqá
Mírzá Áqá Afnán it was revealed:

> The custodianship of the House hath been granted to the exalted leaf, the
mother of that illustrious personage [Núriʾd-Dín].

Thus spoke the Tongue of Grandeur at this moment: O My Afnán! My
> glory and My favor rest upon thee. The exalted noblewoman, mother of thy
> honored self, is worthy of residence in that House. Custodianship of the
> House hath therefore been granted and bestowed upon her, and after her,
> to her progeny, as they are the remembrance of God and of her throughout
> centuries and ages.203

> Consonant with Baháʾuʾlláh’s hallowed instruction, the illustrious sister [of
> Khadíjih Bagum], that is, the mother of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán, took up
> residence in the Blessed House and became the custodian and protector
> of that Sacred Ediﬁce. In the year AH 1302 [1884], instructions were
> issued from the heaven of Baháʾuʾlláh’s Grace and Mercy, and ﬁxed by
> His seal, for the custodianship of the Blessed House of the Báb to be
> entrusted to the sister [Zahrá Bagum] and her descendants. The original
> of this command, together with other Tablets revealed from the Pen of
> the Center of Covenant about the custodianship of the Blessed House,
> is now in the ﬁles of the custodians of that Threshold.204

been instructed previously. All are obliged to respect and honor that Sacred Ediﬁce.”

CHAPTER TEN

EVENTS OF 1880s

[p.254:4] During this period, the promoter of the Cause of God, Hájí Mírzá Haydar-

> ʿAlí Isfahání arrived in Shíráz.205 He stayed for a few months and traveled
> to various towns in Fárs, including Nayríz, Sarvistán, and Ábádih, and
> engaged in planting the seeds of faith. He succeeded in oﬀering great
> services and awakening a large number of individuals [to the Cause].

Imprisonment of Four Baháʾís from Sarvistán

> In the year AH 1300 [1882], during the governorship of Sultán Husayn
> Mírzá, the Jaláluʾd-Dawlih, and deputyship of Mírzá Fath-ʿAlí Khán, the
> Sáhib-Díván, a disturbance took place in Sarvistán between the friends
[p.255] and nonbelievers that escalated into a serious contention. As such, a

> report was sent to Shíráz, and the governor-general commissioned ʿAlí
> Khán to proceed to Sarvistán, thoroughly investigate the matter, and
report to him.

After the arrival of ʿAlí Khán, non-Baháʾís gathered around him and
> recounted many absurdities. Since ʿAlí Khán was a mischievous person,
> he connived with them and sent a report to Shíráz to their liking. This
> precipitated an instruction by the authorities that the suspected persons
> [i.e., Baháʾís] were to be [arrested and] sent to Shíráz. ʿAlí Khán chained
> the following [four Baháʾís] and sent them from Sarvistán to Shíráz:
> Karbaláʾí Hasan Khán; Karbaláʾí Sádiq; Mashhadí Sulaymán; and Ghu-
lám-ʿAlí Khán, grandson of Karbaláʾí Hasan Khán.

Upon their arrival, they were presented at the governor’s garden to the
Sáhib-Díván,206 who after interrogation commanded their beating. The

The second son of Hájí Mírzá ʿAlí-Akbar, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk I, and a son-in-law

> farrashes assembled the bastinado and applied it severely to Karbaláʾí
> Hasan Khán. After him, Karbaláʾí Sádiq was battered extensively, and he
> was followed by Mashhadí Sulaymán. When it was Ghulám-ʿAlí’s turn to
> sustain the blows of the bastinado, that brave soul spoke critically of the
> authorities, “We have done no wrong. Your purpose is to harm innocent
> people. ʿAlí Khán has falsely reported.” Each prisoner was stricken [by
> bastinado] for an hour. Afterwards, they were ordered chained and fettered
> in a dungeon along with thieves and highway bandits. For some time,
they remained thus constrained.

Being young, fearless, and ﬁlled with fervor and enthusiasm when he
> had converted, Ghulám-ʿAlí Khán, out of devotion, valor, and bravery,
> had tattooed on his right arm, “The Visage of Bahá stands manifest,” and
> on the left arm, “And its eﬀulgence revives me.” This was a sign by which
that courageous and peerless young man was known as a Baháʾí.

One day, the Sáhib-Díván summoned Ghulám-ʿAlí Khán, and in chains
> the prisoner was conducted before him. The minister ordered the prisoner’s
> shirtsleeves rolled up and then asked the captive, “What marks are these on
> your arms?” With utmost courage and in a thunderous voice, he replied,
> “This is the Name of my Beloved” and thereupon had proceeded to chant
> the verse. Bewildered, the Sáhib-Díván asked further, “Are you not afraid to
> so boldly express your conviction?” “If I was apprehensive of consequences,
> I would not have engraved these tattoos.” The Sáhib-Díván called in the
> executioner and ordered him to sever the prisoner’s ears. Afterwards, as a
> lesson to all, he was paraded in the bazaar and subsequently imprisoned
> again. For some time, he continued to remain in the Sáhib-Díván’s con-
> ﬁnement, along with his honored grandfather, Karbaláʾí Hasan Khán; his
mother’s uncle, Karbaláʾí Sádiq; and Mashhadí Sulaymán.

After ﬁve years, the Sáhib-Díván was dismissed from the governorship
> of Fárs and left Shíráz. Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk
> [III],207 implemented these believers’ release from conﬁnement and aided
> their return to Sarvistán.208

A son of ʿAlí-Muhammad Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk II, he was born in Shíráz in
> 1851 and in 1871 assumed the oﬃces of Kalántar and Biglar-Baykí of the province. Upon
> the passing of his father in 1884, he inherited his title and his vast estate. For biography

Renewed Troubles for the Believers of Sarvistán

> In AH 1305 [1887], the central government appointed the Prince Uvays
> Mírzá, the Ihtishámʾd-Dawlih,209 as the governor-general of Fárs. The Prince
was ceremoniously installed in oﬃce and assumed the governorship.

During these years, once more, mischief-makers caused disturbance in

Muhammad-Qásim Khán Baydáʾyí was among the aﬄuent and pros-

came to Shíráz.

One day, the Prince paid him a visit and was received with consider-

> prepare the pipe for the Prince and had it brought in for his enjoyment.
> The Prince [Ihtishámuʾd-Dawlih] had greatly praised his host’s water-pipe,
its manufacture, and its crown.

Upon the conclusion of the gathering and his departure, [Muhammad-]
> Qásim Khán had placed that water-pipe and some gold coins in a box and
> sent them after the Prince as a gift to him. This act of generosity greatly
> impressed the governor, and from then on he always sought an occasion to
> repay this kindness. It was not long after that the situation of the books,
Tablets, and Writings occurred, and that incident is as follows.

By reason of his devotion and aﬀection for the Cause, Muhammad-
> Qásim Khán always preferred to employ servants and maidservants who
> were his conﬁdants and had an aﬃnity [for the Baháʾí Faith]. There was
> a certain Hájí Murshid and his wife, who both claimed allegiance to the
> Cause. Because of this, Muhammad-Qásim Khán and his wife, who was
> a most devoted and enkindled believer as well, had the greatest conﬁ-
> dence and trust in this man and woman, to the point that the complete
> authority and control of their vault was entrusted to Hájí Murshid’s
> wife, who knew all the details of their precious possessions. The wife of
[Muhammad-Qásim] Khán was ailing, paralyzed, and bedridden.

One day, the wife of Hájí Murshid, intending to steal some of her
> mistress’ possessions, went into the vault, opened the box containing
> some of her clothing, and noticed that there were two smaller boxes
> within. She picked up both boxes and concealed them in the kitchen. At
> nighttime, when all the servants and the members of the household had
> retired for the evening and quiet had enveloped the house, she opened
> the two boxes. She noticed one box contained ornaments, jewels, and
> gold articles. The other box, she noted, contained books, papers, and
> writings. The maidservant hid the box of the jewels in the stove and cast
> the other box from the kitchen’s chimney into the street. This latter box
> contained treatises and sacred writings, and also included the copy of a
> missive to the Holy Land that the entire family numbering forty or ﬁfty
men and women had signed.

On her way to mosque early next morning, the daughter of Mírzá [p.265]
> Muhammad-Ridá Mustawfí, who was a very temperamental and acrimo-
> nious woman, noticed the box behind the home of Muhammad-Qásim
> Khán. Having taken the box home, she noticed that it was ﬁlled with
> Baháʾí writings and materials. She also found the supplication [to the Holy
> Land] and was thrilled by discovering in such a document the perfect
> means for causing mischief. After considering the contents, she took the

> box and its contents to an ostentatiously pedantic mujtahid known as
Siyyid ʿAlí-Akbar Fál-Asírí,212 who was regarded as a senseless Siyyid.

Upon perusal of the documents, the Siyyid realized that he had arrived
> at a means for great mischief and hence immediately raised the cry, “Our
> religion is lost!” He proceeded to the Masjid Vakíl, where he stirred up
> the people, exclaiming, “You must forthwith attack and destroy the home
> of [Muhammad-] Qásim Khán, and on account of this missive they have
> sent to their leader [i.e., Baháʾuʾlláh] kill the entire household!” The call
took hold across the city.

While attending the Masjid Naw, the late Mírzá Yúsuf Khán, who
> was a son-in-law of [Muhammad-Qásim] Khán, heard this call and went
> before the Khán and apprised him of the situation. Muhammad-Qásim
> Khán became extremely apprehensive and immediately inspected his
> vault, only to discover that his two boxes were missing. He realized that it
> must be the work of Hájí Murshid’s wife. He summoned the woman and
> inquired from her in this regard. At ﬁrst she denied any involvement, but
> after persistent questioning and threats, she confessed to having hidden
> the jewelry box in the oven and tossing out the box of papers through
chimney into the streets.

When the late Muhammad-Qásim Khán had learned of this, he imme-
> diately set out to visit the Prince and notiﬁed him of the occurrences
> and the involvement of Siyyid ʿAlí-Akbar. The Prince stated, “Do not be
> perturbed. If you are afraid to go home, you may stay in the governor’s
> Ark as my guest. Leave this issue to me as I know best how to extinguish
> such ﬁre and mischief.” Due to Muhammad-Qásim Khán’s previous gen-
> erosity, the Prince was awaiting an opportunity to repay his kindness and
> now found the opportune moment.

Fál and Asír are two neighboring villages near Búshihr, (Mázandarání, Táríkh

> the Tobacco Revolt of 1891–92, he incited the people of Shíráz to sedition, whereupon
> on hearing this news, the government in Tihrán exiled him to Iraq. However, his depar-
> ture caused an uproar in Shíráz that was eventually quelled through the eﬀorts of Mírzá
> Muhammad-Ridá, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk. About two years later, the Siyyid was allowed to
> return to Shíráz where he resumed his iniquitous activities. This ill-tempered, arrogant
> divine was most prejudiced against the Baháʾí Faith, and as will be seen throughout the
> present narrative, he caused the martyrdom of a number of believers: three in 1869, two
> in 1889, and one in 1892. For a biography see, Bámdád, Sharh Hál Rijál Iran, vol. 2,

Muhammad-Qásim Khán responded, “If you permit, I will take my
> leave since my wife and household look to me for support and protection,
> and if I do not go home, it would worry them.” The Prince gave him
> permission to leave and sent a few soldiers along to protect the home of
the late Khán.

Afterward, the Prince sent a message to the Siyyid stating, “I have
> heard that you have come upon some writings and documents from this
> wayward group [i.e., Baháʾís]. Please come and bring with you all these
> writings for my inspection. Together, I as the governor, and you as the
> guide on religious matters, we can best decide how to conduct the aﬀairs
in the most beneﬁcial manner to the luminous religion [of Islam].”

The Siyyid was most pleased with this message, thinking that he could
> now do as he pleased through the powers of the oﬃce of the governor.
> He placed all the writings, including the list of believers and the mis-
> sive [to Baháʾuʾlláh], back into the box and took it to the Prince [the
Ihtishámuʾd-Dawlih].

[In their meeting,] the Prince extended the Siyyid immense courtesy,
> well beyond the cleric’s rank, which greatly pleased the visitor and increased
> his conﬁdence. This interview lasted more than three hours, in the course
> of which the Siyyid spoke at length—all drivel—while the Prince pre-
> tended to be listening most attentively and to be in agreement. When [p.270]
> the hour for obligatory prayer arrived, the Siyyid asked for permission to
> take his leave. The Prince granted him leave with a request for a prayer.
> The Siyyid was about to take the box when the host stated with utmost
> politeness, “It would be best if you left the box with me as a trust, that I
> may study the papers more intently this evening. Come again tomorrow,
> and together we will decide how best to administer a due punishment
> upon this wayward people [i.e., Baháʾís], as their possessions and lives are
> fair game: their possessions belong to the state, and their blood belongs
> to the people.” The Siyyid was elated with this comment, and responded,
> “I obey whatever command Your Excellency decrees. I leave this box with
> you in trust and ask that no one else interfere with its contents.” The
Prince agreed, and the guest took his leave.

Upon his departure, the Prince sent word to the Khán to come see
> him. When he arrived, he heard the details of what had transpired. The
> Prince handed him the box, declaring, “Carefully consider the contents,

> The late Khán had previously prepared a list of the box’s contents and

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 109                                                               7/10/2008 3:45:21 PM

> left it in the box. Using this list, he was able to determine that all the
> papers remained undisturbed. The Prince remarked, “Take the box, and
> do not worry any more. I will answer the Siyyid. Should a representative
> of the Siyyid come to you, without any fears, sternly rebuke him. Have
> no misgivings!” Expressing his profound gratitude and thanks, the late
> Khán took his leave and once arrived home informed the household of
> the occurrences and the wise manner in which the Prince had interceded
on his behalf. Everyone was most joyous.

The next day, relying on his previous day’s discussions with the governor,
> Siyyid [Fál-Asírí] sent a harshly worded message to [Muhammad-Qásim]
> Khán, essentially, “You are wayward and disdained. Your documents are
> with me. You have two choices. One is for you to ﬁll your boots with
> sand, rope them around your neck, barefooted and with one hand holding
> the sanctiﬁed Qurʾán and with the other holding a sword, come this very
> afternoon to the Masjid Vakíl to repent and recant, that I might pardon
> and forgive your sins. Should you fail to do so, I will issue appropriate
> fatwá against you instructing that your home be demolished and your
blood, as well as those whose names appear on the list, be shed.”

When this message was given to the Khán, he remained quiet, in some
> perplexity. The late Mírzá Yúsuf Khán advised, “Uncle, why do you not
> respond to the Siyyid?” “What am I to say?” inquired the Khán. “Allow
> me to respond in your place,” said the nephew. He then summoned the
> messenger and stated, “Convey to your master that his message for the
> Khán is like the message of Ibn Ziyád [for Imám Husayn]. When you
> have reached the stature of Ibn Ziyád, then we will do as bidden, wear
> our boots around our necks and, holding the Qurʾán and a sword, come
> in repentance. However, neither are you Ibn Ziyád, nor are we [Imám]
Husayn. Do what you can, and we will reciprocate!”

When this retort reached the Siyyid, it mortiﬁed him, and he immedi-
ately sought an audience with the Prince [Ihtishámuʾd-Dawlih] but was not
[p.275] received on an excuse. The following day, the Siyyid went for an audience

> again, but the Prince did not meet him and instead his farrashes stated,
> “His Excellency is ill.” When he returned the third day, he was told that
> the governor had gone hunting. He submitted a missive, only for it to
> remain unanswered. The Siyyid then realized that the Prince was making
excuses and was not of the same mind. He was outraged!

On the ﬁfth day, the Prince met with him. At ﬁrst, the Prince spoke
> softly with the Siyyid, who asked for the return of his trust. “I have
> not completed my study of the box’s contents,” the Prince responded,

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 110                                                                    7/10/2008 3:45:21 PM

> “and a few more days of reading are required. I will then decide on the
> appropriate disposition of this case.” “The religious ruling on this matter
> resides with me,” the Siyyid stated, “and there is no doubt left in me
> that [Muhammad-] Qásim Khán is a Bábí, as all these books and writ-
> ings are theirs. The life and possessions of these people [i.e., Baháʾís] are
> permissible to us.” The Prince retorted, “Why do you speak such things?
> If such books were found in any house, would they prove the owner a
> Bábí and his property and blood forfeited?” “If he were not a Bábí,” the
> Siyyid responded, “then the books of this wayward sect would not be
found in his house.”

The Prince considered the time propitious to rebut, “Siyyid, what do
> you think! Do you think the aﬀairs of government are left to men like
> you, to do as you please and allege all manner of unseemly slanders on
> distinguished people? I too keep copies of the Zoroastrian books, and the
> Old and New Testaments at home. Should it then be said that the Prince
> is a Zoroastrian, a Jew, or a Christian? What rubbish do you speak? Even if
> [Muhammad-] Qásim Khán did own diverse books, he cannot be accused
> of certain transgressions!” The Siyyid then realized he had miscalculated
> and that the Prince was furious. As he no longer had any evidence in
hand, he collected himself and kept his peace.

The Prince then ordered a water-pipe be brought in for the Siyyid and
> also his own golden water-pipe be prepared too. As they drank coﬀee, the
> Prince stated, “Siyyid, I swear on the royal robe, should you transgress
> your bounds and become the author of mischief, I will expel you from
the city.” In such wise, he dismissed the Siyyid from his presence.

The Siyyid remained home for a few days nursing his wounded pride

> ʿAlí-Akbar [Fál-Asírí] had waxed in enmity, animosity, and hatred [towards
> the Baháʾí Faith]. Each day he sought an opportunity to perpetrate trouble
and interference.

The celebrated Murtidá was a painter by profession and before his

> Sádát, who was an opprobrious and conniving man, deeply antagonistic
> towards the Cause. This uncle went before Siyyid ʿAlí-Akbar [Fál-Asírí]

[p.280]    Siyyid ʿAlí-Akbar [Fál-Asírí] sent his men213 to seize that wronged one

curse those I do not know,” ﬁrmly responded [Murtidá].

Verily, we are God’s, and unto Him shall we return.216

We have turned from the Arabic tongue to the Persian that all may
understand the divine purpose and attain to it.

O Afnán, be not sorrowful on account of that which hath befallen thee.

> This world of being at all times shows men its pages and testiﬁes in the

> The holy tree, the Sadra of God hath called thee Afnán. This is a great
> bounty, a high station. Protect this station through the power of His name [p.290]

At this point, the Tablet switches into Persian.

and teaching of the Cause of God.

This Wronged-One hath from the earliest of days made mention of the

> Ponder the great aﬄictions that have befallen Me, the sorrows that have
> descended upon Me, the Wronged-One of the world. From the ﬁrst days,
> I have arisen before the face of men, be they rulers or divines, and for the
> sake of the one God without veil or covering have I invited them to the

> and clear to the possessors of discernment and to them whose eyes are ﬁxed
> upon the Most Great Vision, that I have sought no advantage for Myself

> This Servant hath always loved silence, for the ears that are worthy of

> conditions saying, ‘Verily, I am God; there is none other God but Me, the
> Lord of all things, and all things other than Me are My creation. O my
creation, worship ye Me!’ ”

And also in reply to one of the Letters of the Living, making mention of
> Him Whom God shall make manifest, He saith, “I am the ﬁrst to believe
> in Him.” Repeatedly, He [the Báb] hath made mention of these utterances.
> I swear by the Sun of Truth, were it not for His sanctiﬁed mention, this
> Wronged-One would have chosen silence except in order to disclose it to
those that are prepared for it.

Praise be to God! The knowledge of the people of the Bayán appeareth

Arrival of Áqá Mírzá Ashraf, [nom de plume] ʿAndalíb in

Shíráz in AH 1306 [1888]

> After having endured great suﬀerings, aﬄictions, and tribulations in the

ʿAndalíb, pp. 471–74):

> He is the All-Powerful, the All-Mighty, the Beloved.
Oh, in life’s cup the wine-pourer of the feast of decree

Poured life-ending venom instead of spirit-elating wine.
For every ache there is a remedy, for every trouble a solution,

Oh, for this remediless ache and this balmless trouble.
The eye of creation was stunned, the world’s heart darkened,

Heart’s orchard was withered, the nightingale of life silenced.
From this loss, the pillars of existence were dismantled,

From this loss, the eternal throne was crushed.
The waves of the surging Sea of Grace were stilled; instead,

Waves of grief ’s ocean gushed in the hearts and souls of the near ones.
The banner of the Most Excellent Names fell to the dust,

The lamentation of God’s Party was raised to the high heavens.

> The One by Whose Manifestation the Day of Resurrection dawned upon the
world,

By the setting of His sun a commotion made the world to quake.
The One Who in the Sinai of nearness called, “Behold, and thou shalt see,”

Dismayed many a Moses by His roar, “Never shalt thou behold.”
The Most Mighty Ocean sunk its Ruby Ship,

Whence a tempest of tears descended from the eyes of Noah.
Thus was the king of the visible world established upon the placeless throne,

Thus the Sun-like countenance became hid in the West of the eternal Holiness.
The ear was deprived of the song of the Nightingale of Paradise,

the eye was forbid the eﬀulgence of the Sun-like countenance.
For nineteen days that heavenly Beauty was bed-ridden,

At the dawn of Saturday, second of Dhiʾl-Qaʿdah He was veiled from us.
It was the sixteenth of the Roman month of Ayar,

It was the thirteenth of the month of ʿAzamat.
Of the Persian Naw-Rúz seventy days had passed,

And of the Migration, one thousand three hundred and nine years elapsed.
Then it was this tragedy occurred, this loss appeared,

And the phrase “Verily the Lord was hidden” became the mark of this tragedy.
With mine own eyes did I behold the clear morn of the Day of Resurrection,

As it surrounded the entire the land of ʿAkká,
As for the funeral ʿAkká’s population entire, low and noble,

Gathered in Bahjí to express their faithfulness.
The Persian believers lamented fate’s unchangeable decree,

And the native Arabs cried out, “Oh our Lord, Oh our Lord!”
For the washing of the Sacred Body in the haram, the Most Mighty Branch,

Stood at service solely out of His patience, resignation, and acquiescence.
His Holiness God’s Most Mighty Branch spoke to the friends compassionately,

Martyrdom of Two Believers

> In the year AH 1307 [1889], Hájí Siyyid ‘Alí-Akbar [Fál-Asírí] issued a
> fatwá for the slaying of Karbaláʾí Hasan Khán and gave it to the Prince
> Uvays Mírzá. That very night, that wronged one was poisoned and mar-
> tyred. The following day, without the ritual ablutions or the shrouding
> of the dead, and still in the same clothes that he wore [in the prison],
> he was buried next to the Masjid Hájí ʿAbbás, outside of the city limits.
> Despite all the obstacles and dangers, that night the Sarvistání believers
> located his grave and exhumed his remains, wrapped it in fabric, and
> moved it to Sarvistan where it was interred in a most verdant orchard
owned by the Khán himself.

This deed of the Sarvistání believers was most pleasing in the presence
> of Baháʾuʾlláh, and in a Tablet revealed by the Tongue of Merciful extolling
> their great virtues, He likened them to “angelic couriers.” He also revealed
> a Tablet of Visitation for the martyred believer, in the course of which

“No one should be disturbed since God has said,

In His Kitáb-i Aqdas for all creation:
“ ‘O people, when the Sun of My Beauty has set,

And My heavenly Temple is hidden from all eyes.
“ ‘All must arise for the triumph of My Cause,

Remain assured and raise its banner the world over.
“ ‘There was a wisdom in My Manifestation, and a wisdom also in My disappearance,

None will this wisdom comprehend save God Himself.’
“Therefore must we become united in His Cause’s spread,

We must become united both in outward seeming and within our hearts.
“For teaching and triumph of the Faith we must be as one body,

Instill a new spirit by this Call into the temple of the world.
“Eleven were the Disciples of Jesus Christ;

After the passing of God’s Spirit they gave healing to world’s dwellers.
“Praised be God at present our number is several thousand,

All enlightened by the eﬀulgence and the Writings of Bahá.”
Thanks be God’s that we are all beneath the Most Mighty Branch’s shade,

The Branch of that Ancient Stock and the wave of that Ocean of Grace.
Remain constant and assured in this mighty Cause,

Patient in this tragedy, thankful in adversity.
‘Andalíb regrets that ere this tragedy struck

He did not drink a cup borne by death’s angel!

The Passing of Zahrá Bagum

> In the year AH 1307 [1889], the passing of the holy leaf Zahrá Sultán
> Bagum, the sister of Khadíjih Bagum, took place. From the beginning
> of her life in the Cause she sustained great suﬀerings and immense hard-
> ships, one hour of which none other could have withstood, so vehement
> were they in their intensity. What manifold angst she endured at enemies’
> hand and what adversities she bore from unrelenting foes! For years she
> longed to see her only child, [Núriʾd-Dín], and not a night passed that
> she did not shed bitter tears over her separation, nor was there a day that
> she was not moved to weep over what had befallen her.220 Her sole con-
> solation was the favors of the Blessed Beauty as communicated through
> His trusted courier, Shaykh Salmán. In accordance with the wishes of
> the Blessed Perfection, after the passing of Khadíjih Bagum, that exalted
> noblewoman resided in the Blessed House of the Báb for some seven
> years, until her benevolent soul took its ﬂight to the Abhá Kingdom and
the exalted paradise on Wednesday, 15 of Safar [11 October 1889].

Her sacred remains were carried in circumambulation of the House of
> the Báb and then interred next to her sister’s. . . . A Tablet [of Baháʾuʾlláh]
> revealed in honor of the sacred leaf, Maryam-Sultán<36>, the wife of Áqá
> Mírzá Áqá Afnán, bears eloquent witness to the faith and certitude of
> that brilliant lamp of ﬁdelity and that essence of constancy. That Tablet
> of Visitation is quoted in its entirety in these pages that the reader may
> discern her spiritual attainments:

Several of Baháʾuʾlláh’s Tablets addressed to him are in INBMC 51:441–47,
> nos. 446–54. A description of this twin martyrdom is given in Mázandarání, Táríkh
Zuhúruʾl-Haqq, vol. 6, pp. 874–76.

As noted earlier, in order to protect the believers of Shíráz, Núriʾd-Dín left Iran for
more than 16 years and lived ﬁrst in India and then in Egypt.

Glorious.

> He is the Consoler, the Comforter, the Beloved, the Most Generous.

O ye Leaves of My Divine Lote-Tree! Upon ye be the Glory of God, the
Lord of both worlds.

O ye fruits of My Tree of Bounty! Upon ye rest the Light of God, the
Luminous, the Radiant, the Eﬀulgent!

O ye remnants of My Afnán. The Sadratuʾl-Muntahá in the Supreme

Powerful, His Wondrous Pen.

I swear by the righteousness of God! Thine aﬄictions and all that hath
> befallen thee grieved Me, and grieved them that circle round Me and
> hold fast unto the cord of My generosity and My mercy that hath sur-
> rounded all who are in the heavens and on earth. Unceasingly, mention

> loving-kindness are turned in thy direction. Even though a great calamity
> hath descended upon thee, yet, since its origin and end are from God and
> unto God, no harm attacheth thereto. We beseech the One True God that
> He may transform the ﬁre of grief into the light of joy and that He may
> sanctify the garment of detachment and trust in God from the dust of
> worldly vicissitudes and the smoke of the vain imaginings of the peoples
> of the world. What befell thee in the path of God were the greatest aﬄic-
> tions of the world. How many the nights and days that thou wert sad-
> dened by the cruelties of the people! And among the most great suﬀerings
> is the separation that hath transpired and come between Us. Know thou
> of a certainty that a station is ordained for thee that, were its glory to be
> disclosed to an extent less than the needle’s eye, all would abandon that
> which they possess for that which is with God and would circle round
the Throne.

The oppressors and the wayward of the world, following their fancy, are
> engaged in destroying the Faith of God, but all that hath come to pass hath
> led to the gloriﬁcation of the Cause. The powers of the world are impotent
> to weaken His might, nor can His strength be aﬀected by the fabrications
> of the people. From the inception of the Cause till now, We have aided the
> Cause with Our Pen, until it hath become the cause of astonishment and
wonder for all the peoples.

The Words of the Exalted Ones are revealed in both the eloquent Arabic

> Most Great Name amongst mankind, rest upon thee O thou dayspring of
> ﬁdelity, who hast been mentioned by the Tongue of Abhá in the Prison
City of ʿAkká.

I bear witness that thou didst hearken unto the summons from the earli-

> and didst seize the cup of divine knowledge and didst drink of what was
> proﬀered therein by the hands of bounty and grace. Thou art the one

Beginning and the End.

May the ﬁrst light dawning and shining from the horizon of God’s bounty

Blessed art thou O my handmaiden! And blessed too are whoever hath
sought thy grave and hath visited thy resting-place and hath striven after
[p.305]          nearness unto God, and hath made mention of that which the Supreme
Pen hath mentioned of thy aﬄictions and calamities.

CHAPTER ELEVEN

EVENTS OF EARLY 1890s

> After Zahrá Bagum’s passing, the Blessed Beauty granted permission to [p.306:1]
> Áqá Mírzá Áqá Núriʾd-Dín to bring his family and kin from Shíráz [to
> Port Said, Egypt] and in their company to journey to the Holy Land. In
> accordance with His command, the Afnán wrote to Áqá Mírzá Áqá<53>,
> the celebrated son of Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí Afnán, in Shíráz and
asked him to arrange the family’s immediate departure.

Thereupon, the holy leaf Maryam-Sultán Bagum arranged for the mar-
> riage of Áqá Mírzá Jalál<75>, her second son, and placed him in charge
> of the protection and maintenance of the Blessed House of the Báb in
> Shíráz. The remainder of the household, that is, Hájí Mírzá Buzurg<76>,
> Hájí Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh<71>, Hájí Mírzá Diyáʾ<72>, Hájíyyih Tubá
> Bagum<73>, Hájíyyih Zívar-Sultán, who was the mother of Áqá Mírzá
> Hádí Afnán<96>, together with two attendants, Áqá Muhammad-
> ʿAlí Káshání and Hájí Subráb, departed on Friday, 24 Safar AH 1308
[9 October 1890].

From Búshihr, we sailed for Port Said and then to the Holy Land. At
> that time, the present writer was only fourteen years of age. The leader
> of our travel party was my brother, Hájí Mírzá Buzurg, who was sixteen
> years old.

Martyrdom of Murtidá

> During this interval, Muhammad-Taqí Mírzá, the Ruknuʾd-Dawlih, was
> appointed governor-general of Fárs and came from Tihrán to Shíráz. By
> then, the celebrated Murtidá had been in prison for ﬁve years. When in
> AH 1310 [1892] the news of the Blessed Beauty’s ascension had reached
> Fárs, Murtidá—that singular thrall of his Divine Beloved—lost all restraint
> and begun to lament and sob most intensely. This detail was reported to
> Siyyid ʿAlí-Akbar [Fál-Asírí] who congregated with certain other ʿulamá of
> the period, including Shaykh Ahmad Shánih-Sáz, Mullá Ahmad Mahallátí,
> Shaykh ʿAbduʾl-Jabbár, Shaykh Táhir ʿArab, and Mírzá Hidáyatuʾlláh Dast-
> Ghayb. Collectively and unanimously, they signed a fatwá for Murtidá’s
> martyrdom in the presence of the Ruknuʾd-Dawlih, stating, “You must

> slay him this very day.” Having the required religious ruling in hand, the
governor-general ordered the martyrdom of that wronged-one.

It was a blistering summer afternoon that day. The executioner went to
> the dungeon to retrieve the prisoner and to accompany him to Maydán
> Túp-Khánih222 for the discharge of the sentence, which was for the pris-
> oner to be blown from the mouth of a cannon. Upon seeing his victim,
> the executioner informed that brave lover of the ﬁeld of sacriﬁce of his
> expected fate and in chains extracted him from his cell. At the prison
> gate, Murtidá paused and, with utmost delight and serenity, removed
> his hat and presented it to the executioner, saying, “Of all the worldly
[p.310] possessions, I have but this hat. As a reward for bringing me this most

> wonderful tiding, I wish to present it to you as a gift!” Then, with the
utmost aﬀability, he handed his oﬀering to the executioner.

Soon that wronged-one was brought out to the Maydán, where a
> multitude had gathered to witness the event and a cannon was readied.
> Murtidá asked for water. Thinking that he wished to have his last drink
> of water, the executioner brought him some.223 That love-intoxicated soul
> took the water and with it performed his ablutions and then stood facing
> the Holy Land [ʿAkká], and freely and with a resonant voice recited his
> obligatory prayer, followed by the chanting of a long prayer. Thereafter,
> he turned to the executioner, saying, “I have completed my duties. You
must now discharge yours.”

As is customary, the executioner placed a short stool in front of the
> cannon-mouth, placing that wronged-one with his back to the gun, and
> he was about to tie him with ropes, when the latter said, “There is no
> need to tie me. Tying is for thieves, wrongdoers, and highwaymen. Indeed,
> I have been yearning for this day and this blessed hour! My sole request

and gifts from the shopkeepers and the merchants.

[Moved by the bravery of Murtidá] that very day several people declared

Kish [the porter]; Khán-Ján Duzdalishny; and a number of others.

Of the ʿulamá who had refused to sign and seal the fatwá for Murtidá’s

> Shaykh Yahyá, the Imám-Jumʿih, both of whom ranked among the equi-

The Arrival of Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís in Fárs in AH 1313 [1895]

> After attaining the presence of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá in the Holy Land and gaining
> indescribable spiritual insights and manifold celestial understandings, Hájí
> Abúʾl-Hasan Mírzá, known as Hájí Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís, arrived in Shíráz by
> way of the port of Búshihr.226 He resided temporarily in Shíráz for several
> months before proceeding [ﬁrst to Isfahán and then] to Tihrán.

A description of Murtidá’s martyrdom is given in Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhuruʾl-
Haqq, vol. 5, pp. 373–74, and vol. 6, pp. 875–76.

Since during his ﬁrst sojourn the weather in Shíráz had been particularly
> vivifying and the condition of Fárs most agreeable, he decided to return
> and settle for a longer period. He established a beﬁtting home, and initially
> the distinguished ʿulamá openly and warmly welcomed him.
[p.315]    The venerable Hájí Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís established his classes at Masjid

> Naw, near the [Shrine of ] Siyyid Mír Ahmad Sháh-Chiráq, which is a
> spacious and vivifying area, and there he would preach and deliver sermons.
> Truly and in all fairness, he was singular in eloquence and the ability to
> preach and teach from pulpits and at other public gatherings. Often it
> was witnessed that he delivered a discourse on a single theme for some
> four hours, completely sustaining the interest of his audience. All his
> sermons were aimed at the ediﬁcation and awakening of the people, to
> the point that those among his seminary students endowed with discern-
> ment would write down his lectures verbatim and copy them for others.
> Gradually, through the circulation of these notes, all citizens were greatly
> attracted to his lessons. During the morning hours, he would have his
> classes at his own residence where a large group would receive tuition.
> Several among his foremost students recognized the truth of the Faith
and numbered as his conﬁdants.

Áqá Mullá ʿAbduʾlláh Fádil, surnamed Rafíʿ-Badíʿ, whose suﬀerings and
> services were mentioned earlier in this narrative, was greatly attracted to
> the honored Shaykh upon ﬁrst meeting him and discerned spiritual attain-

> unworldly sagacity. He versiﬁed a number of questions and together with
> several loafsugars sent these to the Shaykh, with the purpose of ascertaining
> the convictions of the latter.227 The Shaykh, [being a most accomplished
> poet in his own right,] also responded in verse, and this exchange was
> indeed most instructive and extensive. To the extent that these poems have
come to my possession, I will include them in these pages.228

In short, [through these exchanges,] veils were removed between the
> celebrated Fádil and the esteemed Shaykh, and the former would often
frequent the abode of the latter to spend time in each other’s company.

After Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís made a ﬁrm decision to remain in Shíráz, he
> began to form marital unions with inﬂuential and prominent citizens. He
> gave his eldest daughter in marriage to Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim, the Fakhruʾl-

Because of his fame and Qájár background, Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís was directed by ʿAbduʾl-
Bahá to conceal his conversion to the Baháʾí Faith.

Khán Kurraní, who was among the aﬄuent landlords of Shíráz.

These unions further fueled the envy and jealousy of the ʿulamá, as they

God willing, the rest of his account will be told in the course of the

Departure of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Núriʾd-Dín

> After sixteen years away, in accordance with ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s instructions,
> Núriʾd-Dín left Egypt for Shíráz and to meet en route with the late Áqá
> Mírzá Muhammad-Hasan [Mírzáy-i Shírází], the Hujjatuʾl-Islám [the Proof

> other chronicles, it is propitious that it be narrated in these pages so that
> kind mention is made of that singular steward of the world of humanity.
That story and the reasons behind the meeting are as follows.229

In the year AH 1312 [1894],230 [Sáhibih-Sultán Bagum], the mother
> of Áqá Siyyid Muhammad-Husayn Afnán, together with her daughter
> [Fátimih-Sultán Bagum<42>], who is the mother of Muvaqqaruʾd-Daw-
> lih<99>, visited the ʿAtabát. [In the course of their visit], they went to
> the residence of the esteemed Mírzá Hujjatuʾl-Islám in order to introduce
> themselves to him.

A diﬀerent translation of this interview formerly appeared in Balyúzí, Eminent
> Bahá ʾís in the Time of Bahá ʾuʾlláh, pp. 252–60. A summary is in Mázandarání, Táríkh
Zuhúruʾl-Haqq, vol. 6, pp. 1013–15.

Núriʾd-Dín’s letters from Búshihr are extant and are dated AH 1311 [1893]. There-
fore, most likely “1312” is a copyist error, and the actual date is AH 1311.

[p.325]       After the exchange of customary formalities, the mother said, “I am the

> wife of the late Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim<11>, and this is my daughter.
We ask your special blessings and favors.”

> “Which Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim?” he asked.
> “The maternal uncle of Áqá Mírzá Áqá<24>,” she replied.
> “Which Áqá Mírzá Áqá?”
> “The son of the late Mírzá Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín.”
> Then he remembered who it was and said, “The Áqá Mírzá Zaynuʾl-
ʿAbidín who [lived] near the gate of the Masjid Jámiʿ?”

> “Yes,” she replied, and he was overjoyed.
> “Where is Áqá Mírzá Áqá now?” he then asked.

“He was living in Egypt, but it appears from what he has written that
he now intends to return to Shíráz.”

“Do you know whether he has already traveled and reached Shíráz or
not?”

> “He has not arrived as yet.”
> “How much longer are you intending to remain in the ʿAtabát?”
> “We will stay for perhaps ﬁfteen more days, and when we have com-
> pleted our pilgrimage to the ʿAtabát and the sacred city of Najaf, we will
once again attain your presence and then return to Búshihr.”

“When you return to Búshihr, if you ﬁnd that Áqá Mírzá Áqá has
> already passed through that town and is on his way to Shíráz, then let
> it be. However, if he arrives while you are in Búshihr, please say to him
> from me: ‘Be sure to come to the ʿAtabát and visit me, for it has been
> many years that I have been deprived of meeting members of my family.’
> And if you leave Búshihr before he arrives, leave a message for him with
a trustworthy person that it is imperative for me to see him.”231

The days of the pilgrimage of those two ladies at the ʿAtabát drew to a
> close, and they went to bid farewell to the Hujjatuʾl-Islám. They said to
> him, “We are taking our leave today.” He urged them once more not to
> forget his message to Áqá Mírzá Áqá and to ensure that when he came
> to the ʿAtabát, he would come and see him.

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh adds parenthetically: (The Hujjatuʾl-Islám had family ties with the
> Afnán, that is to say their fathers were paternal cousins, and he was also closely related to
> the father of the Báb. It was for this reason that he was trying to arrange the meeting.)

Meeting Between Núriʾd-Dín and Mírzáy-i Shírází

> After completing their pilgrimage, the ladies returned to Búshihr, and on
> the very same day the ship carrying the Afnán arrived at Búshihr. They
> met each other, and the ladies conveyed the message of the Hujjatuʾl-
Islám. My father related:

> I was very hesitant whether I should go and visit or to forego such an
> intention. I thought about it a great deal. Eventually, I decided that it was
> best for me to go. The same ship took me on to Basrah, and from Basrah I
> traveled to Baghdad. I sent a missive before the Hujjatuʾl-Islám saying, “In
> conformity with your exalted wish, your good message has been forwarded
> to me in which you had stressed that when I reached the ʿAtabát I should
> visit you. I am now at Baghdad. Whenever you appoint a time, I shall come
and attain your presence.”

I sent the missive through one of the ʿArab Baháʾís and instructed him
> to identify himself [as my messenger] and then deliver it. When the letter
> reached him and he realized I was in Baghdad, he sent the following reply,
> “O light of mine eyes! Dear and esteemed one! Your letter was received and
> read. Since at the present time there is much coming and going of pilgrims, [p.330]
> please remain in the Abode of Peace [Baghdad] for ﬁfteen days even though
> it may be an inconvenience to you. Then at the expiry of the ﬁfteen days,
> come here to the ʿAtabát that we may meet. I am very eager to meet that
light of mine eyes.” The same messenger brought this reply to me.

After seeing this response, I remained in Baghdad, according to the
> instructions, for ﬁfteen days. At the culmination of that time, I set out to
> Samarra with a number of the ʿArab Baháʾís. Upon our arrival, the ʿArabs
found a place for us to stay, and we settled there.

The following day I called on the honored Mírzá and found an old man
> with a radiant face, sitting with pillows around him on which he was resting.
> The people who were being admitted to his presence would kiss his hand,
> sit in his presence for an hour, and then be dismissed. Like the others, I
> went forward, kissed his hand and introduced myself. He looked at me
> and inquired after my health. He only asked, “Where are you staying?” I
> did not know, but the ʿArabs who were with me gave the address and the
> location. He did not speak to me any further, nor paid any attention to us,
> and after sitting for more than one hour, I got up and again without adding
any expressions of aﬀection, he said, “Be under God’s protection!”

I was deeply annoyed at his ignoring me and was not in a good mood.

> “What a thing to do,” I said to myself. “I have caused myself a lot of trouble
> for no reason and have come here from Búshihr to no purpose.” I was very
> oﬀended. I arrived at the place where I was staying and said to my compan-
ions, “Let us make preparations to leave at ﬁrst light tomorrow.”

At the time of the adhán [call to prayer], which was two hours before
> sunrise, I was up and drinking tea, while the others were busy collecting our
> belongings. It was just getting light, and I was looking from the window

> into the street when I saw an akhúnd coming. When he reached the door
> of our house, he called out to one of the Baháʾís whose name was ʿAlí. ʿAlí
> went by the door to speak with him, and he said, “I have a message from
> the honored Mírzá, which I want to convey to Áqá Mírzá Áqá.” ʿAlí con-
> veyed the message, and I went over and spoke with the akhúnd. He said,
> “The honored Hujjatuʾl-Islám has asked that you come to see him alone,
without your companions.”

I decided to go, but my companions said, “We cannot let you go alone.

> Anything could happen.” “These thoughts are wrong,” I replied, “he must
> want to see me about something since he has specially sent for me.” In the
end my companions agreed, and I set out without them.

The name of the akhúnd was Shaykh Hasan, and he was one of the
> intimates of the Hujjatuʾl-Islám. I went with him until we reached the door
> of the house of the honored Mírzá, where I had been the previous day. But
he proceeded on around the corner.

“The house of the venerable Mírzá is here, O Shaykh,” I said to him;
“where are you going?”

“This is the bírúní,” he replied. “He has instructed that you be taken in
through the door of the andarúní, which is private.”

He went on another twenty paces and opened a door. In the corner of
> the hallway there was a room. He opened the door and held up the curtain.
> I went in and found his honored Hujjatuʾl-Islám, as on the previous day,
> with cushions around him, lying down. I greeted him, and he replied. Then
> he said to Shaykh Hasan, “Go brew some tea and bring it. No one is to
> be permitted to come here, for it is ﬁfty years since I have seen any of my
> relatives. I want one hour free from interruption to be with him. Even the
> children are not to be permitted.” After giving these instructions, he said
further, “Also, close the door.”

And so Shaykh Hasan closed the door and left. Then he opened his arms
[p.335]          and embraced me. He wept copiously, and from his condition I began to

> weep too. He sat me down next to him and poured out expressions of
aﬀection and favor.

“I know that you were annoyed at the way we met yesterday and were
> displeased. I realized that you were angered. What can I do with such people?
> What can I do? It was for this reason that I sent Shaykh Hasan to you in
the early morning to bring you here so that I can meet you.”

> At this moment, Shaykh Hasan brought in the tea.
> “Leave it and go,” he said. “Áqá Mírzá Áqá will pour the tea.”
> Shaykh Hasan put down the tray and left. I poured some tea and oﬀered
> it to him. He said, “You drink it.” I declined but he insisted, and so I drank
> the tea. He ordered me to ﬁll up the same cup again, and he drank from it.
> Then we began speaking. He asked a few questions about where I had been
during these years, what I had heard, and which persons I had met.

> “What sort of persons?” I asked.

“Persons who have put forward claims and have caused controversy—that
is to say, people with new ideas,” he said.

I replied, “In AH 1296 [1879] when I traveled from Shíráz, I went
> to Bombay where I occupied myself in trading. Here I made friends and
> associated with Iranian and foreign merchants. I met all types of people,
> and we would discuss every kind of topic. For example, I met Hájí Muham-
> mad-Ibráhím Yazdí, who is known as the Muballigh, and he spoke of many
> important matters. When I considered what he said and weighed his words
justly, I could not refute them.”

> “Where did you go after Bombay?” he inquired further.

“In AH 1305 [1887], I went from Bombay to Egypt, and I remained
> for some time in Port Said and Cairo engaged in trading where I came in
contact with all sorts of people.”

“Where did you go from there, where did you live, and whom did you
meet?” he yet asked.

It suddenly occurred to me, from his questions, that perhaps he wanted
> to extract a confession from me and cause me trouble. But I thought about
> this and seeing that there was no one present but he and I, I thought it
> unlikely that he was planning anything. So I decided to answer his ques-
tions with wisdom.

“For a time I went to Beirut and visited some important people from
> among the notables such as Áqá Muhammad-Mustafa Baghdádí and others
like him.”

> “What did they speak of ?”
> “They spoke of the new Cause,” I replied, “and whatever they said was
> supported by proofs and evidences from the verses of the Qurʾán and the
> Hadíth of the Prophet [Muhammad] to such an extent that no fair-minded
> person could deny it. And so I wanted very much to see your honor so that
> I could ask you what my position is according to religious law and what my
moral and religious duty is. Should they be accepted or rejected?”

“O light of mine eyes! The One exalted God has created the parts of the
> body for the use of His creation that mankind may utilize each of them.
> Thus, for example, eyes are created for seeing, ears for hearing, the tongue
> for speech, hands for touching, and feet for walking, but He has created
> the heart for knowing and recognizing Him and has ordained it as the seat
> of His eﬀulgence. He has said, ‘The heart of believer is the throne of the
> All-Merciful.’ Since it is thus, Satan has no place there. And, therefore, if
> this Cause is not from God, it will have no eﬀect on the heart and being of
> a man. Whatever the heart accepts and understands must, without doubt,
come from God—it will not err.”

When I heard this reply of his, I became more conﬁdent and felt free
to speak.

“Now, the light of mine eyes, where did you go from Beirut?” he [p.340]
asked.

> “I went to ʿAkká.”
> He smiled and asked, “O light of mine eyes! What did you see and ﬁnd
there?”

> “From what point of view do you mean?”
> “From both the material and spiritual points of view.”

“From a worldly point of view, I found such majesty, power, authority,
> command, and might that no king or emperor could hope to rival. And as
> for the spiritual realm, whatever you have heard of the previous Manifesta-
> tions of God or have seen of the Books or signs of those Essences of Being
> and Manifestations of Might you will ﬁnd a more complete and a hundred
> thousand times more mighty demonstration in this Holy Personage. For
> example, from the Holy Prophet [Muhammad] the verses of the Holy Qurʾán
> were revealed in thirty sections [ juz’ ], gradually over a period of twenty-two
> years.232 From this Holy Being, that is to say, Baháʾuʾlláh, in one month ten
> times the Holy Qurʾán is revealed with the utmost precision and eloquence
> for the world of humanity. And it is such that no fair-minded man can
refute it nor produce the like of it.”

“It is indeed so, if one be fair-minded,” he replied. “I myself have seen
> some of these Writings, and they cannot be compared with the verses of
previous revelations. No, they are much more eloquent and profound.”

Then respectfully I asked, “When did your exalted self come to this
conclusion?”

He smiled and said, “Do you want to hear a confession from me then,
my son?”

“God forbid! It is only because Your Eminence is the most learned of
> mankind that I wanted to know so as to increase the certainty in my own
heart.”

“Light of mine eyes! Since you want to know, I will tell you. I was a
> young man, studying at Isfahán, when His Holiness the [Primal] Point graced
> that town with His presence. I was present at a gathering with the Imám-
> Jumʿih and the theological students at the house of Manuchihr Khán, the
> Muʿtamiduʾd-Dawlih. They were asking Him scientiﬁc questions of every
> sort, [testing His knowledge] and He was answering each one convincingly
> and with the utmost eloquence so that all of us fell into an astonished silence.
> Then one of the theological students asked a scientiﬁc question, and He
> gave a full reply. That student showed himself to be unfair and recalcitrant.
> His answer to that person decided me, and I was convinced and understood
> everything. Nor did I allow this understanding to wane. Whatever of His
> verses and commentaries came to hand, I read, and they renewed my inner,
> spiritual being. No doubt has since then entered my mind, and this outward
> glory that God has granted me is on account of the fact that I approached
this matter fairly and accepted this Cause.”

After hearing these words and becoming completely assured about that
> holy man, I said, “Now that this blessed Cause is manifest and proven to
> Your Eminence and the reins of control over millions of the Shiʿite sect are
> in your able hands, if you consider it advisable, you could make this matter
> public so that the people will be saved from ignorance and error and will
> enter the highway of right guidance.”

The Ministry of Muhammad lasted some twenty-three years.

“My sole intention was to meet you,” I replied. “I have no other busi-

CHAPTER TWELVE

TROUBLES IN ÁBÁDIH

Arrival of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Núriʾd-Dín

> Subsequent to the Afnán’s return to Búshihr in AH 1313 [1895], he [p.350:11]
> remained in that city for only a few days before proceeding to Shíráz. He
> arrived during the governorship of Muhammad-Taqí Mírzá, the Ruknuʾd-
> Dawlih, was greeted by the friends, and settled at his residence where
> the believers warmly welcomed him. Having been away for several years,
> old friendships were revived, and the gatherings were infused with a new
> vigor. After a few months, Mashhadí Husayn arrived from Ábádih, and
> having renewed their acquaintance, at his insistence, Núriʾd-Dín [and his
> family] left for Ábádih.235

Furúghí in Shíráz

> A few months later, Áqá Mírzá Mahmúd Furúghí arrived in Shíráz by
> way of Búshihr.236 En route he had became a travel companion of Siyyid
> Muhammad Aʿlamuʾl-ʿUlamá, [known as] the Mujtahid Búshihrí and the
> Thaqatuʾl-Islám, who was a brother of Áqá Najaf Isfahání,237 and [in the
> course of their conversations,] he grew cognizant that Furúghí was a Baháʾí.
> As a handsome prize, this news was brought by him to the circle of the
> ʿulamá of Shíráz who were told, “A prophet of these people [Baháʾís] has
> arrived in Shíráz.” He provided exact details, and each of the ʿulamá was
> told of the depth of Furúghí’s knowledge and achievements, and was duly
> warned of his presence in the city.

Under the feudalistic system of the time, the Afnáns were among the aﬄuent
> landlords, owning many properties throughout Fárs, including homes, farms, and other
properties in Ábádih (Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán, private communication, August 1995).

For a biography see Balyúzí, Eminent Baháʾís in the Time of Bahá ʾuʾlláh, pp. 156–70,
and Sulaymání, Masábíh Hidáyat, vol. 3, pp. 417–83.

In Baháʾuʾlláh’s Writings he is referred to as “the son of the wolf.”

Unable to contain his zeal and enthusiasm, on his arrival the celebrated
> Furúghí began organizing many Baháʾí gatherings. Each day, a large
> number of the friends would assemble in various homes [to partake of
> this spiritual sustenance]. Soon, reports of these activities were sent to the
> ʿulamá, which prompted them to cause sedition. They immediately sent
> a message to the Ruknuʾd-Dawlih, stating in essence, “A teacher of these
> people [Baháʾís] has come to Shíráz and is deceiving the citizens [into
> joining the Baháʾí Faith]. He must be summarily arrested and punished as
> a lesson to others.” The governor-general was thus compelled into issuing
orders for Furúghí’s arrest.

The news of the ʿulamá’s schemes and the collusion of the governor
> reached Furúghí that day as he participated in a large Baháʾí gathering
> in the home of Áqá Muhammad-Hasan Khayyát [tailor]. After consulta-
> tion with the friends, it was decided that, in the company of a trusted
> guide, Furúghí should leave Shíráz for Ábádih. For this mission, Mash-
> hadí ʿAbbás, a keen, righteous and agile man, was chosen, and that very
night they left the city.

The governor, however, learning of their exit, immediately sent several
> oﬃcers in their pursuit, and on the way to Zarqán he was intercepted
> and apprehended. Furúghí was brought back to the governor’s orchard,
> and the Ruknuʾd-Dawlih was informed of his arrest. The governor came
> from the Ark to the orchard where the captive was kept. He was, however,
> charmed and won over by Furúghí and ordered his Tufangdár-Báshí [the
> chief gunner] to serve as the host for the captive.
[p.355]    While a guest in his home, Furúghí succeeded in teaching the Faith

> to his host, who was ﬁlled with love and admiration for the Cause. On
hearing this, the Ruknuʾd-Dawlih was enraged [but took no action].

One day, in the course of a conversation with Furúghí, the governor
> voiced an insult [to the Baháʾí Faith], which instantly caused his guest to
> become infuriated, rebuking him, “Know well, O governor, that I possess
> a mighty serpent, and should it be unleashed, it will devour you and your
> Ark.”238 He spoke these words with such authority that the Prince was
> thoroughly overcome with fear and apologized profusely, assuring him that
> no oﬀense was intended. Thereupon, Furúghí begun to recite many verses
> of the Qurʾán and the Prophet’s Traditions that further served to deepen
> the admiration of the governor for his eloquence and learning.

The symbolism is that of Moses’ admonishment to the Pharaoh.

troubles in ábádih                                  137

During one of my pilgrimages to the Holy Land, Furúghí was also
present, and he related for me:

> One day in my absence, the Prince Ruknuʾd-Dawlih asked Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís
> if he were acquainted with me. The Shaykh denied knowing me.239 Later
> when the Shaykh was not present, the governor asked me if I knew Abúʾl-
Hasan Mírzá Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís. I replied, “Yes, I know him well.”

It so happened that on the following day, we both were in the presence
> of the Prince, and he remarked, “O venerable Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís, it is puzzling
> that you deny knowing Áqá Mírzá Mahmúd, when he states categorically
> that he knows you well. What is the meaning of this?” I quickly understood
> the wisdom exercised by the Shaykh and without a moment’s hesitation,
> interjected, “The esteemed Skaykhuʾr-Raʾís had stated that he does not know
> me because he has forgotten our previous meeting. However, if he would
> recall, one day we both were attending my father’s class, and in the course
> of conversation, the Shaykh misspoke a word that made my father angry,
> causing him to throw his water-pipe at him. Therefore, it stands to reason
that he would not remember me.”

The Shaykh promptly realized that I had spoken in a manner to cover his
> mistake and replied, “Yes, of course! You must forgive my lapse of memory.
> You are the son of the late Shaykh Muhammad Dúgh-Ábádí.240 Now I
> remember. Your late father was a man of unsurpassed merits and knowledge,
> and the esteemed Furúghí is likewise truly unparalleled in erudition and
> scholarship. But, alas, such men are not appreciated in this country and are
> only known to the keenest of men.”
> In all events, for a period of time, Furúghí stayed in Shíráz at the home
> of the Tufangdár-Báshí. Eventually, the Prince informed him one day
> that he was free to leave town in whatever direction he wished. Furúghí
> replied, “I desire to go to Tihrán by way of Ábádih. The governor oﬀered
> a mount for the journey, which Furúghí politely refused. Then the Prince
> ordered his treasurer to give him ﬁfty tumáns, stating, “Kindly use this
> money towards your journey’s expenses.” “Although I have suﬃcient funds
> for this purpose, it is unseemly to reject Your Excellency’s generosity,” and
> with that he took the money but immediately distributed it among the
> Prince’s attendants, farrashes, the cook, the Tufangdár-Báshí, and some
> other servants. Fifteen qarán was left, and he recognized, “Báshmáqchí [p.360]

Since ʿAbduʾl-Bahá had instructed Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís to conceal his faith, he had
> denied association with a well-known believer in order to safeguard his own precarious
situation.

One of the foremost early Bábí–Baháʾís, he was a survivor of the battle of Shaykh
> Tabarsí and served with distinction and renown in Khurásán; for a biography see Rabbani,
> The Genesis of the Bábí-Baháʾí Faiths in Khurásán.

> has also sustained troubles on my behalf,” and oﬀered him the remaining
> sum. The Ruknuʾd-Dawlih was ﬁlled with wonder and admiration by this
display of benevolence and magnanimity.

At last, he left accompanied by two of the Prince’s soldiers who were
instructed to provide protection as far as Zarqán. Furúghí related for me:

> These two soldiers only had a single gun between them, and en route I
> heard them comment to one another, “This Akhúnd is a Bábí, and it is
> best that we kill him from behind.” On hearing their whisper, I realized
> they were set on murdering me. When we reached a brook, I asked my
> attendant, Mashhadí ʿAbbás, to prepare tea, and I began to converse with
> the two soldiers. While they were busy talking, suddenly, I seized the gun,
> held the barrel while threatening them with its butt, saying, “If you dare,
> just come closer! You may think that I am just an akhúnd and that you
> can kill me. But you are wrong; I am a Khurásaní and can defend myself
against a hundred like you!”

Realizing that I had the upper hand, the soldiers begun to apologize
> for their misdeed, and when we reached Zarqán and met the believers, I
> returned their gun and gave them a gratuity.

Mischief in Ábádih 241

> After a sojourn of one night, Furúghí departed for Ábádih and arrived at
> the home of the Afnán.242 His entry coincided with the wedding of [my
> eldest brother,] Áqá Siyyid Áqá<74> to the daughter Dáʾyí Husayn,243
> and the honored Furúghí presided over the marriage ceremony, which
> was carried out in accordance with Baháʾí laws. However, on hearing
> this news, [Mullá Muhammad-Husayn,] the Imám [Jumʿih of Ábádih
> and a brother-in-law of Dáʾyí Husayn,] thought he was slighted and

The Ábádih incident is also told by Áqá Mírzá Qábil Ábádiʾi in his valuable unpub-
> lished history, Táríkh Ábádih va Tavabiʿ, (147 pages in the author’s hand, chapter “The
> Sixth Event”, pages 40–55), henceforth referred to as Qábil. There are some additional
> notable details provided by Qábil, as well as some diﬀerences between his version and
> the present document by Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh. To the extent practical, these are noted
> below. For a biography of Mírzá ʿAbbás Qábil, see Sulaymání, Masábíh Hidáyat, vol. 2,
pp. 182–234.

Qábil, p. 40, notes that in the company of Núriʾd-Dín, Furúghí arrived at Ábádih
> on 17 Dhiʾl-Qaʿdih AH 1313 [30 April 1896]. On the same day, Qábil himself arrived
> from Yazd. On page 41, Qábil notes that Furúghí had just returned from the Holy Land
> and in his meetings, urged the friends to steadfastness in the Covenant and avoidance of
Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí and other opponents of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá.

Qabil, p. 2, notes that he was a son of Karbaláʾí Muhammad-Taqí and surnamed
“Báʾyí” [enduring] by Baháʾuʾlláh.

to his oﬃce.244

For several days thereafter, most enjoyable and beﬁtting [Baháʾí] gather-
> ings and assemblies were organized in Ábádih when, suddenly, the news
> of Nasiriʾd-Din Sháh’s assassination reached that region.245 Simultaneous
> with this, Siyyid Yahyá Khán Tafríshigar, the Hishmat-Nizám, and two
> regiments under his command arrived [from Tihrán] in Ábádih on their
> way to Shíráz. The akhúnds seized this opportunity and persuaded the
> Hishmat-Nizám to act against the Baháʾís. Consenting to their request,
> he ordered his men to encircle the residence of the Afnán and to arrest
> the household, considering this seizure would yield great beneﬁts. They
> intended to arrest Áqá Mírzá Áqá Núriʾd-Dín Afnán; Áqá Siyyid Áqá
> Afnán; Áqá Mírzá Diyáʾ Afnán; Furúghí; Hájí ʿAlí Khán; Dáʾyí Husayn;
> Mírzá ʿAtauʾlláh Khán Sirájuʾl-Hukamá [the lamp of physicians]; Áqá
Mírzá Husayn; Qábil [Ábádiʾi]; and some other believers.246

Fortunately, the Imám’s sister [Bíbí Bagum Ján] overheard their discus- [p.365]
> sions and quickly informed her sister, the wife of Dáʾyí Husayn, “[Our
> brother] the Imám and the Hishmat-Nizám are planning to arrest the
> Afnán and a number of other [Baháʾís]. It is best for them to leave quickly
and not be here when the gunmen arrive for this purpose.”

That day, it so happened that Furúghí, the Afnán, and some others
> were the guests of Hájí ʿAlí Khán. At once, Dáʾyí Husayn’s wife informed
the Afnán of the mischief that was brewing.

The soldiers came to Dáʾyí Husayn’s home and failing to ﬁnd the believ-
> ers, were led by the rabble to Hájí ʿAlí Khán’s residence. On gaining their
> destination, without any warning, two of the men entered the dwelling
> where they found the honored gentlemen [Baháʾís] gathered around a
> table in the midst of garden and Furúghí, with his striking ﬁgure and
> enchanting voice, occupied in chanting the Holy Verses. The soldiers noted
> that Mullá Husayn who was a brother of the Qádí, the Afnán, Furúghí,

Ábádih has had a checkered history of Baháʾí persecution. Many of these episodes
> are described in detail in Qábil. One early incident is told in Mázarandání, Táríkh
Zuhúruhʾl-Haqq, vol. 5, p. 93.

The monarch’s assassination by Mírzá Ridá Kirmání took place on 19 April 1896.

Qábil, p. 42, notes that the Imám-Jumʿih connived with a number of other clerics
> in presenting the Baháʾís as the Sháh’s murderers and as engaged in preparation of war-
> fare against the state. This accusation caused the Ruknuʾd-Dawlih to become particularly
> apprehensive of the situation. According to Qábil, the Hishmat-Nizám was ordered by
> the governor to remain in Ábádih to ensure the security of the region and if necessary,
> to seize and imprison the Baháʾí leadership.

> Hájí ʿAlí Khán, and Dáʾyí Husayn were present. They said to Áqá Mírzá
> Mahmúd [Furúghí], “Our master has summoned you.” However, Hájí
> ʿAlí Khán and Dáʾyí Husayn advised Furúghí not to heed their request,
> but that instead they would go with the men to determine what was
> being planned. Eventually, Hájí ʿAlí Khán and Dáʾyí Husayn convinced
the soldiers that they would go with them instead.247

When they arrived at the residence of the Hishmat-Nizám, he instructed
> his men to detain these two and to return for the arrest of Furúghí as
> well. The recruits carried out this order and disrespectfully and insolently
> brought Furúghí before their commander. Upon arrival, Furúghí spoke
> softly and conﬁdently, but as the Hishmat-Nizám was partially deaf, he
> did not understand his words and spoke in a harsh and impertinent tone.
> Noting that the Hishmat-Nizám was particularly hearing-impaired and
> unaware, Furúghí produced a letter in the hand of the Ruknuʾd-Dawlih
> ordering all the oﬃcials and chieftains of the region to show utmost
> respect and consideration towards the person of Mírzá Mahmúd [Furúghí].
> Seeing this command, the Hishmat-Nizám ordered two of his soldiers to
> accompany the Furúghí out of city for a distance of two days’ journey
> and to abandon him there. Thus, he was expelled from Ábádih, and once
> having reached two days’ journey north of town, the two soldiers stripped
> him of his possessions, including his clothing. For two days and two
> nights, desolate, hungry, and cold, Furúghí was stranded in the outlying
mountainsides of Ábádih.

Hájí ʿAlí Khán and Dáʾyí Husayn were freed after being compelled to
> pay a ﬁne of one hundred and ﬁfty tumáns.248 Qábil was severely beaten

ﬂed to Yazd.249

The Imám continued to pressure the Hishmat-Nizám into further

> saying, “Áqá Mírzá Áqá is the chief of Baháʾís and must be apprehended.

Qábil, p. 43, gives the date of this event as 1 Dhiʾl-Hajjih AH 1313 [14 May
1896].

Qábil, p. 47, indicates that these two men remained in the prison for the duration
of the troubles. The same source, page 50, indicates that the ﬁne was 300 tumáns.

Qábil, pp. 45–47, gives a detailed account of a severe beating that he received dur-
> ing this period. Further, in pages 49–50, he gives the details of his presentation to the
> Hisámu’s-Saltanih on 22 May, implying that he must have been in prison for the duration

> Mírzá Áqá and his sons, Áqá Siyyid Áqá and Mírzá Díyá’. Once they are
> arrested, you can readily reduce all the rest and win their possessions.”
> Exceedingly pleased with this plan and proposal, the Hishmat-Nizám left
its execution to the Imám.

Three hours into that night, Bíbí Bagum Ján, the Imám’s sister, again
> quickly took the news to her sister, the wife of Dáʾyí Husayn, “Our perﬁdi-
> ous brother, the Imám, has plotted against Áqá Mírzá Áqá, his sons, and
> your husband. In secret I have come here to inform you so that tomorrow,

> since he was not familiar with the town. She responded, “Our neighbor,
> Áqá Hasan, though not a Baháʾí, is a virtuous man, and his house has a
> turret in which you can hide for a while.” Gaining his consent, she then
spoke with Áqá Hasan’s wife who also agreed to this arrangement.

At dawn, the Afnán along with Áqá Siyyid Áqá, Áqá ʿAbdul-Hamíd

The Ordeals of the Afnán Women

> At the next daybreak, on the instructions of the Hishmat-Nizám, the
> soldiers led by ʿAskar Khán and his gunmen proceeded to the house of
> Dáʾyí Husayn. They loudly knocked on the door. ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd’s wife

> entered from the neighbor’s adjoining rooftops. Overcome with fear, the

My mother related to me:
[p.375]          We were intensely immersed in our imploration and had remained so quiet

> that the soldiers and the rabble thought that we were actually men hiding
> under the cover of chadors. After the militia and ʿAskar Khán’s gunmen
> entered the house, the people of Ábádih, men and women alike, rushed
> inside as well, and it was only after repeated and forceful protestations by
> Dáʾyí Husayn’s household that the commander of the soldiers instructed his
> men to shut and bolt the main doorway and prevent any further unauthor-
ized entrance or exit.

Before they could shut the door, however, a thirteen-year-old black maid-
> servant of Dáʾyí Husayn, ran inside the house. As she was being chased by
> the gunmen who were intent on injuring her, she took refuge next to the
> Afnán’s daughter who was sitting next to her mother. The commander of
> the soldiers ordered his men to beat the young girl so they could learn from
> her the whereabouts of the fugitives. As enjoined, the rogues proceeded to
> beat the child, whose name was Shírín, with clubs and the butt of their
> guns while barking orders that she must confess the hiding place of the
> Baháʾí men. During a moment of relief, she threw herself on the knees of
> the Afnán’s daughter [Tubá], who, no longer able to endure this grotesque
> scene of injustice and unable to contain her indignation over the assailants’
> brutality, shouted back, “Why do you beat this wretched child and make her
> suﬀer so? If you are charged to take our lives, then shoot us and be done!
> What simpleton fools are you to imagine that the men would divulge to us
their hiding place?! Shame on you! Pity on you! Leave this child be!”

On hearing the Afnán’s daughter speak so forcibly, the soldiers withdrew
> and informed their commander that the two under the chador were wom-
> enfolk and decided it was best to leave the house.

> ʿAskar Khán returned to the Imám and reported, “Our search of the
> residence failed to discover the [Baháʾí] men, and brutalizing their women
> produced no result either. What do you suggest?” The Imám stated, “The
> sole remedy is to capture, torture, and torment the wife and daughter of
> Áqá Mírzá Áqá who would then tell us the men’s whereabouts. If you do
not do so, then our purpose will not be achieved.”

After they had resolved to carry out this plan, once more, the Imám’s
> sister overheard their conversation and proceeded to the house of Dáʾyí
Husayn to warn her sister of the impending fate awaiting her guests.

However, on reaching the house, she discovered the entrance was locked
> and soldiers were guarding the residence. Undaunted and after much
> pleading and beseeching, they let the brave lady in. She briefed her sister

> here, and I had to endure a thousand forms of hardship and diﬃculties
> in order to gain admittance and share the news with you, that you might
> plan for your own situation and that of the ladies in whatever manner
> you deem appropriate. Dáʾyí Husayn’s wife was perplexed as to how to
> inform the two ladies. Finally, they both went forward and told the wife [p.380]
> and daughter of the Afnán [i.e., Maryam-Sultán Bagum and Tubá] of
> what awaited them and advised them immediate escape. In response they
> said, “We are strangers in this town and do not know our way.” They

> the rabble plan injury and abuse towards you.” The Afnán’s wife stated,
> “Even if we wanted to ﬂee, doors are locked and the roof guarded by
soldiers! No path is left for us to take our ﬂight.”

Finding all avenues closed to them, at this hour of great peril they
> turned in prayer to the Holy Land and fervently supplicated assistance,
> “O Blessed Beauty! When we were in your sanctiﬁed presence, on many
> an occasion You told us, ‘We are with you at all times and under all

> to look upon us with favor and mercy. We fear not death or bondage,
> but we implore You not decree for women like us humiliation and assault
> at the hands of relentless men!” As they prayed, the soldiers continued
looting and plundering the rooms and the houses.

Being deeply frightened, Dáʾyí Husayn’s twelve-year-old son, Áqá Jalál,
> was hiding behind a tall shelf. In their hasty search, the soldiers were using
> bayonets to search behind the shelf when one of them struck the child and
> split his stomach open.250 Blood began to gush forth, and they mercilessly
> brought that child and threw him in the middle of the courtyard. Blood
> was covering the ground, and his mother and sisters became extremely
> distraught, wailing loudly and profusely. Seeing the situation, the com-
> mander of the armed men sent one of his men to summon a physician
by the name of Fúj, so he would sew the injury.

When the doctor arrived, he said [to the sobbing mother], “I will
> charge ﬁfty251 tumáns in advance to stitch his stomach.” The wretched
> mother cried out, “But I have no cash at home. Please treat his cut, and

lad’s injuries were self-inﬂicted, which seems rather unlikely.

Qábil, p. 53, gives the fee as ten tumáns.

> desolate mother remembered an exquisite cashmere shawl [that the soldiers
> had not managed to ﬁnd and loot] and gave that to him. [Having been
> paid in kind,] the doctor thereupon attended the wound and stitched
the cut.

Having heard all the commotion as well as the wailing and the sobbing
> of the mother, the neighborhood’s womenfolk came into the house and
> gathered in the courtyard. In the midst of her own agonies, Dáʾyí Husayn’s
> wife, however, had the presence of mind to see a perfect opportunity for
> the wife and the daughter of the Afnán to escape. She told them, “This is
> a good break to change your chadors and leave among the many women
> gathered here. No one will recognize you.” [The Afnán’s wife] inquired,
> “Where are we to go?” “With my maidservant,” she answered, “you can
> go to the home of Dáʾyí Husayn’s second wife.” “If it is a safe place,”
> she said, “then we will go.” “There is no other choice,” was the response.
> Quickly she asked them to replace their chadors for older ones common
among the villagers and to change their shoes for local wear.

Meanwhile, she appealed to the commander of the soldiers to evacu-
> ate the house of the neighborhood’s women so that she could look after
> her injured son. The commander, having pity on the woman, ordered
> his men accordingly. As all the women were leaving, the Afnán’s wife
> and daughter, together with a trusted maidservant [named Tájí], escaped,
> and thus the invisible hand of the Providence delivered them from the
> clutches of bloodthirsty wolves. As bidden by Dáʾyí Husayn’s wife, they
> proceeded in haste to the home of the second wife of Dáʾyí Husayn—a
> non-Baháʾí woman.
[p.385]    In the intervening time, after they had helped the injured lad and

> emptied the house of the neighborhood’s women, unable to ﬁnd the
> Afnán women, the soldiers returned to the Imám informing him of the
> day’s events and the escape of the Shirází women. The Imám instructed
> them, “Dusk is upon us, and therefore it is best for the soldiers to leave
the home [of Dáʾyí Husayn] and to resume the search in the morning.”

Upon arrival at the home of the Dáʾyí Husayn’s second wife, the women
> were informed by their hostess, “Since I fear the soldiers’ reprisals and
> destruction, I can only provide shelter for you until tomorrow morning.
> Two hours before sunlight, you are to leave this home.” “We are strang-

> we also do not wish to bring any discomfort, or worse yet, danger, upon
> you. God will assuredly watch over all of us. We only ask that you direct
> us to a place of safety.” “I do not know where you can go. Go anywhere

> you please,” was the response of their hostess. The guests were particularly
infuriated by this reaction.

Three hours into the night, the daughter of Dáʾyí Husayn, who was
> the wife of Áqá Siyyid Áqá<74>, arrived with her maidservant and the
> three-year-old son of Mírzá Jalál<75>, the second son of Áqá Mírzá Áqá
> Afnán. This child had accompanied them from Shíráz and was extremely
> attached to his grandmother and paternal aunt and upon seeing them,
> began to cry, “Dear aunt! Since I did not see you when you left, I thought
> the soldiers had taken you.” After much eﬀort, eventually they were able
> to calm the child. The four women and the child were wondering where
> to go next when their hostess came and pressed them to leave by saying,
> “Have you thought about what you will do? Before tomorrow’s sunrise,
> you must leave my house.” Dáʾyí Husayn’s daughter asked, “Wife of my
> father! You insist on our leaving, but where should we go?” She responded,
> “I do not know. Go wherever. I will not allow good Muslims to fall into
trouble over the fate of you Bábís!”

Sent by Dáʾyí Husayn’s [Baháʾí] wife to inquire after them, at last Tájí
> arrived and upon asking of their condition was told by the Afnán’s wife,
> “The lady of the house has told us to leave two hours before sunrise. We
> do not know what we must do.” Seeing their wretched condition, that
> trustworthy maidservant [i.e., Tájí] had promised that by the will of God,
> she would ﬁnd them a place of safety. She left and returned after two
> hours informing them that she had secured the home of one of the farm-
> ers for their stay. She pledged to come again two hours before dawn to
> accompany them there, and with that, she returned home and informed
the wife of Dáʾyí [Husayn].

Consequently, in the middle of the dark night, dressed in their old
> chadors and shoes and without informing the house-owner, they left for
> their newly located haven. The appointed house was at the end of an
> orchard on the outskirts of the village. This house had an upper chamber,
> with a single entrance, where grapes were dried to make raisins. Such [p.390]
> oven-like rooms have low ceilings, are kept extremely dark, have no air
> circulation, and are most unpleasant. In this room, they were to remain
> with a three-year-old boy who did not comprehend the gravity of the
> situation. Once more, Tájí impressed upon them not to make any noise
> lest they be heard by the neighbors. Locking the door from the outside,
she left them to await their destiny. My mother related:

> The room was so dark that we were unable to see one another and could not
> calm the child who was terriﬁed of the darkness and wanted to scream. He
> kept asking us to let him go out to play as he would on other days. When

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 145                                                                       7/10/2008 3:45:26 PM

> he saw the door locked, he grew more in agitation. All we could do was to
> tell him, “Please lower your voice. If the gunmen hear us, they will come,
> seize us, and take us away.” With this, he would be suﬃciently frightened
> to remain quiet for a little while. However, after a short time, once more,
> he would plead with us to open the door just so he could see some light,
> promising that as soon as the soldiers appeared, he would close it again.

> Indeed, it is heartrending to imagine the plight of those women and
> the depth of the poor child’s fear, coupled with not even knowing what
> may have befallen their innocent men! If one could envision such a
> scene and if one were endowed with a measure of fairness, one would
> be ﬁlled with remorse over their condition. “The curse of God be upon
the wrong-doers.”252

Hiding some bread, cheese, and a jug of water under her chador, by
> lunchtime the trusted maidservant, Tájí, returned and was able to alleviate
> their anxiety over the fate of their men by informing them that they had
> taken refuge in the mountain caves with some other Baháʾís and thank-
> fully were safe and well. God willing, I will tell the story of this mountain
journey of the Baháʾí men at a later occasion.

Yet again she left, locking the door from the outside and taking the
> key with her, and the women had to contend with the darkness and the
> heat of the attic, and a frightened child, though they were relieved over
the fate of the men.

Tájí returned an hour after dusk and opened the door, saying, “With the
> cover of darkness, it is now safe for you to come out to sit on the rooftop
> and breathe some fresh air.” As they sat on the roof, the farmer came by
> and greeted them warmly, stating, “From morning until now, I have been
> most apprehensive—almost at death’s door—fearing that someone would
> discover your presence on this property. It would be best for you to leave
tonight for another location, as it is unsafe to remain here.”

Once more, the women were bewildered as to where they might take
> refuge. Despite all the hardship it presented, they had been satisﬁed
> with this dark and suﬀocating attic, but even this was now being denied
> them. The wife of the Afnán prayed and thought hard what to do, and
> eventually it occurred to her that perchance Áqá Mírzá ʿAtaʾuʾlláh Khán,
> the Sirájuʾl-Hukamá, would provide a sanctuary for a few days until it
> became clear what the Almighty had decreed for them.
[p.395]    As such, once more Tájí was sent on this errand, and she briefed the wife

of Áqá Mírzá ʿAtáʾuʾlláh Khán of the situation. In turn, she conveyed the

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 146                                                                                 7/10/2008 3:45:26 PM

> details to the Sirájuʾl-Hukamá and asked, “The Afnán’s wife has conveyed
> a message wishing to take refuge here. How am I to respond?” “Of course,
> they may!” stated the Sirájuʾl-Hukamá, “Reply at once that they are most
> welcome. My house is like their very own. Here they will be safe, and no
> harm will come to them, as the people of Ábádih desperately need my
[medical] services and will show no disrespect toward my guests.”

Hearing this reply through the same trusted maidservant, dressed in the
> old chadors again, the ladies set out for the home of the Sirájuʾl-Hukamá
> where they were received with the utmost aﬀection and made comfortable
> at long last. When they inquired after the [Baháʾí refugee] men, their host
described their situation thus:

> After they had spent the day in Áqá Hasan’s turret, some of the friends from
> Dirghúk [village] led by ʿAbbás Khán armed themselves and came to Áqá
> Hasan’s residence about seven at night. They attained the presence of the
> Afnán and informed him, “Your stay in this house is no longer advisable.
> We will escort you to the hill-country where no one can interfere with us
> or cause harm.” Consenting to their plan and placing their reliance in God,
> Áqá Mírzá Áqá, his two sons, Áqá Siyyid Áqá and Áqá Mírzá Díyá’, as well
> as Dáʾyí Husayn and Áqá Mírzá Husayn Khán, proceeded with ʿAbbás Khán
> and other armed believers to the mountainous region of Dirghúk. Once
> other Baháʾís, such as Hájí ʿAlí Khán, learned of their whereabouts, they
also joined them in this new location.253

Áqá Mírzá ʿAbbás Qábil was seized on that very ﬁrst day and severely
> beaten with sticks. He was released after two days and two nights of
> imprisonment, whereupon he ﬂed to Yazd. However, the friends from the
> surrounding regions of Ábádih are all armed, standing guard around the
> mountain. They have pleaded with the Afnán [Núriʾd-Dín], “Kindly allow
> us to go into Ábádih and deal with the Imám as we should and punish
> him and his men as they deserve.” Notwithstanding, Áqá Mírzá Áqá has
> prevented them, enjoining on the believers to manifest kindness, saying,
> “Do not permit the least unlawful act to occur. Baháʾuʾlláh has charity to
> all. Whatever the foes may do, we must do the opposite: when they injure
> us, we must give them remedy; when they feed us bitter draught, we must
> oﬀer them sweet honey. They are unaware; they are ignorant; they are heed-
> less; they are unable to distinguish good from error. You must ﬁx your gaze
> upon the exhortations of the Blessed Beauty. Even a small conﬂict authored
> by you will enable them to regard you as the source of all ills. Never, never,
> occasion a wrong, as it will ruin the eﬀorts of all these years.”254 Through
> such appeals, he has managed to calm and still their rage.                     [p.400]

Qábil, p. 47, indicates that the entire Baháʾí communities of Ábádih, Dirghúk, and
Himat-Ábád ﬂed into the mountain fastness.

Qábil, p. 47, indicates that the leader of the armed Baháʾís, Áqá Haydar-ʿAlí Himat-

Furúghí’s Fate

> After Mírzá Mahmúd Furúghí was compelled to leave Ábádih, the soldiers
> accompanying him robbed him of all his clothing and possessions, left
> him stranded two stations outside the town, and triumphantly returned.
> Furúghí wandered in the wilderness and the mountains for two days and
> two nights—unclad and hungry—until ﬁnally with the greatest diﬃculty
> he found his way back to Ábádih. At nighttime he arrived in town and
> proceeded directly to the home of Hájí ʿAlí Khán, where he discovered
> the front gate locked and, therefore, with enormous struggle managed
> to gain entrance through a brook that ran through the property’s wall.
> Thoroughly drenched in mud and dirt, he came inside and was met by the
> widow of Hájí Muhammad-Ismáʿíl Dhabíh255 and her daughter who was
> the wife of Hájí ʿAlí Khán. They immediately took him inside, provided
> him with a change of clothing, and washed and dried his garments while
> he ate. He then inquired after the Afnán, Hájí ʿAlí Khán, and the rest
> of the friends and upon hearing of their whereabouts insisted in joining
> them that very night in the mountains. Subsequently, led by a trusted
> attendant, he set out for the mountain locations where the Baháʾís had
gathered. The Afnán used to relate:

> We were all exceedingly elated with the arrival of the much-esteemed Furúghí
> and circled lovingly around him. For us, it was as if the mountain had
> turned into the throne of sovereignty and the air now had the savor of the
> everlasting paradise. Such depth of ethereal spirituality stirred within us that
> indeed it is indescribable. For a whole day and night we were in his presence
> in the mountains. In the course of our consultations, however, we decided
> that it was best for Furúghí to proceed to Yazd. Therefore, I purchased for
> him one of Áqá Husayn Dirghúkí’s horses and arranged for other provisions
for his journey. He left in the company of an able servant.256

Subsequently, we consulted and agreed that staying indeﬁnitely in the
> mountains would not serve any purpose and that a potent remedy was
> needed. As such, we decided unanimously to cable the details to the oﬃce
> of the Prime Minister in Tihrán as well as the Ruknuʾd-Dawlih in Shíráz.

> and Hájí ʿAlí Khán, for permission to attack and free them by force. However, noting
> that ʿAskar Khán and one hundred of his men guarded the prison round the clock, the
Baháʾí captives discouraged this eﬀort.

> The text of these cablegrams were prepared and dispatched to Ábádih where
> the Baháʾí womenfolk of Ábádih, Dirghúk, and Himat-Ábád were asked to
proceed collectively to the Telegraph Oﬃce to dispatch these cables.

About three hundred Baháʾí ladies assembled at the Telegraph Oﬃce

Realizing Zál Khán’s nefarious intentions, the womenfolk informed us
> in the mountain strongholds. I said to the believers, “Now that Ábádih is

Upon the arrival of our account in Yazd, Hájí Vakíluʾd-Dawlih informed

Qábil, pp. 47–48, indicates this event took place on 7 Dhiʾl-Hajjih [20 May 1896]

Sirajuʾl-Hukamá, ʿAbbás Khán’s wife, and Hájí ʿAlí Khán’s wife.

Qábil, p. 54, indicates that he arrived in Yazd on 16 Dhiʾl-Hajjih [29 May] and
> briefed the Vakíluʾd-Dawlih of the events. Thereupon, a telegram was sent to Tihrán, and
on the following day a cable was received from the Prime Minister’s oﬃce:

> Response to the citizens of Ábádih:
[Attention of ] the illustrious Ruknuʾd-Dawlih:

Why has Mírzá Siyyid Yahyá Khán, [the Hishmat-Nizám,] the commander of the
> Hamadání forces, through the instigation of the mischievous Imám-Jumʿih of Ábádih
> and in collaboration with the scoundrel Zál Khán of the Telegraph Oﬃce, caused
> such tumult in Ábádih? And why have they caused the citizens of that region to be
> scattered on the mere accusation of being Baháʾís, and plundered their possessions
> and properties, slain or injured a number of them, and yet again extracted ﬁnes from
> some others? Of a certainty, Siyyid Yahyá Khán must move at once from Ábádih,
> and all the conﬁscated properties and possessions must be returned to their rightful
> owners and peace must be re-established.

> ʿAbbás Khán, and some others continued to remain in the mountains.
> The Afnán proceeded directly to the residence of the Sirájuʾl-Hukamá,

> their deep gratitude to their host for his hospitality, they regained their
own dwelling.

About the same time, on his way from Tihrán to his newly appointed
> oﬃce in Búshihr, the esteemed Prince [Hájí Abúʾl-Nasír Mírzá] Hisámuʾs-
> Saltanih259 [II], a son of Sultán-Murád Mírzá, the Hisámuʾs-Saltanih [I],

> verdant orchard. Upon hearing of his whereabouts and the reason for his

immediately.262

As such, the troubles in Ábádih were concluded, and peace was restored

He had received the same title as his father, and therefore the notations “I” and
> “II” are used to diﬀerentiate between the two. For a biography, see Bámdád, Sharh Hál
Rijál Iran, vol. 1, pp. 70–71.

Qábil, p. 48, gives the date of his arrival as 9 Dhiʾl-Hajjih [22 May 1896].

Not to be confused with a name of the famous building in Shíráz that for a long
period served as the residence of the governor-general of Fárs.

Qábil, pp. 50–51, states that with departure of the Hisámuʾs-Saltanih II from Ábádih,
> the Hishmat-Nizám decided to renew mischief and planned on the murder of Qábil.
However, the latter was informed of this plot and ﬂed to Yazd in the middle of night.

A.Q. Afnán maintains that this journey took place prior to the events of Ábádih
(private communication, December 1997).

Malmirí, Khátirát Malmirí, p. 126, indicates that Núriʾd-Dín remained in Ábádih
for a year.

CHAPTER THIRTEEN

PROFILE OF TURMOIL: SPRING 1903

The Journey of Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán, [Surnamed] Núriʾd-Dín, from

Shíráz—His Second Journey to the Holy Land

> In AH 1316 [1898], ʿAbduʾl-Bahá summoned the Afnán to the Holy [p.409:7]
> Land. He departed from Shíráz in the company of Maryam-Sultán
> Bagum, Túbá Khánum, and Mírzá Díyáʾuʾd-Dín and arrived in the Holy
> Land. They had the bounty of dwelling for a month under the canopy [p.410]
> of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s favors where each day they drank their ﬁll from the
> chalice of their Beloved’s inﬁnite muniﬁcence and partook of the honor
of being in His presence.

At the conclusion of the month’s stay, congruent with ʿAbduʾl-Baháʾs
> command, the Afnán went to Port Said, as Hájí Mírzá Buzurg and this
> servant [Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh] were residing in that town. My mother, sister,
> and brother, Hájí Mírzá Díyáʾuʾd-Dín, accompanied my father, the Afnán.
In that town, we were engaged in commerce.

We remained in Port Said for three years when, once more in accordance
> with ʿAbduʾl-Baháʾs command, we returned to Fárs to serve and protect
> the Blessed House of the Báb. Our entire family was permitted to travel
> [again] to the Holy Land and to remain there for some ﬁfteen days. After
> acquiring spiritual sustenance, consonant with His wish, we returned for
a brief period to Port Said and thence proceeded to Shíráz.

When the friends in Shíráz were informed of the safe transfer of the
> Báb’s sacred remains from Tihrán to the Holy Land and their interment
> on Mount Carmel, the celebrated Hájí Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís penned a poem
> in AH 1318 [1900] which marked that blessed date and submitted it to
> ʿAbduʾl-Baháʾs presence.265 This oﬀering won His high praise. . . .266

The remains of the Báb were interred in His permanent Shrine on Naw-Rúz 1909.

> For the history of events leading to this interment, see, Rabbani, “Eﬀorts to Preserve the
Remains of the Báb: Four Historical Accounts.”

The text on page 412 quotes ﬁve lines of this poem that are not rendered into
> English in the present translation. The concluding verse gives the date of this event, 1327

[1909], as the numerical value of the phrase “Hadíratuʾl-Qudsí.”

Similarly, at the time when the arch—Covenant-breaker [Mírzá Muham-
> mad-ʿAlí] had hoisted the standard of violation, Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís composed
> a missive in Arabic and a poem in Persian and sent them to ʿAbduʾl-Baháʾs
> presence as well. These two documents are truly enchanting, and upon
> their consideration, one perceives the depth of certitude, faith, and purity
of intent of this peerless and evanescent believer. . . .267

Filled with joy and spirit, the Afnán arrived in Shíráz on 18 Shaʿbán
> AH 1319[30 November 1901], with this servant and my brother, Hájí
> Mírzá Buzurg, [and the womenfolk of our family,] in his company. We
> attained the presence of the friends of the Merciful, and regular weekly
> gatherings were organized, where all the believers would come together
> in the utmost enthusiasm and unity. Moreover, with great order and
> undiminished wisdom, the friends would visit the Blessed House of the
> Báb and place their brows in humility on the Threshold of that Sacred
Ediﬁce.

In the year AH 1320 [1902], while in Tihrán, the exalted Navváb
> [Prince] Malik Mansúr Mírzá, the Shuʿáʿuʾs-Saltanih, was appointed
> governor-general of the province of Fárs.268 He arrived in Shíráz with a
> large retinue, entourage, and a regiment of soldiers, exhibiting princely
splendor and authority.

As result of his high standing, policies, and rule, Shíráz was quiet, and
> freedom reigned throughout the region. Meetings and Baháʾí gatherings
> were [regularly] organized in the utmost radiance. Áqá Mírzá Jalál Zar-
> qání and ʿAndalíb were steadfastly engaged in teaching the Cause. There
> was no hint of disturbance, and Baháʾí congregations and assemblies met
> routinely, particularly the meetings held in the homes of the Bashíruʾs-
> Sultán or Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí-Ridá Khán, where the celebrated Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís
> would grace the assemblage with his presence and all would beneﬁt from
his vast erudition.

It went thus until towards the end of the year when certain trouble-
> makers raised mischief and commotion, and tumult and uproar became
> sovereign throughout the city.

The text on pages 413–15 contains a copy this missive and poem, which have not
been reproduced in this translation.

Bámdád, Sharh Hál Rijál Iran, vol. 1, pp. 28–29, indicates that he was ﬁrst appointed
> governor-general of Fárs in AH 1318 [1900]. See appendix 3 for a Tablet of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá
> about this governor’s potential.

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh’s Injury

> It was during this time that this servant was aﬀected by an illness that
> rendered me bedridden for almost four months. Various physicians were
> brought in, such as Áqá Mírzá ʿAbduʾlláh Rahmat, who prescribed vari-
> ous odious and bitter medicines. The illness, plus separation from the
> Holy Land, induced an acute depression. Previously, for twelve years,
> I had the good fortune of being under the canopy of the Master’s love
> where my spirit would be rejuvenated through His unceasing favors. But
> now I found myself in the destitute land of Iran, ﬁrmly in the grasp of
> bloodthirsty wolves, suﬀering profoundly, and being deeply saddened and
agitated because of it.

One day after taking my medicine, I ventured to the roof of the Blessed
> House [of the Báb] and stood on the same side of the residence that the
> sacred orange tree planted by His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb]
> was located. That sanctiﬁed tree was in full bloom. I stood there that
> perchance through the fragrance of the sacred orange tree my soul and
> my entire being might be revived. I stood facing the tree in the direc-

by Nabíl Zarandí:
I did not eat the [forbidden] wheat,269 O Beloved,

Then why expulsion from Thy Ridván?
If I partook some, it was out of ignorance,

I am guilty, remorseful, and repentant.
I am a ﬁsh far from water,

Consumed by Thy separation’s ﬁre.270

> me, striking my skull over the right eye.271 The impact was so severe that [p.420]
the brick broke into many pieces and I fell unconscious.

Discovered by my brothers, I was brought down to the courtyard
[of the House of the Báb] with my eye swollen shut. Immediately, [my

The author cites only these three couplets out of the nineteen.

> a devoted Baháʾí. After examination he reported, “Currently, applying
> medicine is not advisable since it is not possible to determine if the eye

> almond oil and egg white to be slowly poured over the injury. Following
> his counsel, for three days brick remains were dislodged from my eye until
> after a week the swelling subsided somewhat, and I was able to open my
> eyelid a little, although the contours of the cornea and the eyeball were
not discernible.

Áqá Mírzá Husayn came to visit and examined my condition, and,

> became somewhat conﬁdent and pronounced, “This is nothing short of
> a miracle. It is only through the grace of this Sacred House that your eye
> has survived! Otherwise, it would have been completely and permanently
impaired.” Again, he repeated, “This is an absolute miracle!”

After investigation, it was determined that the assailant was the
> Khabíruʾd-Dawlih’s son from a Kurdish mother. He confessed to the
> act and said, “[Because he is a Baháʾí,] I hit him on purpose, hoping he
would go blind.”

During this period, I was unable to communicate with the Holy Land
> for forty days. After I had recovered to some degree, I wrote Áqá Siyyid
> Taqí Manshádí, apologizing for delay in sending missives and explained to
> him that the delay was because of an injury, describing a little of what had
> transpired. Manshádí took my letter to the presence of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá and
> described what had occurred. Immediately, from the heaven of His grace
> and bounty, an exalted and glorious Tablet was revealed in the honor of
this servant, which will beﬁttingly adorn the pages of this history:

> Shíráz. The illustrious Afnán of the sacred Lote-Tree, Áqá Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh,
> may the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, be upon thee.
He is God.

O thou oﬀshoot of the Tree of Reality! Thou hast been accepted at the

The Passing of Hájí Abúʾl-Hasan in AH 1320 [1902]

> In the year AH 1320 [1902], the passing of Hájí Abúʾl-Hasan, father of [p.425]
> Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán [Dihqán], occurred. During the early
> part of this history, and then later, his loving mention was made exten-
> sively, and the excellence of his character, the depth of his devotion, and
> the troubles he sustained were noted. Now I wish to record the incident
and injury that led to his passing, as an example of devotion unto all.

The Hájí had a particular aﬃnity towards [my father] the Afnán and
> twice weekly, that is, on Mondays and Fridays, would come visit the
> Blessed House of the Báb and meet the Afnán. At that time, the Hájí
was more than ninety years of age.

One day, his journey passed by the vicinity of the home of Siyyid ʿAlí-
> Akbar Fál-Asírí, whose malicious deeds were mentioned in the course of
> the martyrdom of the illustrious Murtidá and the incident of Muham-
> mad-Qásim Khán, and are recorded in the pages of history. The henchmen
> under the command of the Siyyid saw the Hájí [Abúʾl-Hasan] and, after
> having severely abused that bright and spiritually resplendent old man,
> took him to the Siyyid’s home. On being informed, that unenlightened
> Siyyid came forth to the front-court of his dwelling and with his cane
> brutally injured the victim. [As a result,] the Hájí became unconscious
> and was thrown into the streets by the same coarse mercenaries. Several
> farrashes of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk happened upon the Hájí and, recogniz-
> ing him, carried this old man to the home of Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-
> ʿAlí Khán and left after receiving a gratuity. The household immediately

attended to his injured father.

From that date, his son prevented him from leaving the residence, and

Withdrawal of Shuʿáʿuʾs-Saltanih

> In the same year, another incident occurred that caused general commo-
> tion and resulted in insult to Hájí Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís in the name of the
Cause and this community, and the details are these:

A year into the governorship of Prince Malik Mansúr Mírzá, the
> Shuʿáʿuʾs-Saltanih, in Shíráz, while aﬀairs were unfolding most harmoni-
> ously, certain insidious elements were eager to ﬁnd an excuse to instigate
> trouble and gradually began provocations.273 The citizens were divided into
> two factions: a large contingent who, in support of the Prince, assembled
> at the telegraph oﬃce, and a second group, led by Muhammad-Ridá Khán,
> the Qavámuʾl-Mulk, centered in Masjid Naw and [Masjid] Sháh-Chiráq,
> intent on mischief. Hájí Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís, for reasons of certain central
> authorities’ consideration, and also by virtue of his kinship, championed
> the Prince. The much-respected Shaykh Yahyá, the Imám-Jumʿih, together
> with a number of the seminarians, nobles, merchants, and shopkeepers
> congregated in the telegraph oﬃce and raising tents and shelters, camped
> in that location. The other ʿulamá, such as, Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím Mahal-
> látí, and certain others, followed the Qavám and made Masjid Naw their
place of assembly.

This incident was a perfect excuse for nefarious constituents to fuel the
> ﬁre of uproar and enmity and to poison people’s thoughts [against the
> Baháʾí Faith], and this they particularly achieved through the sermons that
> Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís had delivered, the texts of which were transcribed and
> disseminated broadly. They contrived a plot to noise abroad that “Hájí
> Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís is a Bábí, aiming to corrupt the masses and lead them
> away from the straight path into waywardness and ignorance!”

Bámdád, Sharh Hál Rijál Iran, vol. 4, pp. 156–57, indicates that Malik Mansúr
> Mírzá, being among the most aﬄuent Iranians with an enormous annual stipend, planned
> to seize Bazaar Vakíl and the shops around the Karím Khán’s quarter. However, these
> belonged to the Qavám family, who induced a popular uprising that resulted in the
> Prince’s being recalled from his post.

Using a large sum made available by Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the [p.430]
> Qavámuʾl-Mulk, and the religious rulings of Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím Mahal-
> látí and other ʿulamá, as well as the inﬂuence of the merchants and the
> rabble, they encouraged and provoked the people. Each day, gangs of
> youth, vulgar characters, and rabble carrying sticks, clubs, pistols, and
> guns would roam the bazaars and streets, and forcibly close any shop
> that was opened. They constantly incited all citizens to tumult and would
> not shy away from using unseemly language and insult to achieve their
> means. In addition, a group of Ághivlí and Bayát274 womenfolk armed
> with sticks marched every day through the city and shouted obscenities
> against Hájí Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís and the Prince, and would curse and insult
> them on allegation of being Bábís. They also would clamor and shout out
slogans, impelling and demanding the injury and slaying of all Baháʾís!

This tumult continued for nearly four months, during which time all the
> Baháʾís lost hope of life and possessions. At the beginning of the month of
> Safar AH 1321 [circa 29 April 1903], a telegraph announcing the dismissal
> of the Prince from the oﬃce was received from Tihrán. Disappointed with
> the turn of events, the Prince decided it best to conceal the news, since
> it would be a grievous stain on his prestige, and instead ordered the can-
> nons ﬁred [as a sign of celebration], proclaiming that Tihrán’s telegraph
> promoted him to a new appointment as an independent governor. Upon
> hearing the roar of the cannons, the opposition that had gathered in the
> Masjid Naw ﬂed, while the ʿulamá concealed themselves under their ʿabás
> and went into hiding in their own homes. None was left in the Masjid
> Naw and Sháh-Chiráq. Later that night, after it was determined that
> the adversary had vacated its position, the Prince, in the company of
Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís and his household and staﬀ, departed for Tihrán.

The following afternoon, on learning that the Prince was dismissed
> from the oﬃce and had quit the city, peace and tranquility became the
> norm. The Qavámuʾl-Mulk let it be known, “Our purpose was to eﬀect
> the impeachment of the Prince and the ousting of Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís, and
> none other. No one is permitted to accuse others of being a ‘Bábí’ or to
issue an insult!”

From Tihrán, the Prince Muhammad-Husayn Mírzá, the Muʾayyadu’s-
> Saltanih, who was the head of the telegraph oﬃce [and a Baháʾí], was
> appointed the city’s mayor, with Mírzá Ahmad Khán, the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih,
> as the governor-general.

The Governorship of ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih

> In the year AH 1321 [1903], the uproar of Isfahán and the incident of the
> Russian Consulate took place, which soon engulfed Yazd, and the details
> surely must have been recorded in the history of Isfahán and Yazd.275 The
> fury of that episode was also felt in Fárs. At that time, Mírzá Ahmad
Khán, the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih, was the governor-general.

[Ahmad Khán] was a powerful regent, and under his command order
> once again ruled throughout Fárs, as everyone was particularly apprehensive
> of his wrath. The governor himself would personally deliberate on all the
aﬀairs of the province.276

When the news of the occurrences of Isfahán and Yazd reached Shíráz,
> the governor increased his vigilance to ensure that similar acts were not
> perpetrated in his realm. In this regard, he had the conﬁdence and sup-
> port of: Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk; Habíbuʾlláh Khán
> Bíglar-Baykí; Prince Muhammad-Husayn Mírzá, the Muʾayyadu’s-Saltanih;
> Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán, the Amír-Panjih [commander] of the Farídání regiment,
> [known as the Muʿazamuʾd-Dawlih]; and Colonel Ahmad-Qulí Khán.

A.Q. Afnán states: “From the beginning of Rabíʿuʾl-Avval of AH 1321 [28 May–27

> June 1903], the clamor of malice and enmity was noised abroad throughout many towns
> of Iran. It that same year, more than eighty destitute Baháʾís were martyred in Yazd,
> and the earth of that region was reddened and ennobled with the blood of these souls.
> Contemporaneously, out of fear of the perﬁdiousness of Áqá Najafí and the treachery of
> Zilluʾs-Sultán, the friends of God in Isfahán took refuge in the Russian Consulate” (private
communication, September 1997).

Based on his father’s recollections, A.Q. Afnán writes (private correspondence,
September 1997):

> From the beginning of his regime, the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih had the custom that he would
> devote Saturdays to investigating the complaints of various Shírázís, such as merchants,
> nobles, and shopkeepers. The rest of the week, he would spend on other matters
> pertaining to the administration of the province. Since he was a capable, yet severe
> and heartless person, and was particularly known for his foulmouthed expressions,
> people were deeply frightened of him and would try not to create a circumstance
> that would require his intervention. His other custom was that all complaints had
> to be presented in writing, whereupon the text would be read aloud in his presence
> and he would order the immediate summoning of parties and an investigation,
> and then he would pronounce decisions. On occasion, he would delegate the task
> of inquiry to others, such as the ʿulamá or the dignitaries, who had to report their
> ﬁndings on the following Saturday, at which time, he would issue the ﬁnal ruling
> in the presence of both parties. He also had the habit of immediately enforcing
> his decision and punishing the guilty, and if he found the initial complaint to be
> invalid, often it was noted that he would force the petitioner to eat his entreaty and
> to receive a beating.

> These men were aligned with the governor in ensuring that no protest
would be aired.277

In the midst of this, reports of the events of Zarqán were received.

> That is, Akhúnd Mullá ʿAlí-Akbar Zarqání had provoked the populace
> of that town to attack and severely injure Ustád Ahmad Malikí-Dúz [the
> shoemaker] and to persecute other believers. When this news reached
> Shíráz, Áqá Mírzá Jalál Zarqání, son of Mullá ʿAbduʾlláh Biká’, who was
> previously mentioned in these pages, decided to protect the Cause. In
> consultation with ʿAndalíb and certain others, they wrote a petition to

anguish of Baháʾís at the hand of unjust people.

This appeal was written without the Afnán’s knowledge and given to

After reading the content, the Ásifuʾl-Mulk was bewildered and decided

> that the Qavámuʾl-Mulk would inform him of the decision.

Many of the upper echelon of the administrative machinery of Fárs were Baháʾís, and

(The Promulgation of Universal Peace, p. 238).

One of the devoted Baháʾís of that era.

He was a Baháʾí, and as such, his brother, though not a believer, had a particular
aﬃnity for the Baháʾís.

Immediately, the governor summoned the Qavámuʾl-Mulk and stated,
> “If you know certain of these people [Baháʾís], admonish them that now
> is not the time to raise such issues. Prudence is necessary, not open asser-
> tion of the rights for Baháʾís!” In response, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk expressed
> his readiness to undertake the mission and subsequently returned to his
duties.

Certain insidious and evil-minded persons in that gathering had learned
> that the Baháʾís had submitted such a petition to the governor and as such
> launched tumult in the streets, neighborhoods, mosques, and other places
> of gathering. They commenced insult and slander [against the Baháʾí Faith]
> and spread the details of the occurrences of Isfahán and Yazd throughout
> the city. Additionally, they sent a missive to the governor, and using the
> Baháʾí petition and the freedom of the believers as an excuse, they raised
> the cry of “Our religion is lost!” All of this resulted in an unruly uproar;
> tumult reigned throughout Shíráz; and deplorable events were expected.

Meeting with the Qavámuʾl-Mulk

> On the evening of 4 Rabíʿuʾl-Avval [31 May 1903], the Qavámuʾl-Mulk
> sent word through his attendant, ʿAbbás Khán, a deeply devoted and
> enkindled Baháʾí youth and known as such to his master, the Qavám.
> That night, about one hour after dusk, ʿAbbás Khán came to the House
> of the Báb and informed Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán, “I bear the greetings
> and the best wishes of my master [the Qavámuʾl-Mulk]. He asked me to
> inform you, ‘Today at the Governorʾs Ark a common person280 submitted
> a petition to the governor in the name and over the signature of Baháʾís,
> requesting freedom [for the Baháʾí Faith]. The governor turned the matter
> over to me, and at your convenience, I wish to meet for an hour with
you at my residence in the city.’ ”

The Afnán replied to the message, “I am completely unfamiliar with
> this event and do not think Baháʾís would have sent such a petition or
> made such a request at a time when turmoil has engulfed the city. Per-

behalf, and you may disclose your wishes to him.”                            [p.440]

ʿAbbás Khán informed the Qavám, who designated the following eve-
> ning for this meeting, and we were informed of this appointment two
hours later by the same messenger.

The following evening, 5 Rabíʿuʾl-Avval [1 June 1903], about an hour
> after the sunset, this servant went to the speciﬁed address, an orchard
> belonging to the Qavám, and found him alone, pacing and waiting for
> me. I met ʿAbbás Khán, who took me to the Qavámuʾl-Mulk. After an
exchange of pleasantries and inquiring after my father’s health, he said:

“I am well acquainted with [your brother,] Áqá Mírzá Jalál Khán [who
> is the director of the post oﬃce in Ábádih], but I have never met you
before. Have you not been in Shíráz?”

> “No, I have not been here long.”
> “Where have you been?” he inquired.

“For nearly eleven years, I have been in foreign lands, living in working
as a merchant in Egypt and Port Said.”

> “Did you go to Syria?”282 he asked, and I answered aﬃrmatively.

“Did you attain the presence of Baháʾuʾlláh?” he further queried. I
answered positively.

> “Tell me about your journey to the presence of Baháʾuʾlláh,” he asked.

I remembered what the Blessed Beauty had spoken in Haifa about Yazd,
> and those utterances had been meant for this very evening and for the
> Qavám’s beneﬁt.283 Therefore, I began by telling him [of my journey to
> ʿAkká], “During Safar AH 1308 [September 1890], our family left Shíráz
> and arrived at Port Said where my father resided. My family then left
> that city on the 8 Dhiʾl-Hajjih [15 July 1891] and arrived at Haifa on
> the 10th of the same month. It was then summer, and the Blessed Perfec-
> tion was in Haifa. In that journey we remained for nine months in His
> presence, a portion in Haifa and the rest in ʿAkká. I remember distinctly
> that the Blessed Beauty was in Haifa when the news of events in Yazd
> arrived, to the eﬀect that Sultán Husayn Mírzá, the Jaláluʾd-Dawlih, the
> governor-general of Yazd, had martyred seven believers in the most grue-

During his ﬁnal months, Núriʾd-Dín was attacked in Shamshírgarhá Street, where
the House of the Báb was situated, and eventually passed away from these injuries.

> their highest. The details of this incident were reported in great detail to
> Baháʾuʾlláh. When this news was brought before Him, profound sorrow
> overcame the Blessed Perfection. For some time, whenever the friends
> would attain His sanctiﬁed presence, His utterances solely concerned the
> cruelties and brutalities of the Qájár against this much-wronged com-
> munity [Baháʾís]. I remember especially that one night my brothers and
> I were summoned into His presence, and for some two hours this bliss
lasted. The Tongue of Grandeur spoke thus:

> The Jaláluʾd-Dawlih has done what has caused the eyes of the denizens of
> the Supreme Concourse to shed tears of blood. Do you perceive the reason
> for his doings? The motive is that Masʿúd Mírzá, the Zilluʾs-Sultán, wrote Us
> a letter in his own handwriting, and gave it to Hájí Mírzá [Muhammad-]
> ʿAlí Sayyah to bring. Among the things he requested of Us was to aid him
> with the Bábís to destroy his Sháh-Bábá.284 “Should You do this,” he wrote,
> “I will give You liberty, I will give You authority, I will support You, I will
> make amends for past atrocities.” This Wronged-One wrote him, “Discard
[p.445]                such thoughts. Praying for the Sháh is obligatory for you, all Iranians, and

> Us. We do not desire liberty, nor rule. Were We after leadership, what
> authority could have been better than occupying the post of minister in
> Tihrán? For the sake of God, We have arisen to improve the morals of a
> number of people, wronged in this world. Never again write in this vein to
> Us. Never again put such requests to this Wronged-One.” Having despaired
> of such subversive imaginings, he has now arisen against the friends and
> harms them thus. But the tale of the wayward is not worth repeating. Ere
> long, however, he will become that “which he was a thing not worthy of
> remembrance.”285 You will see the name of the Qájár obliterated, and no
trace of them or their rule will remain.

Consider this: In one single city and at the same location, two persons
> dwell. One takes the path of waywardness, while the other acts with equity.
> One becomes the Mushír, and the other becomes the Qavám. From the
> dawn of the Cause in Shíráz, the Mushír has had the temerity to arise against
> the Faith. Ere long, that name will be eradicated from the realm of Fárs.
> In contrast, from the beginning of the Dispensation, the Qavám Dynasty

Qurʾán 76:1. The full verse is: “Did there not pass over man a [long] space of time
during which he was a thing not worthy of remembrance?”

A.Q. Afnán has recorded that when relating this story his father would add: And
> Baháʾuʾlláh further said, “The Qavámuʾl-Mulk has succored the captives and helped the

> I then related, “When Baháʾuʾlláh spoke these words, He also prayed for
you and asked for divine conﬁrmations on your behalf.”

On hearing this, Muhammad-Ridá Khán grew exceedingly happy and
with tremendous excitement, three times asked, “He prayed for us?”

“Yes, the One True God does not forget the deeds of anyone. God
> does not veil them. He conceals sins, but reveals our good and virtuous
doings.”

Afterwards, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk asked, “Are you aware of what has
> transpired in Isfahán and the tumult that rages in Shíráz? What sort of
> loutish person would send such a petition? And who would authorize
> such a deed? Now is not the time for such actions. I have exerted myself
> to prevent mischief over this and hope to be completely successful. I have
> always tried to vindicate the Baháʾís and provide every support. In the
> case of the Murtidá Sarvistání, I intensely tried to ensure the safety of that
> innocent youth. But in the incident of the crazed Siyyid [Fál-Asírí], I was
> not able to remedy the situation, and what transpired took place. Now
> you must admonish [the Baháʾís] to most stringently observe wisdom.
> It is best for the more prominent among them to remain at home for a
while until these troubles have dwindled.”

I responded, “Of a certainty, your will and counsel will be ﬁrmly adhered

> rabble from mischief-making. Surely, you have been informed that this

> and indeed the verse “And thou see the people enter God’s Religion in
troops,”287 has been realized there.

> “In America?” he inquired being most puzzled.

“Indeed, in America. I have a number of pictures of the American
believers.”

> “Through ʿAbbás Khán I will send them to your presence.”

“The sacred blood of believers was shed in Iran, and its eﬀect stands
> manifest in America. The Blessed Perfection told us, ‘Do not be sad over
> the martyrdom of believers in Iran. The sacred tree of the Cause of God
> is watered by the blood of the martyrs. A tree, unless watered, does not
grow and bear fruit.’ ”

In all, our discussions lasted some two hours. Afterward, I asked per-
mission to take my leave, and in bidding me farewell, he said, “Kindly
[p.450] convey my warmest greetings to your father. I was deeply pleased by

> meeting you tonight and thrilled to hear of the tidings spoken about us

sure to send the pictures of the American Baháʾís for me to see.”

When I arrived home, I briefed my father on what had been discussed
> and through ʿAbbás Khán sent the Qavám the pictures of the American
> believers that I had brought with me from the Holy Land.

Instigation of the ʿUlamá

> The day following, however, the residents of Shíráz began a massive
> altercation that included shutting all the shops in the bazaar for an
> extensive march, with accompanying shouted insults and curses through
> the streets, neighborhoods, and mosques.288 Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the
> Qavámuʾl-Mulk, and his eldest son, Habíbuʾlláh Khán, who at the time
> held the oﬃces of Kalántar and Bíglar-Baykí, and the [Qavám’s] younger

> the chieftains and strongly admonished them, “The administration will
> not tolerate mischief, and none among the vulgar and unruly citizens is
allowed to cause harm to the Baháʾís.”

Nevertheless, for three days the bazaars were closed and the ʿulamá
> and the rabble busy provoking malice and mischief. During this time,
> the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih, Muhammad-Ridá Khán Qavámuʾl-Mulk, Muham-
> mad-Husayn Mírzá Muʾayyaduʾs-Saltanih, Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán Amír-Panjih,

A.Q. Afnán has recorded the following additional details from his father (private
> communications, August 1997): “The clergy in Shíráz, following the example of the
> ʿulamá of Yazd, commenced mischief and disturbances against the Baháʾís of the city.
> Some shopkeepers, encouraged by Siyyid ʿAlí-Akbar Fál-Asírí, his son Siyyid Muhammad,
> Shaykh Muhsin Qannád, and Shaykh Jaʿfar Mahallátí, closed their businesses in protest.
> The clergy ascended the pulpits and began insulting the Faith and provoking the religious
> fervor of the multitudes until a complete uprising against the Cause and the massacre of
all Baháʾís seemed inevitable.”

He served as a high-ranking military oﬃcer.

> and Habíbuʾlláh Khán Bíglar-Baykí, were in private conference in the
> governor’s oﬃce about ways to restrain the rabble and bring peace to
> the city. They decided that it was best for several of the more prominent
> [Baháʾís] to remain at home and not to attend their shops in the bazaar.
> Mírzá Muhammad-Jaʿfar Khán, who numbered among the faithful, sin-
> cere believers and who was a private secretary to Habíbuʾlláh Khán [the
> Qavámuʾl-Mulk III], was instructed to inform these Baháʾís. A list of
> believers was prepared and included: this servant; my brother, Hájí Mírzá
> Buzurg; ʿAndalíb; Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim Sáʿat-Sáz [the watchmaker]; Mírzá
> Yúsuf Naqqásh [the painter]; Mírzá ʿAbduʾl-Husayn Naqqásh, known as
> Thábit [the steadfast]; Mírzá Jalál Zarqání; and Áqá ʿAlí-Akbar Khádim
[the attendant].

This list was brought by Mírzá Muhammad-Jaʿfar Khán to my father
> with the request, “In the course of our consultation, it was deemed
> advisable for these gentlemen to remain at home until the pandemonium
> and riots have alleviated.” The Afnán responded, “Please do as they have
> suggested.” Thereupon, Mírzá Muhammad-Jaʿfar Khán proceeded to the
> homes of the Baháʾís on the list and informed each of this decision by
> the governor and the Qavámuʾl-Mulk. Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim, Mírzá Yúsuf
> Naqqásh, and Mírzá ʿAbduʾl-Husayn Thábit each had a shop by the
> entrance to the Shrine of Siyyid Mír Ahmad Sháh-Chiráq and immedi-
> ately closed their shops and remained at home. Áqá Mírzá Jalál, who was

> remained home. My brothers, Hájí Mírzá Buzurg and Hájí Mírzá Díyá’,
and I remained secluded at the Blessed House of the Báb.

The ﬁfth day of demonstrations was a Thursday [4 June 1903], and it
> was noised throughout the city that the celebrated ʿulamá had issued a

> the other ʿulamá receive a sum of money as a prize for the cessation of

Intervention of the Imám-Jumʿih

> Finding this suggestion agreeable, the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih asked Hájí Shaykh
> Yahyá, the Imám-Jumʿih, to be brought to his oﬃce. The latter was a
> particularly virtuous and well-intending person, always supporting the
> believers and the Cause, and never perpetrating harm or disrespect. Upon
> his arrival, the governor and the Qavámuʾl-Mulk briefed him on their
> predicament and asked his assistance in alleviating the troubles and com-
> motion. The Imám-Jumʿih promised that on the following day, [Friday,]
> he would admonish the citizens, calm the situation, and ensure that by
> Saturday all the shops were opened and the tumult subsided. They also
> decided to send a sum of money to the inﬂuential ﬁgures291 in order to
persuade them to cooperate.292

Friday morning, the public criers of the Imám-Jumʿih proclaimed
> throughout the city that four hours before dusk all citizens of every rank
> were to gather at the Masjid Vakíl in order to hear his sermon. People
> thought that this was the awaited hour when the Imám intended to
> announce his fatwá [against the Baháʾís].293 This news quickly circled
> through the city.

Presumably, a reference to the ʿulamá.

Based on his father’s recollections, Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán notes, “The Imám-Jumʿih had
> suggested that the best course of action was for the governor to donate a sum of money
> to the ʿulamá. Being in agreement with this proposal, the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih invited some
> prominent Baháʾís in order to confer with them and acquaint them with the situation.
> Those attending the gathering contributed a sum that totaled nearly one thousand tumáns,
> the majority of which was contributed by the head of the telegraph oﬃce, Muhammad-
> Husayn Mírzá, the Muʾayyaduʾs-Saltanih. When the money was ready, depending on
> the rank and inﬂuence of each cleric involved in the uproar, the Imám-Jumʿih allocated
> a portion to each. He asked the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih to write a letter to each cleric stating,
> ‘Since a surplus is available from the tax account and now needs to be distributed to the
> poor and needy, I am leaving it in your charge to disburse it in any way that you deem
> appropriate.’ The Imám-Jumʿih further emphasized that the governor should ensure that
> his attendants collected a receipt upon the delivery of the sum” (private communication,
August 1997).

Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh added parenthetically, “The Imám-Jumʿih was peerless in elo-
> quence, and all the inhabitants, young and old, male or female alike, would listen to him
> attentively and with due consideration.”

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 166                                                                                   7/10/2008 3:45:30 PM

By the appointed hour, the entire courtyard, the cloisters, the roofs,
> and even the minarets of the mosque were thronged with onlookers,
> and the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk and other oﬃcials were in
> attendance as well. The Imám-Jumʿih, being more than eighty years of
> age and rather frail, arrived carried on the shoulders of his servant. On
> beholding him, in unison the crowd raised its voice in greeting. People
> were giving the glad tidings to each other that the Imám was about to
> issue his ruling and conclude the aﬀair.294 He ascended the pulpit and
> delivered an eloquent homily. Thereafter, he began his sermon, ﬂavored
> with his customary sweet stories and humorous anecdotes that only he
> could deliver. Having completely won over the attention of his audience,
in his most gentle tone he addressed the city’s inhabitants:

> O ye people! You are all well aware that I stand eighty years of age and
> that I associate with all the residents of this town and know each and every
> person from every corner and class. You also recognize that you all are truly
> like my own brothers and children. I will not permit, and surely you will
> not consent either, that certain malefactors accuse you, or some of you, in
> various ways and issue slanders about you. Recall to mind that the Apostle
> of God, Muhammad ibn ʿAbduʾlláh, peace be upon Him, has admonished
> His sacred community in the Qurʾán, “Say not to anyone who oﬀers you
> a salutation: ‘Thou art none of a believer!’ ”295 Moreover, the Immaculate
> Imám [ʿAlí] has stated, “We are to consider the evident aspect of things.”296
> Therefore, according to the text of the Sacred Qurʾán and the Tradition of
> the Holy Imám, we are forbidden from pronouncing others as unbelievers
or labeling them non-Muslim.

Having established this, I now ask you to repeat after me, and I promise [p.460]
> you that if you were to do so, the everlasting paradise would be yours. Shout
> out three times, “In Shíráz, God willing, there are no Bábís!” By my life,

> After he had extracted this declaration from the people, he said, “Today
> is Friday, and it is a good hour. Let us all go to the bazaar and open
> our shops. And from tomorrow, Saturday, everyone must commence his
> business.”297

That is, the people were expecting that Imám’s ruling would unleash a Baháʾí genocide.

A.Q. Afnán (private communications, August 1996) has noted that his father used
> to add the following said by the Imám, “Tonight, on everyone’s behalf, I will perform
> the Hájjat prayer and beseech the Apostle of God to intercede on our behalf on the Day
> of Resurrection and to shower our businesses with His conﬁrmations.” Thereupon, the
> Imám emptied a handkerchief ﬁlled with sugarplums over the heads of the audience and
> told them to sweeten their mouths.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 167                                                                                     7/10/2008 3:45:30 PM

It was two hours until sunset when people left the mosque and happily
proceeded to open all shops and begin their commerce.

A number of Baháʾís, who were not known as such, had been attending the
> sermon at the Masjid [Vakíl] and at once came to the Blessed House of the
> Báb to inform us that the Imám-Jumʿih had wisely alleviated the disturbance
and had calmed the storm. May God exalt his station in the Great Beyond.

The following day, Saturday, all the merchants and the shopkeepers
> resumed their business, and it seemed as if none of these events had ever

That evening, the Imám-Jumʿih instructed one of his conﬁdants, a most

Qásim] with suﬃcient funds.

A.Q. Afnán notes based on his father’s recollections: “Other Baháʾís who had shops
in area of Sháh-Chiráq were also recipients of the Imám-Jumʿih’s immense beneﬁcence.”

CHAPTER FOURTEEN

RESTORATION OF THE HOUSE OF THE BÁB

The Second Restoration of the Blessed House in AH 1321 [1903]

[p.465:1] From the beginning of the month of Rabíʿuʾth-Thání [27 June 1903],

> every time the post arrived, it brought a Tablet [from ʿAbduʾl-Bahá regard-
> ing the restoration of the House of the Báb] in honor of the Afnán. In
> the ﬁrst Tablet, it was instructed that an estimate of the total cost of the
> repairs be prepared and sent [to the Holy Land]. Through the aid of the
> Miʿmár-Báshí [the construction taskmaster], the Afnán prepared a detailed
> estimate of the costs of construction and a drawing of the Sacred House,
> and sent it to ʿAbduʾl-Bahá. Upon its receipt, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá revealed several
> sanctiﬁed Tablets insisting on immediate commencement of the restoration
> work of the House. In response, the Afnán began to make the required
plans and to assemble the necessary provisions.

At the beginning of Jamádíyuʾl-Avval [26 July 1903], the post from
> the Holy Land brought an exalted Tablet for Áqá Mírzá Áqá Núriʾd-
> Dín, the Afnán, as the custodian of the House of God. Therein, special
> emphasis and utmost weight were placed on restoring the Blessed House
> to its exact original form [at the time of the Báb].302 That blessed Text is
> included below so that the divine friends would become aware of God’s
inscrutable wisdom in this regard:

> Shíráz. The illustrious Afnán of the sacred Lote-Tree, the honored Áqá Mírzá
Áqá, upon him rest the Glory of God, the Most Glorious.

He is God.

> O thou august oﬀshoot of the sacred Lote-Tree! Some time ago, thou

> the celestial Kaʿbih, and a response was sent to thee. However, news of its
receipt hath not arrived.

The restoration of the Blessed House [of the Báb] is thy most immediate

In 1872–73, at the request of Khadíjih Bagum and with Baháʾuʾlláh’s consent, the
design of the House was altered under the supervision of Núriʾd-Dín.

> me to invite several of the more experienced believers to the Blessed
> House to ponder these divine injunctions and consult on ways for the
> construction work to commence. This servant invited the following nine
> believers: my maternal uncle, Áqá Siyyid Husayn Afnán; ʿAndalíb; the
> Prince Muhammad-Husayn Mírzá, the Muʾayyaduʾs-Saltanih; Áqá Jaʿfar-
> Qulí Khán Amír-Panjih [the regiment commander]; Colonel Ahmad-Qulí
> Khán; Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí-Muhammad Khán, the Muvaqqariʾd-Dawlih; the
> Prince Muhib-ʿAlí Mírzá; Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán; and Mírzá
Áqá Miʿmár-Báshí.

As the Afnán had instructed, the named personages assembled in
> the Blessed House and read the received Tablets. After tea and sherbet
> were served, consultation commenced, and each person presented his
> views, spoke in a diﬀerent manner, and commented as he wished. The
> Muvaqqariʾd-Dawlih stated, “This undertaking is untimely, as the troubles
> in Isfahán and Yazd have not subsided and the blood of the martyrs is
> still fresh on the soil of Yazd.” Áqá Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán added, “The episode
> of Isfahán and the [Russian] Consulate building is still current among
> people, and it is likely that the reconstruction of the Blessed House would
> likewise precipitate turmoil in Shíráz.” Others articulated similar views
and supported the same sentiments.

The Prince Muʾayyaduʾs-Saltanih, however, commented, “In this
> regard, we must ﬁrst ascertain the views of the Afnán.” Collectively, they
> asked him for his opinion, and the Afnán stated, “I submit to you that
> ijtihád [religious deduction] in the presence of an explicit text is wrong.
> [ʿAbduʾl-Bahá] has written, ‘A moment’s hesitation is not permitted.’ He
> is the Head of the Faith and the all-encompassing fashioner of events.
> He knows best when to build and when to destroy. No need for us to
> express views or to put forth an opinion when His command is made
> known and stands manifest. He has written, ‘Of a certainty, commence
> this task, and do not wait for funds, as they will arrive.’305 Therefore, my
> vote is to act consonant with His instructions since we are servants and
> He is the Master. Servants’ views are unimportant when the Master has
spoken.”

The Prince [Muʾayyaduʾs-Saltanih] exclaimed his praise and said, “I am

The Start of Construction

> On the appointed day, the honored Miʿmár-Báshí together with his crew

in the Blessed House with various tasks.

Within two months, the main structure of the House was raised in the

Both the overall layout and the details were in exact conformity with

The following Tablet speaks to the need to maintain the original design of the House
of the Báb (INBMC 52:360–61, no. 406):

> Shíráz. The illustrious Afnán of the sacred Lote-Tree, the honored Áqá Mírzá Buzurg

Áqá, upon him rest the Glory of God, the Most Glorious.

He is God!
O thou exalted oﬀshoot of the divine Tree! What thou didst write was

> His attendant—a man bent on malice and enmity—noised abroad among
> the people, “The chief of the Bábís, who lives in the Shamshírgarhá street,
> is ill, and my master, who is his physician, has said he will expire any

> started trouble and insults. We also heard reports from various directions
> that the shopkeepers in the nearby bazaar were saying, “At the time of
Áqá Mírzá Áqá’s death we must not remain passive.”

This servant therefore concluded that our foes were making plans to
> uproot us, and as such I informed both the Prince Muʾayyad [uʾs-Saltanih]
> and Áqá Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán.308 The latter assigned several of his esteemed
> men, who were also Baháʾís, to quietly come and spend the nights in the
> residence adjacent to the House of the Báb. Moreover, the Muʾayyaduʾs-
> Saltanih informed Habíbuʾlláh Khán Bíglar-Baykí, “Áqá Mírzá Áqá is ill
> and is likely to pass away soon. The rabble is scheming to cause mischief
> and diﬃculties. As the city’s Kalántar, you must certainly prevent these
lewd elements from achieving their wicked purpose.”

On hearing this, Habíbuʾlláh Khán sent word to me through Mírzá
> Muhammad-Jaʿfar Khán, “Whatever is your wish, I stand ready to
> assist. The local Kad-Khudá and chieftain have been told, when needed
> and you are ready, to aid in the beﬁtting transfer of the corpse to the
> cemetery.” Noting his cooperation and cordiality, this servant expressed
> gratitude and continued to manage aﬀairs. Several devoted and dutiful [p.480]
> believers were selected to help during this period. They were: Áqá Mírzá
> Muhammad-Jaʿfar Khán; Mírzá ʿAlí-Muhammad Khán; Mírzá Lutfuʾlláh
> Khán, the Khádim-Báshí; Mírzá ʿAlí-Ridá Khán; Mírzá Asaduʾlláh Khán

and ready for service.

Through our consultations it was determined that it would be best not

necessary provisions for a memorial service were sent there.

With humility, submissiveness, and while uttering the Holy Verses, on
> Monday, 26 Shaʿbán AH 1321 [17 November 1903], the spirit of that
> essence of being [Núriʾd-Dín] ascended to the Exalted Horizon and Abhá

with joy and ecstasy.

The appointed friends gathered to assist with the burial arrangements.

> Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Jaʿfar Khán, who was assigned by Áqá Habíbuʾlláh
> Bíglar-Baykí, instructed several of the farrashes of the latter to guard the

> ritual ablutions and the performance of other rites in accordance with
> Baháʾí percepts.309 That night, his remains were interred by the entrance

> brothers and all the friends we returned to the Blessed House and spent
the night in mourning.

In the morning, a number of divine friends joined us in the House so

Baháʾí rituals for preparation of the dead and burial are provided by Baháʾuʾlláh in
the Kitáb-i Aqdas.

restoration of the house of the báb              177

The believers began to clean the House when, in accordance to their
> everyday practice, all the laborers, carpenters, and other workers arrived
> and on hearing what had transpired, although they were not Baháʾís,
> most selﬂessly began to help to clean the House. Within two hours the
> entire Blessed House was cleared of all the construction materials and was
> completely furnished. In addition, tea, coﬀee, sherbet, and other refresh-
ments were ready for the visitors.

As was customary, the Muʿarrif-Báshí invited the Qurʾán reciters, who
> arrived and began chanting Sacred Verses. For three days, the believers
> and other friends from all strata of the community would visit and share
in the prayer vigils.

It was customary that on such occasions an important person would
> come on the third day and conclude the prayer gathering. As such, on [p.485]
> the ﬁnal day, in company of a number of ministers and farrashes, Áqá
> Mírzá Ibráhím Khán, the eldest son of the Áqá Habíbuʾlláh Khán, the
> Qavámuʾl-Mulk [IV], arrived and ceremoniously concluded the com-
> memorative prayer vigils. The fact that such dignitaries came for this
purpose left many of the nonbelievers wonder-struck.

This third day of the memorial meeting coincided with the 28 Shaʿbán
> [19 November 1903], which was the anniversary of the martyrdom of
> His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb], and the sound of mourning and
> lamentation was raised high from the Blessed House and the adjacent
homes.

Much wisdom was concealed and enshrined in the way that this
> memorial service unfolded, and it only gradually became apparent. For
> instance, previously the non-Baháʾís had all manner of thoughts about
> the reconstruction of the Blessed House and had allowed their imagina-
> tions to run wild in this regard. They had wondered what construction
> was taking place in such small dwelling and what purpose it was to serve.
> However, when they came [for the services], they saw that their previous
> notions were wrong and that their imaginations had led them astray, and
> realized that it was only a simple House. The other misconception was
> that they never thought we would be in a position to associate with the
> most prominent and inﬂuential citizens of the community, including
many among the wealthy and the merchants.

Through this incident, they grew cognizant of the majesty of the Cause

The period of the Afnán’s illness until his passing was about forty-
> ﬁve days. After the conclusion of the memorial services, the news of his
> death and a list of all those who had served during this ordeal were sent
> to the presence of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá. After a month, a number of Tablets
> were revealed as a bounty on the friends as well as a Visitation Tablet in

never dissipate.”

Completion of the Restoration

> Subsequent to the passing of the Afnán, this servant and my brother,
> Áqá Hájí Mírzá Buzurg, continued to send monthly, nay, weekly detailed
> progress reports on the restoration of the Blessed House of the Báb to
> ʿAbduʾl-Bahá.312 In turn, the sacred pen of the Center of the Covenant
> revealed many Tablets during this period in honor of these ephemeral
servants.

From the beginning of construction to the end, it took almost two
> years and a few months, and throughout this period the work advanced
> methodically. The divine friends in Fárs and other parts of Iran donated
> towards the expenses of the restoration; a list of contributors was regularly
submitted to the presence of the Master; and receipts issued therefrom.

When all the work was completed, there was a shortfall of ﬁve hundred
> tumáns, which at that time was nearly impossible to raise. However, the
> venerable Muhammad-Husayn Mírzá, the Muʾayyad [u’s-Saltanih], donated
> this remaining sum. After the completion of work and the ﬁnal tally of
> expenditures, a report was presented to the Holy Land, and the following
> Tablet was received, reﬂecting ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s joy and happiness:

Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán notes: “In his will, among his children, Núriʾd-Dín had chosen
> my father, Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh, as the next custodian of the House of the Báb. From that
> moment, a profoundly important responsibility was placed on my father’s shoulders. In
> the discharge of his duties and for the rest of his days, he knew not a moment’s rest by
> night, nor tranquility in the day. In addition to his great responsibility as the custodian
> of the House, he also had to safeguard the enormous collection of holy relics, Tablets,
> and manuscripts left in his trust. Although in truth these were all personal possessions,
> yet he deeply believed that all he owned belonged to the Cause in the ﬁrst place” (private
> communication, December 1995). In a Tablet (INBMC 52:339, no. 381) addressed to
> Núriʾd-Dín’s ﬁve children, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá informs them that a copy of the deceased’s will

Muʾayyad is truly conﬁrmed, triumphant, successful, and luminous.

Praised be God, and thanks be unto Him for what hath transpired.

The news of the illness of the mother of Áqá Mírzá Baháʾuʾd-Dín brought
> sadness and much sorrow, and I prayed for her forgiveness at His Threshold of

This turn of events further testiﬁes to the purity of her intentions.

> Praise and salutations be upon you.

It is important to record in these pages of history the text of ʿAbduʾl-

at the Master’s bidding, to further adorn these pages:

Buzurg, upon him rest the Glory of God.

> succeeded in this undertaking. Complete the account ledger in an orderly

honored Miʿmár-Báshí will assuredly be of the utmost aid.

CHAPTER FIFTEEN

POLITICAL TURMOIL AND CONSTITUTIONAL REVOLT

> As the demise of Qájár rule drew near, each day witnessed a new dis- [p.501:1]
> turbance or commotion in the nation as a whole, and the occurrences
> of many incidents, especially in the province of Fárs. Every year brought
> a new cycle of upheaval, with each lasting some three to four months.
> The ﬁrst step in instigating troubles was to encourage the vulgar and the
> mob elements to compose the most unseemly verses against this party
> [i.e., Baháʾís] and to chant these in their street marches, giving vent to
> all manner of insults and slanders against this people. Rank upon rank
> of rogues, led ﬁrst by the youths and followed by the adults, all carrying
> pistols, riﬂes, swords, and clubs, would shut the bazaar and congregate
> in the mosques and shrines demanding the dismissal of the governor.
> They would advance the charge, “The governor is a Bábí, and we refuse
> a Bábí governor!” Through the most horriﬁc deeds, they would eﬀect the
> dismissal of the governor [and other authorities]. And since the central
> government had grown particularly weak and ineﬀectual, it was unable
> to rule and prevent the mob from such disturbances.

Community Inﬁltration by Dervish ʿAlí

> During this time, an insidious character by the name of Dervish ʿAlí
> became acquainted with some gullible Baháʾís and expressed a deep desire
> to learn about the Faith. In response, some of the friends began to teach
> him, and for a while he associated with the believers working in the
> bazaar. Through these contacts he learned many Baháʾí expressions and
> teachings, including the identity of the early believers, the martyrs, and
> the Letters of the Living of the ﬁrst Era, and knew the membership of
the entire Baháʾí community of Shíráz, young and old alike.

Once he had collected suﬃcient intelligence, [he showed his true
> colors and] quietly began to whisper critically about the Faith. Certain
> non-Baháʾís capitalized on the situation and, realizing that he was a useful
> instrument in their designs for turmoil, further encouraged him during
> periods of disturbance. This unprincipled man, however, worked both
> sides of the fence. That is, while he was aligned with the troublemakers,

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 183                                                                    7/10/2008 3:45:32 PM

> he continued his association with many Baháʾí shopkeepers of the bazaar
> who would secretly show him every consideration and pay him ransom in
> order for him not to divulge their identity publicly. This, as it turned out,
> only further incited him in his ways, and in fact he made it his business
[to blackmail the friends].

Throughout the year, summer and winter alike, carrying a club, he
> would walk the streets each day: the mornings among the shops, the
> middays at the mosque and shrines, and the afternoons in the streets
> and marketplaces. Thus he would grossly insult and vilify the Cause. He
> would start by calling out the names of the Holy Figures in the most
> indecorous language, and add to it insults and abuse on the Letters of
> the Living and the martyrs of the Cause—all in the most unseemly
> language and fashion. He would continue in this manner crying out
> the names of contemporary Baháʾís, and each name was accompanied
> by a most indecent characterization or designation. [For instance,] Áqá
> Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq Khabbáz [baker] was called “ ʿUmar”; Áqá ʿAlí-
> Akbar Khádim was “the angel of death”; the Afnán was “Chihl-Chiráq”
> [forty-light]; this servant was “Imám Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín”; Mírzá ʿAbduʾl-
> Husayn Thábit was “the Satan”; Mírzá Abúʾl-Hasan Darvázih-Bán [the
> gatekeeper] was “the devil”; and with such labels he would identify these
> personages. The canaille and the ragtag elements would circle round this
> mongrel, pay him money, and provoke, encourage, and goad him in
> this contemptible behavior. In such wise he would publicly identify the
friends.

For instance, he would come by the Sháh-Chiráq market and stand
[p.505] before the haberdasher shop of four exceptionally devoted, enkindled

> believers and abuse them by name, saying: “Upon the four candles of
> the Bábí society, Mírzá Abúʾl-Hasan, Mírzá Muhammad-Ridá, Mírzá ʿAlí,
> and Mírzá Muhammad, be a hundred thousand curses every instant!” The
> rabble that circled round this unscrupulous villain would then join in,
and they would in unison curse the believers.

He would then proceed a bit further and cry out, “Curses be upon the
> thrice ill-fated, Mashhadí Khusraw, Mashhadí Nazr, and Mashhadí Saﬁr
Kuláh-Mál Sarvistání in Gud-i ʿArabán!”

The cloister [of the Shrine] of Siyyid Mír Ahmad Sháh-Chiráq witnessed
> considerable public traﬃc, where scores of people would congregate and
> where many believers had their shops and bread-winning stores. Dervish
> ʿAlí would amass an even larger gathering there and stand for two hours
> naming all the Baháʾís one-by-one.

political turmoil and constitutional revolt                185

I especially recall that one day I was in the shop of the late Mírzá
> Abúʾl-Qásim Sáʿat-Sáz [watch-repairer], where believers would gather
> most days and meet one another. That dreadful man entered the cloister
> through the bazaar gate and ﬁrst named the blessed name and title of
> His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb]. Then he named the Blessed
> Perfection with His titles. And afterwards, Mullá Husayn Bushrúʾí, the
> Letters of the Living, the illustrious Quratuʾl-ʿAyn [Táhirih], the martyrs
> of the Cause, until at the end he came to the believers of the present
> age, mentioning each [Baháʾí] haberdasher, hat-maker, including Hájí
> Muhammad-Husayn Bazzáz who was a merchant at that time. At that
> time, Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim said to me, “Be attentive as your turn will be
> soon.” Dervish ʿAlí then named my late father, the Afnán, by saying, “A
> hundred thousand curses be upon the forty-lights of the Bábís’ grand-
> priest, Hájí Mírzá Áqá Afnán, and his four oﬀspring, Mírzá Jalál, Mírzá
> Buzurg, Mírzá Habíb, and Mírzá Díyá’, who live in the Shamshírgarhá
Street and serve the Kaʿbih of the Bábís!”

In reality, his introduction of the believers in this way served to let the
> seekers know that these men could provide information on the Faith and
could aid in investigating the truth.

For four years it was thus, and this scoundrel in collusion with other
> base and vulgar elements would constantly heap insults on the gentle
> friends. Several times, Habíbuʾlláh Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk [IV], who
> at that time discharged the oﬃces of Kalántar and Biglar-Baykí of Shíráz,
> banished that perpetrator of wrong [Dervish ʿAlí] as a means of main-
> taining the city’s order, preventing public commotion, and protecting the
> believers from the barrage of insults. Being exiled from the city, he would
> however continue unhindered in the surrounding towns and villages, and
> soon would reappear in Shíráz. He also had taught his ill-reputed twelve-
> year-old son to behave in exactly the same way as he himself did in all
the markets and streets.

At the appointed time though, the ocean of divine wrath billowed forth,
> and this man contracted heinous diseases, such as melancholy and black
> leprosy. With a thoroughly disﬁgured face and mouth, he lived home-
> less in the streets, and all would ﬂee on seeing his diseased person. Even
> among the foes and the nonbelievers, he became an example of divine
> chastisement. In the utmost misery and anguish he left this nether world
> and was condemned to eternal condemnation. “Take heed, O men of
> understanding.” It was never known what happened to his ill-mannered
> son after Dervish ʿAlí’s death.

The Second Governorship of the Shuʿáʿuʾs-Saltanih

As noted earlier, because of the perpetual turmoil and disturbances, none
[p.510] of the citizens, especially the Baháʾís, had a moment’s peace. At nights, the

> roar of guns and riﬂes, and in daytime, the fury of the riﬀraﬀ ’s protests and
> uproar of the ragtag and thugs continued. Most shops and marketplaces
> were closed in fear of the rabble’s attacks and plunder. The ʿulamá were
> growing weary of the situation and indeed even sensed personal threats.
> They repeatedly cabled [the authorities in] Tihrán and succeeded in win-
> ing the immediate dismissal of Mírzá Ahmad Khán, the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih.
> The latter left during the night, and aﬀairs were placed in the hands of
> Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk [III]. With this news, tran-
quility returned to the city, and all the shops opened for business.

A second telegram [from Tihrán] in AH 1322 [1904] announced the
> appointment of the Prince Malik Mansúr Mírzá, the Shuʿáʿuʾs-Saltanih,
> to the oﬃce of governor-general, and he installed Muhammad-Husayn
> Mírzá, the Muʾayyaduʾs-Saltanih,315 as his deputy-governor and in charge
> of the city. The Prince arrived after one or two months, and for a year
> thereafter the city was calm and orderly; and no one breathed any dis-
> content, all working harmoniously with one another and none uttering
an insult against the Cause.

However, Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk, still harbored
> deep resentments from the governor’s ﬁrst tenure, the support that the
> latter had received from the Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís, and the uproars that were
> triggered as result of the telegraph oﬃce incident. As such, he constantly
> sought an opportunity to instigate troubles leading to the governor’s demise
> and exit from the city. Secretly, he met with the ʿulamá and created favor-
> able conditions for the renewal of turmoil and agitation.

Public Disturbances

> The ﬁrst step was taken when Áqá Mírzá Ibráhím Mahallátí, one of the
> foremost ʿulamá, stated in his seminary classes, “From what I have heard,
> the home of [Mullá] Mayvar, the Jew, has a taller wall than the home of
> the Muslims. This is against our religious law and is strictly forbidden.

His wall must be torn down.” Since they had already assembled all the

This Qájár Prince was the powerful head of the telegraph oﬃce and a steadfast
Baháʾí.

> necessary provisions for a disturbance and altercation, upon this pro-
> nouncement, the rabble raised the cry of “Yá ʿAlí!” and “Haydar, haydar!”
> to the pinnacle of the heavens, and began to march in the streets and the
> bazaar. All the shops and the markets were shut. Led by wanton women
> and youngsters, the populace, thugs, and ruﬃans rushed to that Jewish
> home, and thoroughly destroyed it and plundered all its possessions. The
> governor tried to prevent further public disturbances, but it only fueled
> the fury. That very night, the opposition fortiﬁed all the strategic build-
ings and placed gunmen on the elevations.

When the governor learned that the people, provoked by the ʿulamá,
> had arisen to perpetrate mischief and were about to attack the Jewish
> quarter and murder and plunder the inhabitants of that district,316 he
> summoned Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán,317 the Amír-Panjih [Major General] of the
> Farydaní forces, and instructed him to protect the Jewish homes. Imme-
> diately, Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán, the Muʿazziamuʾl-Mulk, arrayed his soldiers,
> assigned them to various posts in that quarter, and placed armed guards
on the rooftops of the Jewish homes.

Led by the ʿulamá, the mob congregated next morning in the Masjid
> Naw and Sháh-Chiráq, which were joined together. In unison, they raised
> the chant, “The Prince is Bábí, and his administration is entirely Bábí!
> We refuse a Bábí governor!” And in like manner, they began the most
> indecorous and degrading chants against the Faith and everything associ-
> ated with this wronged party. The word Bábí and unseemly insults were
> the currency of the day. Climbing to the Masjid’s roof, they were crying
> a series of repulsive and abhorrent verses that actually made no sense
whatsoever, yet each verse contained an insult to “the Bábí Prince.”

Soon, the congregation—akhúnds, siyyids, dervishes, thugs, and rabble

The House of the Báb was also located in that quarter.

A staunch Baháʾí.

The commotion in the Masjid continued for three days, and on the
> third day, when the throng of the ʿulamá, merchants, shopkeepers, and
> the populace were assembled, the divines ordered the assault on the [Jew-
> ish] quarter and the murder of its inhabitants. The thugs and youngsters
> began to charge from the rooftops, and a large number took to the streets
and rushed in that direction.

Jaʿfar-Quli Khán, who was commissioned to protect and safeguard the
> Jewish neighborhood, had his troops positioned in the quarter. He and
> some of his men were resting and smoking water-pipes on the rooftop
> of the residence of Mullá Rabíʿ, one of the Jewish merchants. From this
> vantage-point, he readily saw the mob advancing on the quarter with
> great haste. He took out of his pocket a copy of the Qurʾán and handed
> it to his special attendant, Mírzá Husayn—one of the most devoted and
> enkindled Baháʾís—with the instruction, “With great urgency, reach these
> ignorant people and tell them on my behalf, ‘I am tasked to safeguard
> this quarter, and I have sworn on these Words of God that I shall carry
> out my charge and repulse your assault. Therefore, halt your attack and
do not cause diﬃculties for either of us.”

Mírzá Husayn quickly reached the Masjid and came before the dis-
> tinguished ʿulamá conveying the message of the Amír-Panjih only to
> see his warning completely ignored. Returning at once, Mírzá Husayn
> informed his commander of the determination of the ʿulamá to proceed
> with their aggression, and in turn, Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán, the Amír-Panjih,
> concluded that once the quarter came under an assault and pillage, then
> the Blessed House of the Báb would surely be destroyed as well. There-
> fore, as the throng of the ignorant mob left the Masjid over the rooftops,
> destined for the [Jewish] quarter, the Amír-Panjih ordered the trumpets
> sounded, summoned his men, distributed live ammunition to his soldiers,
> armed himself with a pistol, and stood ready for battle against the
mob.

Meanwhile, a number of the friends had joined me in the Blessed
> House, and these included: Mírzá Lutfuʾlláh, the Khádim-Báshí [the
> governor’s attendant]; Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq Khabbáz [the baker];
> Mírzá Shukruʾlláh Jahrúmí; Mírzá ʿAlí-Muhammad Khán; and my broth-
> ers, Hájí Mírzá Buzurg and Hájí Mírzá Díyá’. One can well imagine the
> condition that we were in and the uncertainty that governed. Resigned
> to the Will of God and yearning for His conﬁrmations, we were busy
> praying fervently and supplicating, and waiting to see what the Almighty
> had decreed for us.

political turmoil and constitutional revolt                               189

By then, several of the malcontent and the rabble had reached the
> roof of the Blessed House, stoning everything below. They were ready to
> descend to the courtyard and enter the House when Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán,
> the Amír-Panjih, who was nearby, learned of their position and ordered

Departure of Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís from Shíráz

Based on his father’s recollections, A.Q. Afnán notes (private communication,
August 1997):

> The ʿulamá’s other excuse for uproar and revolt was the presence of Abúʾl-Hasan
> Mírzá, the Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís, who had lived in Shíráz with inﬂuence and respect for
> well nigh ﬁfteen years and who was involved in ecclesiastical matters and delivered
> ﬁery sermons. During this time, his Baháʾí identity had been discovered, and because
> of his close association with the Shuʿáʿuʾs-Saltanih and his direct involvement in
> governmental aﬀairs, they noised abroad, “The Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís has converted the
> Shuʿáʿuʾs-Saltanih and his men to the Bábí Faith.” This tumult was so potent that it
> forced the Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís to leave the city in the middle of the night for Isfahán,
> leaving his wife and family in care of Shaykh Muhammad-Taqí Zulqadr Fasáʾí who
> was to send them at a later date. Shaykh Muhammad-Taqí, who was a Baháʾí and a
> close companion of the Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís, delivered his family to their destination, and
with much diﬃculty procured a house for them in Isfahán and saw to their comfort.

Meanwhile, the Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís sent a telegram to the Prince Muʾayyaduʾs-Saltanih
> and asked him also to rent a dwelling for him. The Muʾayyaduʾs-Saltanih rented two
> residences belonging to Áqá Muhammad-Javád Sarráf and placed these in the Shaykh’s
> disposal. About this time [the governor of Isfahán], the Zilluʾs-Sultán, left for a hunt-
> ing expedition. However, this was merely an excuse for not receiving Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís,
> and he also asked the ecclesiastics not to visit him so that through this inattention
> haply the refugee would leave the city. To combat this, Mírzá Asaduʾlláh Khán
> Vazír, Áqá Muhammad Sarráf, and a few other Baháʾís prepared a tent and a pulpit
> for Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís to deliver sermons, as he was renowned for his eloquence and
deductive style. After a few months, however, he left in favor of residence in Tihrán.

During the entire course of the upheaval in Shíráz, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk plotted
ways to overthrow the Shuʿáʿuʾs-Saltanih.

> night-season the roar of gunﬁre and a barrage of bullets kept everyone
frightened to their core.

Eventually, after three months, a telegram was received from Tihrán,
[p.520] dismissing Prince Shuʿáʿuʾs-Saltanih from oﬃce and summoning him to

> the capital. The central authorities in Tihrán asked that until the appoint-
> ment of a new governor, Habíbuʾlláh Khán Bíglar-Baykí, the eldest son of
Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk [III], establish order.

With the Prince’s departure, the marketplaces and shops opened, but

The Tenure of ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih

Shíráz on Shaʿbán AH 1323 [October 1905].319

For instance, he ordered a band to play music by the old Maydán
> Túpkhánih, which currently is known as the Pahlaví Circle or Bágh Millí
> [the National Garden]. Several cafés and teahouses were established in
> that place, and the concourse of citizens were encouraged to frequent the
> area, partake of the festivities, and make merry. He himself would walk
> among them in civilian garb and observe their behavior and disposition.
> Whenever anyone oﬀended another or behaved iniquitously, that person
was summarily arrested and dealt with accordingly.

On one occasion, I was present in the Maydán when an akhúnd rep-
> resenting Mírzá Ibráhím Mahallátí came before the illustrious governor
> [the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih]. He stated, “Áqá Hujjatuʾl-Islám has asked me to
> convey, ‘Since a number of worshipers and I are engaged in oﬀering our
> obligatory prayers in the [nearby] Masjid Vakíl, the sound of music disturbs
> our concentration. It would be good if you could order the music stopped
> during the intervals when the worshipers are praying.’ ” Upon hearing this
> comment, the governor pulled the akhúnd forward and slapped him hard,
> saying, “To hell with Áqá for making this request! You go tell that akhúnd,
> ‘You keep busy with your duty, and do not interfere with the aﬀairs of the
> state and the authorities. You say your prayers, and we play our music!’ ”
> He added to this several of his choicest curses and sent those as a gift for
> the Áqá! He then ordered two more bands to join on the opposite sides
of the Maydán and to play music as loud as they could!

In short, for a year and a half, he ruled very eﬀectively and prevented
> the ill-intentioned mischief-makers from instigating trouble. However,
> since the Qájár’s reign was coming to an end and from other regions revo-
> lutionary sentiments and general discontent were spilling over to Shíráz,
> the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih realized that his eﬀorts would soon be neutralized and
> that agitators would prepare the means of upheaval. Therefore, he cabled
> his resignation from the governorship of Fárs and proceeded to Tihrán.

The Rule of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk, AH 1324

> That year passed amiably. During that period, Muhammad-Ridá Khán,
> the Qavámuʾl-Mulk [III], was in Tihrán, and the condition of there was
> unstable and tumultuous, as various groups had conﬂicting agendas and
> diﬀering objectives. Every year, a new governor would be appointed for
> Fárs, but because of the nation-wide turmoil and mayhem, he would
> be dismissed from oﬃce and in a most absurd manner quit the region. [p.525]

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 191                                                                    7/10/2008 3:45:34 PM

> Therefore, by then, no one was willing to accept Tihrán’s oﬀer of this post.
> However, Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk, did accede to this
overture and arrived back at Shíráz as the new governor-general.

Upon entry into Shíráz he moved quickly to consolidate his position
> and establish order. He appointed his eldest son, Habíbuʾlláh Khán, as his
> deputy, and his younger son, Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí Khán, the Nasruʾd-
> Dawlih, was put in charge of the armed forces. He further invited to
> the governor’s oﬃce the most prominent leaders of diverse groups and
> publicly bestowed the robe of honor upon them. In short, he managed
> to completely seize the reins of the aﬀairs of Fárs into his capable and
powerful hands.

This fact, however, did not sit well with the rivals of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk,
> that is, the Núrí family—the descendents of Hájí Amír and Mírzá Naʿím
> Núrí, who were mentioned earlier during the course of the Nayríz episodes
> and the events related to the illustrious Vahíd, and who constituted a
> family that was most keenly antagonistic toward this sacred Faith. A deep
> and entrenched animosity had always existed between the Núrí and the
> Qavám families, and they despised Qavámuʾl-Mulk’s absolute authority.
> Therefore, they began to agitate in opposition, provoked the populace, and
> won over the ʿulamá and beturbanned clerics to their designs. Gradually,
the pot of sedition came to a boil.

As was customary, the door of mischief was ﬁrst opened by heaping
> insults and abuses upon this much wronged community [i.e., Baháʾís],
> and the lead was taken by some of the ignorant yet seemingly learned
> ʿulamá who from before harbored belligerence towards the Qavámuʾl-
> Mulk. They would say, “All the aﬀairs and administration are handled
> by Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán [Dihqán], who is a Bábí and is
> among the chief lieutenants of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk. They desire unbridled
> authority, and with his collusion they plan on the conversion of Muslims
to the Bábí religion!”

Gradually, the standard of wickedness was hoisted, and the ﬂame of
> malice and rebellion was fueled beyond invectives and cursing, evolving
> into beatings and injuries. Whenever any of the Baháʾís were seen in the
> bazaar, without exception, they would be publicly subject to severe tor-
ment and harm.

This time the situation was worse than in previous upheavals, since in
> the past the principal target of assault was the governor, with the Qavám
> identiﬁed with the side of the populace and to some degree always able
> to exert inﬂuence to prevent the crazed mob from injuring the friends.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 192                                                                       7/10/2008 3:45:34 PM

The Constitutional Revolt

> Upon receiving this report and learning of the situation in Fárs, Ghulám-
> Husayn Khán Ghaﬀárí, who was one of the special ministers and among
> the governor’s ablest administrators, was appointed governor-general of
> Fárs. Since he was a wise politician, he telegraphed the appointment
> of the Mudabbiruʾs-Saltanih Núrí, who was the author of the mischief
> and troubles, as the deputy-governor, and himself left in haste for
Shíráz.

He arrived towards the end of AH 1324 [circa November 1906] and
> moved quickly to seize full control. Several experienced ministers accom-
> panied him, such as, the Mustawﬁ-Nizám, who eﬀectively dealt with all
> the details. They were able to ensure that none in the city committed a
> transgression against another, and that those uttering religious insults were [p.530]
summarily arrested and punished.

During this period, the incident of Tihrán occurred, and the wide-
> spread revolt and turmoil in the course of the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih’s rule, then
> governor of Tihrán, spilled over to the rest of the nation. As Muzaﬀariʾd-
> Dín Sháh was constantly ill and disappointed in absolutist monarchy, he

> representative to serve on the National Consultative Parliament, and this
fact was telegraphed to all the governors and provinces.320

As soon as this matter was noised about in Shíráz, once again turmoil
> commenced, and people divided into several factions. One group rose
> in support of the constitutional movement, while another in opposition.
> Many diverse [political] parties were formed, including the democrats, the
> freedom party, the conservatives, the constitutionalists, and the absolute
> monarchists. Each of these diverse parties developed activities, organized
> meetings, identiﬁed candidates, published position statements, authored
> manifestos and policies, made speciﬁc promises, and forged alliances over
> the text of the Qurʾán. Far more than at any time in the past, political
activism became the norm.

The absolute monarchists would say in one voice, “All of these uproars
> are incited by the Baháʾís; they are promoting the constitutional movement.
> Since they have suﬀered previously at the hand of the central govern-
> ment and have suﬀered under its coercion, they now exert themselves in
> wrecking the majesty of the Throne, and in the name of constitutional
> law emancipate themselves and cause trouble for the righteous Islamic
nation, nay see to its reduction and destruction.”

Conversely, the constitutionalists would say unanimously, “The Bábís
> and Baháʾís are antagonists toward parliamentary rule and supporters of
> absolute monarchy. They do not wish to see the nation ruled and organized
> by a uniﬁed code of law. In the present [revolutionary] chaos, it is they
> who gain most by promoting their wayward ideas through the illiterate
and ignorant masses.”

And yet the democrats would claim, “We champion the masses who
> must be liberated by any means possible from the injustice of the absolutist
> yoke and led to the haven of freedom and comfort.” The foremost enemy
> of the Baháʾís were the Democratic Party, as they constantly connived to
> cause trouble and diﬃculties for this much-wronged people.

Some time earlier, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá in a Tablet addressed to Núriʾd-Dín, had revealed

(INBMC vol. 52, p. 290):

> Praise be to God that His Majesty the King exerts the utmost patience, and with
> justice and equity wards oﬀ tyranny and favoritism. In a similar manner, the pillars
> of the monarchy and the ministers of the government will not tolerate the injustice
> of certain unwise elements and will exert themselves to bring forth the comfort and
> happiness of the people. Pray that His Majesty Muzaﬀar [Sháh] may prevail and
> his enemies be reduced and vanquished. For verily this Monarch is compassionate
> and merciful.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 194                                                                                  7/10/2008 3:45:34 PM

It was not long before Muzaﬀariʾd-Dín Sháh passed away and Muham-
> mad-ʿAlí Sháh came to the Throne [in January 1907]. Once more, the
> ﬁeld of mischief was thronged with ill-intentioned men who persuaded
> the Sháh against constitutional law, and he tried to rule as an absolute
> monarch. From various provinces, men who were not in favor of constitu-
> tional reform were summoned to Tihrán, and each was given new orders
> [to combat the opposition] and sent forth as governors or other oﬃcers.
> Included in this was Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk, who
> [having sided with the Sháh] was called to Tihrán, and after receiving
> full instructions returned to Shíráz where he formed a number of secret
> societies and swayed his conﬁdants against the constitution and in favor
> of absolutist rule and its beneﬁts. These activities, however, only served
to fuel the revolution.

From various regions, certain agents, known as Mujáhid,321 arrived.

> One group came from Tabríz, with diverse clothing; some others from
> Burújird; some from Rasht or Mázandarán; and from other places. The [p.535]
> town’s mischief-makers were particularly joyous over these devious develop-
> ments and created their own Mujáhid Society. Each of its members was
tasked with the murder of several [opposition ﬁgures].

The ʿulamá were also divided into two camps: one supporting the
> Qavámuʾl-Mulk [and his royalist sentiments], while the other was advo-
> cating constitutional reform and [parliamentary] law. The sole point of
> unity among all the diverse groups was their mutual animosity towards the
> divine friends [Baháʾís] and their abuse and insults of the believers. Every
> preacher who ascended the pulpit would devote his entire sermon, from the
> beginning to the end, to bitter denunciation, assault, and opprobrium of
> the Cause, and slanders and calumny against its wronged adherents. They
> would say, “The very authors of the constitutional movement are these
> people [Baháʾís]. This is because the foremost objective of this wayward
> group and the principal teaching of this insidious party are to strengthen
> the foundation of the constitutional and republican movement. We must
> exert our utmost to thoroughly eradicate these loathsome and ungodly
> people to ensure the tranquility of the nation and protect the radiance
> of Islam. Should anything other than this be attempted, the peace and
> freedom that we cherish will never be achieved.”

From the root word of Jihád [to exert], this term typically signiﬁes freedom ﬁghters.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 195                                                                                      7/10/2008 3:45:34 PM

Similarly, every cleric or preacher who was supportive of the constitu-
> tional reform would devote his entire sermon or homily to the destruction
> and extermination of the Baháʾís. They would say, “The main supporters
> of despotism are the Baháʾís. We must ﬁrst thoroughly uproot them so
> that the absolutists are frustrated and constitutional law is promulgated
throughout the land.”

And when the Mujáhidíns arrived, the absolutists claimed, “Mujáhidíns
> are entirely Bábís!” And likewise, the constitutionalists insisted, “Mujáhidíns
> are all Bábís!” In the midst of all this commotion, the believers were given
> not a moment’s rest or respite, and were the objects of attack of every party.
> As the famous adage states, “Harm always comes to the weak!” After the
> public’s ears were ﬁlled with such sentiments and the Qavámuʾl-Mulk’s
> objectives became universally known, the citizens of Shíráz were divided
> into three factions:

> • A large majority who were constitutionalists;
> • The absolutist supporters of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk;
> • And the moderates, meaning those who had no views.

> Once aﬀairs were arranged, various coalitions established, and groups
> organized, Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk, made a public
> announcement, summoning the whole of Shíráz and every strata of society,
> including the distinguished ʿulamá, the wealthy, the merchants, shop-
> keepers, farmers and others, to a meeting in Masjid Naw at three hours
> before dusk on Thursday. For this purpose the mosque’s courtyard was
> carpeted, tea and water-pipes were readied, and a number of ushers and
> servants enlisted. In the afternoon, rank upon rank of Shírázís gathered
> at the Masjid, and throngs ﬁlled the balconies and adjacent verandas, all
> waiting with great anticipation to see what would transpire and what end
> was to be achieved. After tea, water-pipes, and refreshments were served
> to the gentlemen, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk stood to deliver his speech. In their
> eagerness to hear his words, people pressed closer to hear him more clearly
and to learn his purpose.

Standing at the top of a pulpit made of ancient stone, the Qavámuʾl-
> Mulk commenced in a resonant voice by ﬁrst praising the majesty, the
> glory, and the sovereignty of Qájár Dynasty, and spoke especially of
> the abilities, courage, and the valor of Muhammad-ʿAlí Sháh. He then
> added:

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 196                                                                         7/10/2008 3:45:34 PM

> O ye, citizens of Fárs! Unlike other places, you must be devoted to the
> Sháh and aid the government, and must not be swayed by insidious and
> evil-minded individuals. The people that bestir themselves in opposition to

> The scheme put forward at present and known as “constitutional monarchy”

> Currently, they wish to implement their true intent in its entirety. Since you [p.540]
> are not familiar with them, I will now prove this to you and demonstrate
> it adequately so that you might be fully assured of it.

> With this comment, he pulled out a copy of the Kitáb-i Aqdas from his
overcoat and with the resonant voice read the following verse:

> Let nothing grieve thee, O Land of Tá,322 for God hath chosen thee to be

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 197                                                                                 7/10/2008 3:45:35 PM

I have just come from Tihrán and know well what is transpiring in the cap-
> ital. Today, the Bábís and Baháʾís are the promoters of constitutional reform.
> All the disturbances in Tihrán during the reign of the late Muzaﬀariʾd-Dín
> Sháh were at the hand of these people! Since the late Muzaﬀariʾd-Dín Sháh
> was in ill-health and depressed and having no other recourse, he signed
> the constitution. However, His Majesty Muhammad-ʿAlí Sháh is against
> such a notion, as he is fully aware that such erroneous concept is based on
> Baháʾuʾlláh’s promise to His people! Of a certainty, you will aid and succor
> your loving Sovereign in this important matter.

> Having uttered such calumnies, he descended from the pulpit. Present
> at the gathering were several of the leading constitutionalists, such as
> Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir Istahbánátí, Siyyid Ahmad Dashtakí, Hájí ʿAlí
> Áqá Dhúʾr-Riyásatyn [twin chiefs], and some others. Unable to hold back
their fury, they protested vigorously and forcibly stated:

> With these nonsensical comments, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk intends to confuse
> people and uproot the constitution. However, it is now impossible to erase
> this sentiment [i.e., reform] from people’s mind. The tree of the constitu-
> tion, the choicest fruit of which is the law, will never be uprooted! The feast
> of absolutists and despotism will never again be spread, and the likes you
> can never enjoy its corrupt beneﬁts. No longer will you be masters, able
> to rule as feudal landlords where you can enslave the working masses and
> treat them as purchased possessions!

> Following such protests, a huge uproar and commotion ensued, and it was
> feared that many among the assemblage in the mosque would be killed.
> When the Qavám realized that the atmosphere was too explosive, he aban-
> doned his kinsmen and party supporters and quietly slipped away using a
> small door beneath the pulpit. When he reached the outside, he mounted
[a steed] and with great haste ﬂed to his [well-protected] residence.

Afterwards, Hájí Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir Istahbánátí, Hájí Siyyid
> Ahmad Dashtakí Muʿínuʾl-Islám, and Hájí ʿAlí Áqá Dhúʾr-Riyásatyn
> together with the Democratic Party and the Mujáhidín gathered in the
> home of the Dhúʾr-Riyásatyn and collectively agreed, “Muhammad-Ridá
> Khán’s speech against the Baháʾís was based on seditious plans, and we
> should not heed it in the least, but must ignore it completely. The Qavám’s
> purpose is to disrupt the constitutional process and has nothing to do with
> the teaching of the Bábís and Baháʾís. He wishes to once again subjugate
the people under his own vain imaginings and schemes.”

To this, Hájí ʿAlí Áqá added, “I know well that Baháʾís would never
> interfere in governmental aﬀairs or political discussions, much less would
> they agitate to sway the nation, be it toward constitutional reform or

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 198                                                                               7/10/2008 3:45:35 PM

> toward maintaining absolutism. The purpose of the Qavám in his talk
> at the Masjid was to discredit the reformists and to turn people against
> the constitutionalists by associating the constitutional movement with
the Bábís and Baháʾís”

Hájí Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir noted, “And what harm is there even
> if it were so? For us constitutionalists, the best thing would be for the [p.545]
> entire country, from whatever rank or creed, to support such parliamen-
> tary reforms. If they [i.e., Baháʾís] are patriotic and nationalistic, then
> it behooves them to support the constitutionalist party. And if they are
> against such reforms, then it is of cardinal importance to thoroughly
eradicate them from this land.”

And ﬁnally, Hájí Muʿínuʾl-Islám commented, “It is imperative for all
> Iranian citizens to be supportive of the constitution and to repudiate the
> tyranny of absolutism, and this includes all Jews, Christians, Muslims,
> the Bábís and Baháʾís. We must never heed the kind of calumny uttered
today by the Qavám.”

When the Qavámists became apprised of the report of the constitution-
> alists’ discussions, they spread far and wide among the bazaar shopkeepers
> the claim that “Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir and Hájí ʿAli Áqá are Bábís.
Because if they were not, they would never speak in such a manner.”

In short, this much-wronged community was a target of both sides
> who would use it as an excuse to advance their own agenda. That is, the
> constitutionalists would say, “Baháʾís support the absolutists,” and the
> monarchists would claim, “Baháʾís are the mainstay of the constitutional
> movement.” And such news and proclamations were profoundly diﬃcult
> for the friends to bear. The matter escalated to such a degree that they
> could not even leave their homes or step into the streets, since doing so
> carried the risk of running into one of the factions and being harmed
> or mistreated.

Multiple Assassinations

> On Saturday, 1 Safar AH 1326 [5 March 1908],324 from the early morn-
> ing hours until half an hour before lunch, Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the
> Qavámuʾl-Mulk, met with a number of his men in a large orchard adjacent

Bámdád, Sharh Hál Rijál Iran, vol. 3, p. 401, places this event a year earlier on
February 1907 when Qavám was 57 years of age.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 199                                                                               7/10/2008 3:45:35 PM

> to his private residence. He encouraged them to act against the wishes
> and interests of the constitutionalists and made plans for factions [under
> his control] to undertake various demonstrations and protests. Having
> completed his discussions and plans, he returned to the inner apartment
> of his home for lunch and, while he was descending the stairs, a certain
> Mujáhid, known among people as Niʿmatuʾlláh Burújirdí, shot the Qavám
> three times in the heart with a small German pistol. Forthwith, Muham-
mad-Ridá Khán left this world of pain for the world above.

A huge uproar ensued in the Qavám’s courtyard and orchard, and the
> assassin was seized and on the spot fatally beaten by ﬁsts, kicks, sticks,
> and stones—and he too was relieved of the aﬄictions of this merciless
> world. Afterwards, they thoroughly searched his person to see what
> documentation could be found to identify the instigator of this crime,
but none could be found.

Failing in their search, they nevertheless raised the cry, “Niʿmatuʾlláh
> Burújirdí was a Bábí! The Qavám’s assassins were the Bábís! The murder
> was ordered by Mírzá Husayn Khán Kávarí, the Muʿtamiduʾd-Díván!”
> [They were placing this blame with] the Muʿtamiduʾd-Díván, because by
> virtue of his exceptional courage, valor, and audacity, it was well known
> among the populace that he was a Baháʾí, and no one doubted his alle-
> giance to the Faith. Moreover, [it was learned that] Niʿmatuʾlláh Burújirdí
> had stayed at his [the Muʿtamiduʾd-Dívánʾs] home, and therefore they
> were convinced that all evidence pointed to him regarding the Qavám’s
assassination.

In short, the remains of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk were washed, coﬃned, and
> laid out. His personal Husayniyyih was canopied, where a large mourning
> gathering and prayer vigil was organized with throngs of people from every
> class, such as distinguished ʿulamá, merchants, shopkeepers, and other
diverse groups came to share in the mourning from morn until eve.

On the third and the ﬁnal day of the bereavements, approaching noon-
> time, all the ʿulamá, businessmen, and prominent citizens of Shíráz had
> gathered for the occasion, and Habíbuʾlláh Khán and Mírzá Muhammad-
> ʿAlí Khán, the Nasruʾd-Dawlih, [the Qavám’s two sons] were sitting next
[p.550] to each other greeting the mourners. At midday the gathering concluded

> and the two gentlemen rose to thank the mourners and bid them farewell.
> Among the participants were members of the Democratic Party as well
> as [the leading constitutionalists] Áqá Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir Istah-
> bánátí and Hájí Siyyid Ahmad Dashtakí, known as the Muʿínuʾl-Islám.
> Of a sudden, the sound of a gunshot was heard, and Habíbuʾlláh Khán
> collapsed to the ground screaming. His people cried out, “Once more,

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 200                                                                  7/10/2008 3:45:35 PM

> they have assassinated our master!” And with that, they quickly whisked
him away over their shoulders to his home.

In the ensuing pandemonium, frightened people were fleeing in
> every direction and included among them were the aforementioned Áqá
> Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir and Hájí Siyyid Ahmad, the Muʿínuʾl-Islám,
> who quickly exited the Husayniyyih and proceeded in haste toward
> their residence. However, they were followed by the Qavámuʾl-Mulk’s
> supporters, who bruited about that Áqá [i.e., Habíbuʾlláh Khán] was
> shot. After a short distance, one of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk’s men shot Áqá
> Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir in the back. He fell to the ground injured and
> screaming when a certain Sabbágh [painter] saw him and lifted him over
> his shoulders, and tried to carry him home, but both he and the Shaykh
were shot dead on the spot from behind.

Subsequent to the Shaykh’s assassination, Hájí Siyyid Ahmad, the
> Muʿínuʾl-Islám, was chased with the greatest haste, seized, and brought
> back to the Husayniyyih where he was brutally murdered. His remains
> were hung from the entrance, and the cry was raised, “We have exacted
> a revenge for our master’s death and killed his murderers! Now the rest
> of the wayward and inﬁdel Bábís can see what we intend!” With that,
> they burnt the corpse with straw and kerosene, and dragged it for some
> time through the streets and the bazaar, eventually throwing it into a well,
known as the Qalʿih-Bandar, on the Saʿdiyyih Mountain.

It should be easy to imagine the sort of tumult that overtook the city
> at that time and how wicked people took advantage of all these pretexts
> to cause mischief. All thoughts and discussions were solely on the issue
> of the Bábís and Baháʾís. It was an obstreperous and turbulent period.
> Anyone who committed a villainous act would blame it on this Faith and
> its adherents. Everyone admittedly maintained that both the murder of
> the Qavám and the injury of [his son] Habíbuʾlláh Khán were the doing
> of the Bábís! They even widely spread rumors in the city that it was solely
> the Bábís who killed Shaykh Muhammad-Báqir and in a heinous manner
> burnt [Hájí Siyyid Ahmad] Muʿínuʾl-Islám! In unanimity they would cry
> out, “The Bábís committed all these deeds and atrocities!” Thus, each day
brought a new wave of persecution.

By then the situation between the two contending factions of the
> constitutionalists and the royalists had reached its peak and deteriorated
> into open murder and battle. Animosity had reached its zenith, and the
> two sides constantly imprecated each other. The governor reported the
> matter to Tihrán at length and asked the court for instructions on how
> to deal with the situation. The Royal Court replied that Muhammad-Ridá

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 201                                                                    7/10/2008 3:45:35 PM

> Khán’s [the Qavámuʾl-Mulk] sons were to be sent to Europe. Therefore,
> both Habíbuʾlláh Khán and Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí Khán, the Nasruʾd-
> Dawlih, were sent by the governor from Shíráz to Búshihr and from
thence to Europe.

With their departure from Shíráz, Fárs became somewhat tranquil,
> since at least the absolutists’ main support was withdrawn. Gradually, the
> constitutionalists grew in strength and number, and the vast majority of
> the multitude favored parliamentary reforms. Nevertheless, the insidious
> elements continued to ensure that the Faith remained current in people’s
> mind and that it was blamed for every wicked incident.

The Itihád Islám Society

> During this time, the foes and enemies [of the Baháʾí Faith] organized a
> society known as the Itihád Islám [the Islamic unity] with the sole objec-
> tive of opposing, countering, battling, and eradicating this much-wronged
> Faith.325 During the months of Muharram, Safar, and Ramadán, from every
> mosque and pulpit, they would launch bitter denunciations and engage in
[p.555] slander and insults [against the Baháʾí Cause]. They taught their lads to

> confront the believers in the streets, by their shops and stores, to loudly
> curse and scorn them, and to pursue their victims with rocks and stones.
> The Baháʾí children were particular targets of these vicious assaults and
> were repeatedly attacked every time they came outside. Several despicable
> and bitter foes penned polemics in verse, put on the garb of dervishes and
> constantly frequented the streets, the bazaars, the mosques, and all the
> public places, resonantly chanting these poems—and in between verses
> insulting and vilifying the Cause—and after having defamed the Sacred
> Figures, they would heap contempt upon each of the renowned believers,
> who were named individually. Hearing such profane mocking and being
> the subject of relentless attacks would cause the believers to shed bitter
> tears and would break their hearts. We knew not what we could do to
lessen this fury.

It was during this time that many Tablets were revealed by ʿAbduʾl-Bahá
> in honor of various friends, and in these He strictly forbade the believers
> from participating in political aﬀairs, disallowed involvement in political
> parties, and proscribed membership in any of the factions. He admon-

The genesis of pan-Islamism and of this society are rooted in the eﬀorts of Siyyid
Jamáluʾd-Dín Afghání.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 202                                                                                  7/10/2008 3:45:35 PM

> ished the believers to dissociate themselves from any entity from whose
> activities the odor of dissension and disunity could be perceived. He even
> instructed the friends neither to attend rallies and demonstrations that
> could be construed as political in nature, nor to accept membership in
> any society, that they might remain safe and protected. In light of these
> instructions from our beloved Master, none of the believers attended any
> political gatherings or became entangled with any party. When any of
> our coreligionists was invited to attend a [political] gathering or join a
> party or in some way join with a society, he would oﬀer an excuse and
> not participate—this held true even on occasions where such participation
> was demanded. Believers’ avoidance of such activities and their lack of
> support for various cabals, of necessity, served to deepen people’s enmity
> and suspicion toward us.

Meeting with a Leading Constitutionalist

> In those days, the present writer had a particular matter to discuss with
> Hájí ʿAlí Áqá Dhúʾr-Riyásatyn and as such went to see him.326 Typically
> when we met, he would inquire about various Baháʾí subjects and tidings,
> and would especially inquire after ʿAbduʾl-Bahá, as he was very attached
to the Faith.

However, that day, upon seeing me, he inquired, “Why do you isolate
> yourself, avoid membership in political parties, and disassociate yourself
> therefrom? Is it not the case that Baháʾís also cherish establishment of
> constitutional laws? Is it not true that Baháʾuʾlláh in the Kitáb-i Aqdas and
> the Tablet of the World 327 has clearly and emphatically enjoined upon Iran
> the acquisition of a constitutional framework? Therefore, it seems evident
> that you [Baháʾís] must be more supportive of this eﬀort than others and
> exert your utmost to promote this critical undertaking. Certainly, you will
> not be well served by your avoidance of these parties and absence from the
> democratically organized gatherings. You must be present and succor such
> eﬀorts, and encourage and persuade all the Baháʾís to attend as well.”

Hájí ʿAlí Áqá was the chief of the Niʿmatuʾlláhí mystical order of Shíráz, and Mírzá
> Habíbuʾlláh has added the following parenthetical comments about him: “The Hájí ʿAli
> Áqá was a most righteous and good-natured man who had a considerable knowledge of
> this Cause. He would attend the private meetings of the friends and was well acquainted
> with the divine verses. Indeed, he even owned many [Baháʾí] books, such as Ishráqát,
Mufávidát [Some Answered Questions], the Kitáb-i Aqdas, and the [Kitáb-i] Fará ʾid.”

Baháʾuʾlláh, Tablets of Bahá ʾuʾlláh, pp. 83–97.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 203                                                                                   7/10/2008 3:45:35 PM

Noting that he was adamant in his view, this servant replied with wis-
> dom, “Clearly, Your Excellency is correct in everything you have stated. We,
> too, deeply desire constitutional reform and have no objections whatsoever
> to it. After all, as your own good self has mentioned, it is one of the divine
> promises that Iran will be adorned with the rule of law. However, as we
> are much too renowned, were we to participate in your political rallies, it
> would provide the absolutists with an excuse to discourage people from
> the constitutional reform and would make this fundamental document
> a plaything of the ignorant. That is, with our participation, you will
> not succeed. Wisdom is imperative under all conditions. You know full
[p.560] well that the Party of God [i.e., Baháʾís] not only does not oppose your
proposed reforms, but also is most supportive of them.”

On hearing this reasoning, he stated, “Of course you are right, and
> I agree too. But do your best to nurse people into adoption of the
> constitution.”

Formation of the First Local Spiritual Assembly of Shíráz

> In the midst of all the turmoil and worries, and at the height of the
> [constitutional] revolt, emphatic instructions were issued from the Holy
> Land for the formation of the Local Spiritual Assembly [of Shíráz]—that
> is, nine believers who received the highest number of votes were to con-
> gregate once a week to consult on all spiritual matters and on ways of
> ensuring the community’s continual, strict avoidance of political aﬀairs
and membership in various parties.

Therefore, on Friday, 5 Jamádíyuʾl-Avval AH 1325 [5 June 1908], the
> entire Baháʾí community of every creed came together in the home of
> Hájí Mírzá ʿAlí, known as Taryakí. The following nine believers received
> the highest votes: Mírzá Áqá Khán Bashíru’s-Sultán; Áqá Mírzá Muham-
> mad-Báqir Khán; Áqá Siyyid Muhammad-Husayn Afnán; Áqá Mírzá Áqá
> Afnán; Hájí Mírzá Buzurg Afnán; Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí-Muhammad Khán, the
> Muvaqarruʾd-Dawlih; Mírzá ʿAlí Ashraf ʿAndalíb; Hájí Mírzá Husayn-ʿAlí
ʿUmúmmí; and Hájí Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh Afnán.

The Assembly resolved to meet on Fridays at three o’clock in the
> afternoon at the [Báb’s] martyred uncle’s house, which ʿAbduʾl-Bahá
> had designated as a Mashriquʾl-Adhkár. In accordance with the Master’s
> instruction, the late Muvaqarruʾd-Dawlih had purchased two-thirds of
> this house, which had belonged to non-Baháʾís, and had donated it to
> the Faith. The remaining third belonged to three groups of the Afnán

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 204                                                                     7/10/2008 3:45:36 PM

> family: the children of Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán; the descendants
> of Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Hasan, the Afnán Kabír; and Zahrá Bagum. They,
> too, had ceded their shares to the Faith, and therefore in its entirety the
house belonged to the Cause.

In short, the Assembly meetings were held in this sacred location. With
> the utmost care, the Assembly was vigilant that none among the believers
> would associate in any way with any of the political parties and that the
> friends would avoid entanglement in such trappings.

The Murder of the Muʿtamiduʾd-Díván

> In that year, Sultán Masʿúd Mírzá, the Zillu’s-Sultán, was appointed gov-
> ernor-general of Fárs. Upon arrival, since the Qavámuʾl-Mulk’s sons were
> no longer in Shíráz, he gave Mírzá Husayn Khán, the Muʿtamiduʾd-Díván,
> the rights over the ʿArab and Khamísh tribes which had been part of the
Qavám’s estate. And the story of that incident is as follows.

At the beginning of the absolutists’ movement, the Muʿtamiduʾd-Díván
> was among the inner circle of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk’s most trusted men.
> Since Muhammad-Ridá Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk, explicitly trusted these
> two men, he would not attempt any undertakings without consultation and
> without the concurrence of Mírzá Husayn Khán and Áqá Mírzá Muham-
> mad-Báqir Khán. However, during the ﬁrst tenure of the governorship
> of Mírzá Ahmad Khán, the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih, a grave misunderstanding
> occurred between the Muʿtamiduʾd-Díván and the Qavámuʾl-Mulk that
> eventually escalated into open belligerency.328 The former completely
> withdrew from the aﬀairs of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk and threw his lot with
the Qavám’s enemies, aiding their designs.

ʿAbduʾl-Bahá was informed of this situation and in several sacred Tab-
> lets addressed to Muhammad-Husayn Mírzá, the Muʾayyadu’s-Saltanih,
> emphatically stated, “Mírzá Husayn Khán and Muhammad-Ridá Khán
> must be united with one another. Setting aside their diﬀerences and
> enmities, they must associate with each other in oneness and harmony.
> However, should they do otherwise, a grievous end awaits them both.”
> The Master’s admonishment was shared with both, but to no avail. Later,
> during the constitutional revolt, [as foretold by ʿAbduʾl-Bahá] the Qavám
> perished.

As a prelude to this division, the Qavám subjected Mírzá Husayn Khán to the
bastinado, an act which he greatly resented.

RABBANI_f1_1-220.indd 205                                                                         7/10/2008 3:45:36 PM

[p.565]       As the Muʿtamiduʾd-Díván was fully informed of the extent of the

> Qavámuʾl-Mulk’s estate, he organized a large contingent of armed force
> and together with artillery and many soldiers proceeded in the direction
> of the ʿArab tribe in hope of fully consolidating the divergent elements
> of the estate. Informed of this undertaking, the Qavám’s family, however,
planned to murder Mírzá Husayn Khán.

With grandeur and much ceremony, in Rabíʿuʾl-Avval AH 1325 [April
> 1907]329 the camp moved from Shíráz and at a distance of ﬁfteen farsang,
> in the vicinity of Saydún, a certain ʿAskar Khán ʿArab, one of the ʿArab
> Kalántars, shot Mírzá Husayn Khán from behind. Seeing the latter fall
> from his horse, his brother, ʿAbbás Khán, quickly reached him, but he
too was shot dead.

A great pandemonium ensued, and the camp fell in complete disar-
> ray. In no time, the ʿArab tribesmen seized the supply of guns, artilleries,
> tents, and provisions. When this news reached Shíráz, a blanket of fear
> enshrouded the city, as everyone was deeply frightened of the prospect
> of heavily armed ʿArab tribes attacking the city and leaving none stand-
> ing. In this fear, all were united—whether reformist, royalist, democrat,
> moderates, or Mujáhid—all felt the same way. No longer was anyone
> speaking of the Bábís or Baháʾís. Everyone was apprehensive as to what
fate awaited them.

It was during this time that Muhammad-ʿAlí Sháh [disrupted the
> reforms and] discharged his cannons on the Parliament Building, seizing
> and executing several of the opposition. However, uniting their forces,
> Sipahdár from the North and Sardár Asʿad Bakhtíyár from the South
> attacked Tihrán, took the command of aﬀairs into their own hands, and
> surrounded the royal palace. Muhammad-ʿAlí Sháh ﬂed to the Russian
> Consulate and took refuge there. The Parliament dethroned the latter,
> and since Ahmad Mírzá had not reached the age of maturity, he was
> named the Throne’s vice-regent.330 In haste, Muhammad-ʿAli Mírzá left
the capital.

All the ministers and governors appointed during the reign of Muham-
> mad-ʿAli Mírzá were summoned to Tihrán, including Zillu’s-Sultán who
> was dismissed from his post in Fárs.

Given that the Zilluʾs-Sultán became the governor of Fárs during AH 1326, “AH

Muhammad-ʿAlí Sháh’s abdication occurred on 16 July 1909.

The Governorship of Ásifuʾd-Dawlih

> Ghulám-Ridá Khán, the Ásifuʾd-Dawlih Sháhsún, was appointed to the
> oﬃce of governor-general of Fárs and with a large contingent [of armed
> forces] arrived in Shíráz on Jamádíyʾth-Thání AH 1326 [July 1908]. He
> was a Turk, an ineﬀective administrator, and incapable of rule in Fárs.
> During his tenure, the aﬀairs of Fárs were in total chaos, and anyone could
> commit any act he wished. The rabble and the enemies took advantage
> of the situation and were committing all manners of atrocities against
> the believers—far worse than before. With the utmost cruelty, the friends
suﬀered great diﬃculties.331

Not long thereafter, after a sojourn in Europe, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk’s
> sons returned in accord with the wishes of the government and came to
Fárs.

Day-by-day, the believers grew in their love and rapture in the Cause.

> The greater the intensity of persecution and tyranny against them, the
> greater their unity and fellowship. Despite all the obstacles, day and night
> they were immersed in serving the Faith, teaching its healing Message,
> and awakening souls. During this time, Áqá Mírzá Tarázuʾlláh, son of the
> illustrious Samandar, and Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí-Akbar Rafsinjání arrived in Shíráz
> and commenced teaching in that city and its environs, such as Ábádih,
> Nayríz, Sarvistán,332 Dariyán, Jahrum,333 and other places, and succeeded
> in enrolling a large number under the banner of God’s divine canopy.

As an example of civil disorder in this period, the following comment by Abúʾl-Qásim
> Afnán was shared for inclusion as a footnote (private communication, December 1997):
> “During the Ásifuʾd-Dawlih’s rule, Mírzá ʿAlí-Muhammad Khán, the Muvaqqariʾd-Daw-
> lih, occupied a senior position in the British Consulate, and his job often required him
> to visit the governor. One day on his return from such a visit, his carriage was attacked,
> his horse shot dead, and he stripped of all possessions. In this state, he returned to the
> governor’s residence, harshly stating, ‘The aﬀairs in the province have deteriorated to such
> a point that shots are ﬁred on a man of my standing, and he is assaulted in the front of
> the Governor’s Ark!’ The Ásifuʾd-Dawlih replied, ‘The attackers were your own gunmen
> instructed to kill Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán and in error attacked you instead.’ These
> kind of incidents and incompetence were communicated to Tihrán, and soon the Ásifuʾd-
> Dawlih was removed from the oﬃce, and Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán, the Sahámuʾd-Dawlih, was
appointed as the governor-general of Fárs.”

Sarvistán had changed its character from the earlier days when Baháʾís were perse-
> cuted. By then most of the town’s inﬂuential ﬁgures and headmen were Baháʾís. The Baháʾí
> community of this town lived in relative tranquility and was a refuge for Baháʾís of other
communities who occasionally had to escape the wrath of persecution.

At that time Jahrum had more than 500 Baháʾís and was administered by Siyyid
> Muhammad, son of Siyyid ʿAbduʾl-Husayn Lárí. Both father and son perpetrated great
> harm against the Baháʾí Faith at later dates.

CHAPTER SIXTEEN

BAHÁʾÍ MARTYRDOM IN NAYRÍZ

[p.570:1] During this period [winter of 1909], the heart-wrenching, heart-rending

> event of Nayríz occurred, and the details of that incident, perpetrated by
Hájí Siyyid ʿAbduʾl-Husayn Lárí,334 are as follows:

With his seat of power situated in Lár—a place known particularly for
> its warm [and inhospitable] climate—Hájí Siyyid ʿAbduʾl-Husayn was a
> low-ranking, ordinary cleric. He had built a long and checkered record
> in deceiving people. Gradually, he expanded his circle of inﬂuence to
> include such regions as Bastak, Lár, Galih-Dár, Jahrum, Dáráb, and Sar-
> Kúh. The inhabitants of those territories had fallen under his spell to such
> extent that they would consider it imperative to obey his every wish, nay,
> would deem his commands more meritorious and obligatory than their
> religious duties. In such depth had his authority penetrated the hearts of
> the population that if he were to declare their wives forbidden unto them,
> the people would immediately obey and would maintain their separation.
> They had noised abroad many stories of miracles and prodigies about him
> and would say, “Áqá, spreads his prayer mat on the pool and oﬀers his
> prayers standing on the water! He ascends the fence and canters upon it
> like a mount!” Such rubbish had become the foundation of the ﬁrm belief
> of that region. They would even take his ablution water for medicinal
> purposes, and with colossal prices barter the same with one another. All
> this had enabled this man to greatly expand his inﬂuence.

Persecutions in Nayríz

> When the tumultuous news of Muhammad-ʿAlí Sháh’s abdication and
> the installation of General Asʿad [Bakhtiyárí as the Prime Minister] was
> received, this gave Siyyid ʿAbduʾl-Husayn new ideas. Arraying a large
> number of armed men around him, he began to cherish designs for an
> [independent] sovereignty and throne. He issued commands and orders,

> and sent these forth for execution; summoned all the rulers and chief-
> tains of the region, as far as Istahbánát and Nayríz, and incited them to
> submission and inﬂamed their greed; ordered a widespread jihád; seized
> and placed under his own rule all the government functions, such as the
> treasury, post oﬃce, and the police; printed stamps [under the title of
> “the nation of Islam”] and paper currency in his own name; he organized
> mercenary forces from local thugs; placed each district under the com-
mand of a savage rabble and ﬁxed a reign of terror.335

Among this latter group numbered Shaykh Zakariyyá [of Sar-Kúh],
> who was assigned the command of Sar-Kúh, Maʿádin, and the districts
> of Istahbánát and Nayríz. That barbarous tyrant, together with a force in
> excess of a thousand strong, all thoroughly bereft of humanity and civility,
> moved towards Nayríz. A distance of two days’ journey from town, he
wrote to the Shaykhuʾl-Islám [of Nayríz], stating essentially:

> His Excellency, the Ayatuʾlláh Áqá Hájí Siyyid ʿAbduʾl-Husayn has currently
> ascended the throne, and the constitutional monarch is none other besides
> him. All must show submissiveness before him by considering his every
> command their religious obligation. As in accord with the all-sovereign
> wishes of the illustrious Ayatuʾlláh, I have arrived in this region today, I
> hereby charge you that, congruent with the instructions contained in this
> letter, you chain and send before me all the absolutist monarchists so that
> I many send them under guard to the illustrious Ayatuʾlláh, the Sultánuʾl-
> Muslimín [the king of Muslims], that he may punish them in conformity
with Islamic jurisprudence.

Moreover, you are to purge Nayríz of all members of the wayward and
perverse Baháʾí community.

Should anything other than what is commanded in this letter occur,
> then stand forewarned that I will come forth to Nayríz and will show no
mercy to anyone.

Signed by me, Zakariyyá Ansárí
> And on the envelope he ﬁxed his seal, “Nasiruʾl-Islám” [the defender of [p.575]
> Islam].

Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán notes, “An example of Siyyid ʿAbduʾl-Husayn’s savagery was the
> beheading in his own home of seventy-two of the tribal chiefs and the nobility of Garash,
> one of the dependencies of Lár. He claimed these men were the promoters of the constitu-
> tion and the followers of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk [III]. When this news was communicated to
> Muhammad-ʿAlí Sháh, he sent a telegram to the Nasruʾd-Dawlih, who at that time was the
> military chief of Fárs, which read, ‘Beloved of the sovereign, Nasruʾd-Dawlih! Where art
> thou? Who is Siyyid ʿAbduʾl-Husayn? All hail to the king!’ Before an answer was received,
> the monarch was ousted from the throne” (private communication, August 1997).

Upon receipt of this letter in Nayríz, some opted to bend before his
> will, while others at ﬁrst remained neutral but eventually grew appre-
> hensive of grave consequences and resolved to defend themselves [against
> Shaykh Zakariyyá]. As a measure of protection, the inhabitants of Nayríz
> commissioned a number of gunmen to the Sayf-Ábád Fort and secured
> and established fortiﬁcations on all the elevated spots and prepared for
> defense. However, the residents of Sayf-Ábád were entirely in favor of
> the new regime, which allowed the Shaykh [Zakariyyá] and his rabble
> to beneﬁt immensely from the situation. [Noting this betrayal,] some of
> the Nayrízí gunmen quit their fortiﬁcation, while others threw in their
lot with the Shaykh and led him triumphantly to Nayríz.

At the head of a large contingent, the Shaykh arrived in Nayríz and
> opened his hands and gave vent to massive looting of all Muslims—even
> the home of the Shaykhuʾl-Islám. However, as the home of the Shaykhuʾl-
> Islám and the surrounding homes had established fortiﬁcations and
> turrets, he decided to select that quarter336 as his own headquarters and
fortress.

With much embellishment and great detail, [Shaykh Zakariyyá] wrote
> of his victory to Sar-Kúh and Istahbánát and told them of what had
> transpired in exaggerated language. Overtaken by greed, the residents of
> those towns decided to proceed to Nayríz, knowing well that booty and
> spoils of pillage awaited them. After such a beginning, he commenced the
> murder and plundering of Baháʾí residents and ignited the ﬁre of mischief
and fueled the ﬂames of hatred.

Meanwhile, Muhammad-Hasan Khán, the deputy-governor [of Nayríz],
> ﬂed the city. On hearing reports of the events, due to his innate incom-
> petence, Hájí Ásifuʾd-Dawlih [the governor-general of Fárs] failed to
intervene, thereby allowing the ﬂames of mischief to burn brightly.

On the Shaykh’s behalf, public criers proclaimed throughout Nayríz,
> “Anyone submitting a captive Baháʾí, will be rewarded with a riﬂe. Hence-
> forth, all Muslims are safe and secure. Our sole purpose is to slay all the
> Baháʾís and none other.” On hearing this announcement, the friends of
> the Merciful [i.e., Baháʾís], who had previously gathered in the Masjid
> Jamʿih and had fortiﬁed that stronghold, retreated and ﬂed.337 The vast

Masjid Jumʿih Kabírih was located in the old Chinár-Sukhtih quarter, where most

Baháʾí Martyrdoms

> The following day, [two of the believers,] Mullá Muhammad-ʿAlí and his
> son-in-law, Mullá Hasan, were working the farm ﬁelds of Bíd-Lang, and
> were found and seized by the agitators. Bound, they were taken to Shaykh
> Zakariyyá. “We have brought you Baháʾís!” they joyfully announced. That
> murderous tyrant and merciless tormenter immediately ordered their execu-
tion by ﬁring squad. Thus, those two wronged-ones were martyred.

This incident bolstered the people’s audacity, as they realized that in
> order to rescue themselves from the fury of [Shaykh] Zakariyyá and also
> win the blessings associated with the slaying of the Bábís—which they
> believed to be a meritorious deed—they needed to carry out his wish
[and round up the Baháʾís].

Next day, three more believers were taken to the Shaykh. However, he
> cunningly compelled them to turn over all their properties and possessions
to him, and then they were released.

Hungry, thirsty, and ﬁlled with anxiety, the wretched believers who
> had ﬂed from the city wandered over the mountains. After two days, the
> myrmidons and henchmen discovered their location and apprehended eight
> believers with the intention of taking them to the Shaykh. En route, the
> captives were subjected to all manner of mistreatment and brutality, to
> the point that by the time they arrived at the headquarters, no strength
> was left in them and blood poured from their ears and heads, and their
entire bodies were covered in injuries.

Upon arrival, one of them asked for water, but instead the ruthless
> Shaykh ordered his immediate martyrdom by gunﬁre. In short, each of [p.580]
the eight was slain in a diﬀerent manner.

Moreover, that day,339 ten more believers, each in a diﬀerent way,
> perished at the hand of the rabble. Ustád ʿAlí Sabbágh [the painter] was
> riddled with bullets in the Chinár-Sukhtih quarters, next to the Masjid

According to the narrative of Mullá Muhammad-Shafíʿ Nayrízí, during 1853, the
> Bábí community of Nayríz took to mountains where several hundred of them perished in
> the most gruesome manner through their struggles with the military forces sent against
them. For details see Rabbani, The Bábís of Nayríz: History and Documents.

The date of this event is Naw-Rúz 1909. On that very day, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá interred
the remains of the Báb on Mount Carmel, and the Baháʾís in Chicago resolved to raise

> [Jumʿih]. The remains of that wronged-one were burnt and the cinders
> thrown into a well. Mullá ʿAbduʾl-Majíd, a sixty-ﬁve-year-old believer
> who had recently become blind, was heartlessly pulled from his home and
> most severely beaten. They perpetrated upon that man what no pen dare
describe. At last, they repeatedly shot him and burned his remains.

In total, the number of martyred believers reached nineteen,340 and
> were I to describe the details of each, much like the ﬁrst Nayríz episode
> outlined earlier, it would become a lengthy epistle.341 It should suﬃce to
> note that this incident was in every way more severe, more brutal, and
more harrowing than the previous episodes.

For quite a while, the widowed women and orphaned children, having
> lost their husbands and fathers, and having witnessed their homes destroyed
> and all their possessions plundered, lived in such conditions that indeed
> will remain a grievous stain of disgrace for the world of humanity. The
> majority of them took refuge in the mosques or spent [the chilling nights]
> in the streets or in the ruins of what once were their homes, now reduced
> to naught but a pile of rubble. When any of them tried to take shelter in
> the homes of their non-Baháʾí [relatives], they were forcibly denied. Their
> sole consolation was that they had not been killed like their men—insults
> and hardships they could endure.

Refugees to Sarvistán

> For two days, innocent children and unprotected women lived with no
> food or provisions. Meanwhile, hundreds [of Baháʾís] ﬂed into the wil-
> derness, knowing well that should any of them be caught by the rabble,
> their lives would be in iniquitous peril. Among such desolate believers
> were seventy-two who retreated in the direction of Sarvistán. What these
> refugees endured is most heart-wrenching and on par with the martyrdom
> of the other captives among their co-religionists.

> the Mother Temple of the West—thus three sacred acts in the East, the Holy Land, and
the West were intertwined on a single day.

The author’s narrative suggests a total of 20 martyrs: two on an earlier day, and then
eight and ten martyrs on another occasion, for a total of 20 martyrs.

Some of the escapees located one another in the vicinity of Istahbánát
> and together proceeded towards the Rúníz village,342 which belonged to
> Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán and whose inhabitants were Baháʾís. The village
> Dhábit [chief ], Mír Muhammad-Hasan Nayrízí, was appointed by the
Afnán and for several days saw to the comfort of the refugees.

Suddenly, word reached them from Qaytás Khán, one of the inﬂuential
> men of Fasá, “I am commissioned on behalf of Shaykh Zakariyyá to come
> to the village of Rúníz, seizing [fugitive] Baháʾís, to send them forthwith
> before the Shaykh. As such, should any such person be at the village,
> you must see to their immediate exit so that you and I may not suﬀer
> problems and diﬃculties.” Apprehensive of the potential consequences,
> Mír Muhammad-Hasan, who for years had worked for the Afnán and
> served as the village chief, informed the hunted believers, “Qaytás Khán
> is a ruthless man and most likely would cause harassment. I suggest you
> prepare for departure towards Sarvistán.” The Baháʾís [not wishing to
bring diﬃculty on their host,] consented.

Even though their feet were severely injured from having sprinted [for
> many days] in the mountains and the wilderness, they recognized they
> had no choice but to ﬂee yet again. As such, forced by circumstances, [p.585]
with bleeding feet, they took to the desert.

They decided not to use the main road, as it might be frequented by
> ʿArab tribes and their cattle, and might cause them further trials. Led by
> a guide, they left in the direction of Kharman-Kúh. Still in the morning
> hours, however, the guide lost his way, and, deeply perplexed and con-
> founded, they knew not in which direction to proceed. On their way,
> they passed through areas where snowfall had accumulated in excess of ten
> meters, and they had to make their way deep in ice and snow. Despite all
> the adversities that had befallen them, constant expressions of gratitude to
> the court of their Beloved streamed forth from their lips. In that wretched
> state, in utmost humility and entreaty, they would raise their voices in
prayer to the Threshold of their compassionate God.

By noontime, due to extreme fatigue, none among them could take
> another step. They had no food or provisions, except a small quantity of
> ﬂour. Using the brushwood in the wild, a ﬁre was made and some snow-

The original word is qal ʿih, which technically means fort, but in local parlance

> which allowed them to make a few pieces of bread. Though there was so
very little, bread was eaten, and then they proceeded on their way yet again.

By dusk, the way [to Sarvistán] was found, and by darkness the village
> of ʿAlí-Ábád was reached. However, fearing the assailants, they decided
> to press on, and by mid-night they reached the forest in the vicinity of
> Sarvistán. [In the darkness,] they lost their way once more and failed
> to reach their destination that night. Fire was made, and they circled
> around it—some fell unconscious, while others remained awake due to
the piercing cold.

At break of dawn, they rose and recommenced their agonizing, tortuous
> march. The vast majority of their group were so bitterly tired, injured,
> and starved that they could hardly take steps. Most had to satisfy their
profound hunger with only leaves and wild bracken.

By noontime, their goal was within a half farsang of the village, and
> yet they were so extremely tired and famished that they could not travel
> this short distance. All fell to the ground unconscious, preferring death
> to such misery. Two among them, being younger and stronger than their
> peers, rose and, placing their trust in God, proceeded towards Sarvistán
where their Baháʾí brethren resided.

During those days, the teachers of the Cause of God, Áqá Mírzá
> ʿAlí-Akbar [Rafsinjání] and Áqá Mírzá Tarázuʾlláh [Samandarí] were in
> Sarvistán, and the friends were ﬁlled with joy and ecstasy. However, when
> an ʿArab messenger arrived from the [Rúníz] village belonging to the
> Afnán and informed them of what had transpired, their delight turned
> to bitter sorrow. Quickly they exerted themselves to gather all the neces-
> sary provisions so that upon the arrival of their wronged brethren, they
> might be welcomed beﬁttingly. It was then that the two young refugees
> arrived and informed them of the occurrences and the condition of the
remaining party.

Immediately, food and carriages were gathered and a large contingent
> of the friends taken to the spot where the persecuted believers had fallen
> unconscious. Seeing them in that state and at the door of death, the Sarv-
> istánís cried bitterly over the aﬄictions and hardships that these devoted
souls had endured. They were all fed and brought to Sarvistán.

I wish to note for the reader that from the dawn of the Faith until the
[p.590] present, the Baháʾís and the Muslims of Sarvistán have lived together like

brothers and in the utmost fraternity have associated with one another.343

The implication of this comment is that Shírází enemies perpetrated or instigated
the several earlier episodes of imprisonment of Sarvistánís or their martyrdom.

Return of Order

> Having noted the extensive harassment, disarray, molestation, and abuse
> brought about by Siyyid ʿAbduʾl-Husayn and Shaykh Zakariyyá, eventually
> Hájí Ásifuʾd-Dawlih [the governor-general] ordered [Mírzá Muhammad-

and Nayríz.

Proceeding with all due speed, Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí Khán, the
> Nasruʾd-Dawlih, ﬁrst arrived at Sarvistán and was briefed by the Nayrízí
> Baháʾís of the atrocities that had recently occurred. On hearing their report

“God willing, I will remedy the situation.”

In the company of the refugees, he then directed his camp towards

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

POLITICAL REFORMS AND UPHEAVALS OF 190910

Dismissal of the Ásifuʾd-Dawlih

> On hearing of the occurrences in Nayríz, the general disturbances in [p.595:3]
> Fárs, and the ineptness of the Ásifuʾd-Dawlih, the authorities in Tihrán
> decided to discharge Ásifuʾd-Dawlih from oﬃce and appoint a compe-
> tent, law-abiding person as the governor-general of Fárs. Therefore, they
> telegraphed the dismissal of Hájí Ásifuʾd-Dawlih, with the additional
> instruction for him to quickly depart for the capital, entrusting the aﬀairs
> of Fárs to Habíbuʾlláh Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk [who became the acting
> governor-general].

Baháʾís in the Administration of the Sahámuʾd-Dawlih

> After several months, Jaʿfar-Qulí Khán, the Sahámuʾd-Dawlih, was ap-
> pointed to the governorship of Fárs and on the 1 Shaʿbán AH 1327 [18
> August 1909], accompanied by only seven others, arrived at Shíráz. As he
> was an accomplished administrator, upon arrival he rolled up the remnant
> of the absolutists’ regime and allowed the constitutional monarchists to
> ﬂourish. He announced that whoever volunteered [as a civil servant],
> would be hired with suﬃcient salaries. Many people from diverse strata
> accepted, and among those registering were a number of believers, either
> known or unidentiﬁed [as Baháʾís]. Included in this group was the late
> Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Sádiq Khabbáz [the baker] who was particularly
> well known as a Baháʾí, and indeed his fame was on all tongues. Other
> believers were less known or were unidentiﬁed [as Baháʾís]. With no
exception, all were accepted for service.

Very quickly, in the [Governor’s] Ark, which was one of the build-
> ings from the era of the late Karím Khán Zand, various functions for
> a city-government were ﬁrmly established. One section of the building
> was set aside for the [civil] courts [and the judicial system]; another for
> the police; another for the municipality; and another for the military.
> The central building was designated for the provincial oﬃces. The work
> of the government began to unfold in an orderly fashion and in accord

> with the established laws, which everyone was obliged to follow. All peti-
> tions were reviewed [by the governor-general] and if deemed to be a legal
> issue, submitted to the judiciary for processing. The governor, however,
> closely scrutinized all operations, and if an agency was about to act with
> inequity and carry out an unjust decision, they were punished accord-
> ing to the percepts of the law. All levels of the administration were most
> cognizant of the need for careful expenditure of funds and had discarded
> the old practice of bribery and gifts. He also eﬀectively reorganized the
armed services.

The governor was particularly close to the two sons of the late Qavámuʾl-
> Mulk—Habíbuʾlláh Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk [IV],346 and Mírzá Muham-
> mad-ʿAlí Khán, the Nasruʾd-Dawlih—and showed them much attention
> and consideration. He entrusted the former with the police and security
> forces,347 while Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí, the Nasruʾd-Dawlih, was prized and
> placed in charge of the military forces, with the title of Amír-Tumání.348
> The governor personally supervised the payment of monthly salaries to
> military personnel and ensured that payment was delivered properly on
the ﬁrst of each month.

The justice of the governor became renowned throughout the province
> of Fárs. In accordance with both religious law as well as civil ordinances,
> each crime or treachery had a speciﬁc code of punishment. Those having
> committed unseemly acts, after having their guilt proven, and upon the
> ruling of the court, would be forced to wear a colorful, paper hat, with
> bells hanging on the sides, and in such a [humiliating] condition, they
> would be lashed publicly. In one instance, a woman had committed thiev-
> ery and after the court had pronounced against her, in accord with the
> quranic law, “As to the thief, male or female, cut oﬀ his or her hands,”349
[p.600] four of her left ﬁngers were severed on the public square. Such incidents

> served to ensure complete order throughout the region, and none dared
> being presumptuous towards others.

For a biography see Bámdád, Sharh Hál Rijál Iran, vol. 1, pp. 310–11.

The text lists the following oﬃces: Kalántar, Bíglar-Baykí, and the Nazmiyyih, which
are respectively the chief of police, the district administrator and the security forces.

The implication being that during the interim period, the powerful Qavám family
> had emerged as supporters of constitutional reform. This enabled them to regain their
previous prestige and inﬂuence.

political reforms and upheavals of –                           219

Opposition to the Sahámuʾd-Dawlih

> Aﬀairs progressed splendidly for six months, and all segments of society
> enjoyed tranquility and comfort. This peace and quiet, however, provoked
> certain mischievous elements350 to precipitate diﬃculties. From the begin-
> ning of the month of Dhiʾl-Hijjih [December 1909], crowds of worshipers
began to march in the streets.351

On 1 Muharram AH 1328 [13 January 1910], taʿziyyih commemora-
> tions were launched, and troubles were afoot. The rabble began provoca-
> tion, and the wanton women and lewd youngsters joined in the incitement.
> They marched in the streets and the bazaar and in the name of mourning
> [for the Imám Husayn] would level insults and slanders. The esteemed
> divines organized many congregations in various homes and placed certain
> ignoramuses in charge of each, tasked with directly or through allusions
> criticizing the administration’s reforms. Their intent was to underscore
> their opposition by insinuating that the governor [and his administration]
> had acted against the religious precepts and that the newly established
> government oﬃces were incompatible with Islamic teachings and its sacred
> jurisprudence. They exerted themselves in demonstrating that indeed the
> real purpose of these civil improvements lay elsewhere and was inspired
by other designs.352

They further insisted that matters of law must be decided in the reli-
> gious courts by the illustrious divines, not by the existing judicial system.
> Moreover, the opposition maintained, “The oﬃcials of the administration
> are members of the wayward and perverse community [i.e., the Baháʾís],
> and the governor has appointed Bábís to all such ranks. Such a government
> is harmful to the province of Fárs and must immediately and completely
> be aborted. Further, why do we need modernized police? Security must
> be maintained as before through Kalántars and Bíglar-Baykís, and admin-
> istered by the Dárúghihs and the local Kad-Khudás!”

[Mírzá Habíbuʾlláhʾs narrative ends at this point.]

Presumably, a reference to the absolute monarchists.

Political demonstrations in Iran are typically disguised as religious events, par-
> ticularly associated with the martyrdom of Imám Husayn, which is commemorated in
Muharram.

The author’s intent seems to be that the clerical opposition was implying European
regimes had inspired the reforms.

The Governorship of the Sahámuʾd-Dawlih

> Subsequent to his triumphant return to Shíráz, the Nasruʾd-Dawlih joined
> hands with his brother, Habíbuʾlláh Khán, the Qavámuʾl-Mulk IV, in order
> to create tumult resulting in the abdication of the governor-general, the
> Sahámuʾd-Dawlih, and forcing the latter to quit the city. For this purpose,
> the two Qavám brothers succeeded in winning over the ʿulamá to their
> purpose and incited the leading mujtahids to create the conditions for a
> popular uproar. The ʿulamá were more than happy to comply with this
> request and reckoned that they could hit two birds with one stone, namely,
> to evict [a liberal] governor from his post and to uproot the Baháʾís. As
> such, in no time they noised abroad that the Sahámuʾd-Dawlih was a
> member of the wayward sect [i.e., Baháʾí Faith] and that he received all
> his instructions from the leadership of that community. Once again, the
> old method of using Baháʾís as the scapegoat and the raison d’être for
> the commotion proved most beneﬁcial, and the name Bábí was made the
currency of the upheaval.

Led by youngsters and ruﬃans, the streets were ﬁlled with demonstra-
> tors who shouted obscenities against the governor and the Baháʾí Faith.
> They had decided in secret that the most opportune time to bring their
> revolt to fruition was the day of ʿAshurá and had prepared intensely for
> that event. Their chief strategy was for the leaders of diﬀerent districts
> and neighborhoods to direct their march against the residence of Baháʾís,
> with the crowning goal of destroying and plundering these homes. In this
> regard, they had particularly targeted the Blessed House of the Báb.

On the eve before this occurrence, Áqá Mírzá Áqá Hakím [known as
> Faríd] was in the upper chamber of the Blessed House of the Báb reciting
> [Baháʾuʾlláh’s] Visitation Tablet for the Prince of Martyrs [Imám Husayn]
> when persistent knocks were heard on the main entrance. Upon open-
> ing the door it was found that the visitor was Mírzá Mihdí Bávanátí—a
> staunch believer—who informed us that when he was passing through the
> city’s Saʿdí Gate he had come upon a procession of mourners. From the
> leader of this group he had learned that on the day of commemoration
> of Imám Husayn’s martyrdom [22 January 1910], in the course of their
> procession, the myrmidons of the Kázirún and Saʿdí districts, along with
> the rabble of Kúshk ʿAbbás-ʿAlí and Tal-Khidash, planned to attack and
demolish the House of the Báb.

As soon as my father, Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh, heard this news, he sent
> Áqá Mírzá Áqá [Faríd] to apprise the Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih<99> of the
> situation. In turn, the latter wrote a letter for the attention of Mírzá
> Muhammad-Báqir Khán Dihqán and sent it through the same messen-
> ger. Upon becoming acquainted with the details, that very night Dihqán
> wrote to the Qavámuʾl-Mulk [IV] and his brother, the Nasruʾd-Dawlih,
> informing them that rumors suggested that various religious leaders
> premeditated the destruction of the House of the Báb. In this letter, he
> asked the powerful Qavám brothers to prevent the occurrence of this
> opprobrious and contemptible deed. Dihqán’s attendant, a certain Yúsuf,
> carried this missive to the Qavámuʾl-Mulk’s residence, but he learned that
> the two brothers had gone to the orchards at ʿAﬁf-Ábád. As the situation
> was most treacherous, Yúsuf proceeded after them to their vacation spot
and delivered his charge.

Deeply perturbed by the turn of events, that very night the two Qavám
> brothers returned to Shíráz and immediately summoned the leaders of
> the aforementioned districts. In no uncertain terms, the chieftains were
> told, “Our sole intention was to force the departure of [the governor]
> the Sahámuʾd-Dawlih, and not a general assault on the homes of inno-
> cent people and the pillage of their properties!” They exacted from the
> assembled leaders a solemn assurance that none would commit atrocities
against the Baháʾí Faith.

At the hour of dawn the following day, the Nasruʾd-Dawlih, in the
> company of cavalry and foot soldiers, came to the district where Sháh-
> Chiráq, Masjid Naw, and the Jewish quarter were situated—the neigh-
> borhood where the House of the Báb was located. By a show of force,
> he wanted to make certain that law and order were maintained and
> that none dared to be presumptuous towards the Blessed House of the

> Báb. He spent the day in the district and took his lunch at the honored
> Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih’s home, which was situated in close proximity to the
Masjid Naw and the House of the Báb.

Soon, processions from the various townships and villages arrived in
> Shíráz, armed with shovels and pickaxes, and determined to do harm.
> However, to their astonishment, they found their designs against the Baháʾí
> Faith thoroughly frustrated. It was the eﬃciency and the wisdom of the
> Qavámuʾl-Mulk and the Nasruʾd-Dawlih, as well as the resolute act of
> Dihqán and the Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih that prevented riots and protected
the Blessed House of the Báb.

Not long after, the Sahámuʾd-Dawlih was dismissed from oﬃce, and
> Ridá-Qulí Khán, the Sálár-Muʿazam, who later came to be known as the
> Nizámu’s-Saltanih II, was appointed as the governor-general of Fárs.

The Governorship of the Sálár-Muʿazam, until AH 1330 [1912]

> Before coming to Shíráz, [Ridá-Qulí Khán] the Sardár-Muʿazam353 served
> as the governor-general of Kirmánsháh, and his political proclivities
> inclined him toward German policies. In the company of a number of
> nationalists who were deeply against the British imperialist involvement in
> Iran, he came to Burázján by way of Bihbahán. His intention was to join
> forces with [Ismáʿíl Khán,] the Sawlatuʾd-Dawlih [Qashqáʾí] and to form
> a sovereign rule in the southern region of Iran, completely independent
> of Tihrán’s control. He determined that the main obstacle in achieving his
> goal was the presence of the Qavámuʾl-Mulk, the Nasruʾd-Dawlih, Mírzá
> Muhammad-Báqir Khán Dihqán, and a few others. As such, he decided
to remove these personages from the scene.

It was during this time that Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán was sum-
> moned by ʿAbduʾl-Bahá to the Holy Land. Though he personally wished
> to obey the Master’s instruction, nevertheless, he consulted with the
> Qavámuʾl-Mulk. Considering all the commotion that surrounded them
> as result of the anticipated threats directed by the new governor and the
> fact that Dihqán’s presence was critical to the Qavám’s operations, the
> latter persuaded Dihqán to postpone this journey and advised against it.

However, it was then that a cable was received by Bashíru’s-Sultán from

Various sources refer to him alternatively as either the Sálár-Muʿazam or Sardár-
Muʿazam.

> ʿAbduʾl-Bahá, which read, “Shíráz Bashiru’s-Sultán. Immediately dispatch
the director of the Post Oﬃce, Muhammad-Baqir Khan.”

Instantly, the Bashíru’s-Sultán went to Dihqán’s residence and presented
> him with the text of this telegraph, adding, “You must leave [for Haifa] at
> once! No one knows what wisdom lies concealed in the Master’s instruc-
tion, and it behooves you to faithfully obey.”

This time, Mírzá [Muhammad-] Báqir Khán did not discuss the matter
> with anyone, and within twelve hours he left Shíráz for Búshihr that very
> night. In Burázján he happened to come upon the camp of the Nizámu’s-
> Saltanih and the Sawlatuʾd-Dawlih. The latter advised the governor to
> arrest Dihqán, but rejecting this plea, he responded, “If we were to seize
> him, the Qavám brothers would become aware of our plans for subduing
> them upon reaching Shíráz, which is our primary objective, and its execu-
> tion would become an insurmountable task. Further, Dihqán is leaving
> the country at the present and is no threat to our purposes. When the
> Qaváms have been removed from the scene, then Dihqan is insigniﬁcant.
> Therefore, it is best to allow him leave quietly.” As such, Dihqán was saved
> and quickly left Iran, and it was then that the wisdom of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s
emphatic instruction for his immediate departure became evident.354

In short, Dihqán proceeded to the Holy land and met the Greatest
> Holy Leaf [in Haifa]. Afterwards, he left for Paris where he attained the
> presence of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá. When the region presented him no further
> threats, he returned to Shíráz during the First World War after an absence
of some four or ﬁve years.

The arrival of the Sálár-Muʿazam, accompanied by the Sawlatuʾd-Dawlih
> and one thousand Qashqáʾí cavalry, caused enormous chaos and disorder
> in Shíráz.355 Soon, disorder and disturbances spread to the surrounding
> towns and villages in Fárs. The new governor arrested the Qavám brothers
> and banished them to Europe. However, en route, the Nasruʾd-Dawlih
> was slain at the hand of the Qashqáʾí tribesmen,356 but his older brother,
> Habíbuʾlláh Khán, escaped through an unfrequented road and succeeded in
> reaching the British Embassy, where he sought and received protection.

See Muʾayyad, Khátirát Habíb, vol. 1, pp. 89–90, or its translation in Rabbani, Eight
Years Near ʿAbduʾl-Bahá, chapter 3, where Dihqán’s safe arrival at Beirut is reported.

According to his biography in Bámdád, Sharh Hál Rijál Iran, vol. 2, pp. 31–34,
> Ridá-Qulí Khán (AH 1286–1343/AD1869–1924) was the governor of Fárs from 1329
to the beginning of AH 1330 [circa December 1911].

The Sawlatuʾd-Dawlih was the chief of the Qashqáʾí tribe, and this assassination
took place at his instigation.

Shaykh released Siyyid Asaduʾlláh to the custody of the oﬃcial.

The following evening, the Farmán-Farmá summoned Siyyid Asaduʾlláh
> to his oﬃce and released him to Mírzá Fadluʾlláh Khán. He further advised

> Through the collective eﬀort of Sulaymán Shakybá of Isfahán, Mírzá
> Fadluʾlláh Khán Afnán<171>, and Mírzá Munír Nabílzádih, Dr.
> Muhammad-Báqir Húshyár was brought to the shore of certitude. From
> the very beginning, he set out to teach the Faith of God with indescrib-
> able zeal and unmatched audacity and courage. Soon, he decided on the
> conversion of Shaykh Jaʿfar Mahallátí. He took a copy of the Kitáb-i
> Íqán for the mujtahid and asked him to produce convincing reply that
> would suﬃciently reject the claim of the Baháʾís. He added, “The more
> I consider the contents of this Book, the more evident it is that every
> word of it is consistent with the Qurʾán and the Islamic Traditions. As
> such, I personally see no room for refutation. However, I would like to
have you consider the matter attentively.”

Wise to his intent, the Shaykh caused a huge uproar and ordered his
> immediate bastinado. Afterwards, Dr. Húshyár was sent to the police,
> while outside the building a large demonstration by the unruly elements
> was organized by the Shaykh. Once more, Mírzá Fadluʾlláh Khán Banán
> appealed to the Farmán-Farmá for assistance and rescue. The governor
> instructed the police commissioner, Hájí Masʿuduʾd-Dawlih, that, should
> Mírzá Fadluʾlláh Khán come to the magistrates, to comply with his
> requests. Banán went to the police headquarters and asked to speak with
> Dr. Húshyár, who had been brought in earlier. Upon entering the oﬃce
> of the police chief, Banán said, “This man will be my guest this evening
> and tomorrow, and I will deliver him to your charge on Saturday.”

In such wise, Húshyár was released from conﬁnement and led to Ustád

The Governorship of the Nusratuʾd-Dawlih

his reign that were related to the Baháʾí Faith:

> The ﬁrst event stemmed from the severe beating and viliﬁcation that Mírzá
> Nasru’lláh Khán Ázádigan of Jahrum received in the Bazaar Vakíl, and the
details are as follows:

One day when Mírzá Nasru’lláh Khán was on his way to work in the post
> oﬃce, one of the assistants in a cloth-dealer’s shop made certain slanderous
> remarks about his [Bahá’í] beliefs that he ventured to answer. As such, a
> number of shopkeepers attacked him with crowbars, scissors, and metallic
> rulers. After some time, he succeeded in freeing himself and, bloody and
covered in injuries, gained his way back to the post oﬃce.

This event was immediately reported to Prince Muhammad-Ridá Mírzá,
> the Muqarrib, a staunch and devoted Bahá’í who directed the powerful post
> oﬃce. On hearing the details, he ordered the immediate suspension of the
> postal system of the province, which was to remain in eﬀect until such time

> respect and mutual support, the director of the telegraph oﬃce also closed
> the doors to his agency and announced that work will be resumed only after
the aﬀairs in the post oﬃce had come to amicable resolution.

The strike at these two critical agencies caused total disruption in the
> province and among the people, particularly for the merchants of the
> Bazaar who depended on the constant ﬂow of communication for their
> daily livelihood and who were beginning to feel its grievous consequences.
> This action was also viewed most seriously in Tihrán, as all communication

> and merchants repeatedly appealed to the governor to intervene and ﬁnd a
> solution to this impasse, rectifying matters so that the two [Baháʾí] directors
would resume work.

In response to this public outcry, the Nusratuʾd-Dawlih summoned
> Prince Muqarrib into his presence and asked him in what way could the
> matter be redressed and justice be served so that the postal work could be
> continued. The Prince replied that the person who had committed these
> slanderous remarks in the ﬁrst place and had caused the beating of Jahrumí,
> worked in the Bazaar Vakíl, and he was to be subjected to the bastinado
> in public so that all would recognize that henceforth none were allowed to
> treat government employees disrespectfully. His overture was immediately
accepted and an order issued for the arrest of the villain.

The following day, in the presence of a multitude that included the gov-
> ernor, the heads of all the governmental oﬃces, the merchants, and ordinary
> residents, the prisoner was brought to the city’s central square, known as
> the Maydán Túp-Khánih. As the bastinado was being applied to his feet
> and legs, he pleaded strenuously for mercy, but Prince Muqarrib instructed
> a more severe beating. The captive then cried out for mercy in the name of
> the Monarch and the Throne, but unmoved, the Muqarrib ordered yet more
> intense beating. The condemned, weeping in great pain, cried out for mercy
> in the name of the Prophet Muhammad, the Qurʾán, and the Holy Imáms,
> but it was to no avail, as the Prince would only instruct further beating.
> Finally, the captive, twisting in excruciating pain, cried out, “For the sake of
> ʿAbbás Eﬀendi accept my repentance!” And as soon as he uttered the name
> of the Master, the Muqarrib placed his cane on the bastinado, signaling the
> farrashes to stop beating. As such, the man was pardoned publicly in the
> name of ʿAbdu’l-Bahá, and that tumult came to an end.

> The second event occurred when the news of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s ascension
arrived in Shíráz. My father used to related the details thus:

> The telegram of the Greatest Holy Leaf from the Holy Land was delivered
> conﬁdentially to Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán Dihqán361 by Ghulám-ʿAlí

> ʿAlí-Muhammad Baig, Dihqán invited the members of the Spiritual Assembly
> to a meeting that very day at his home. He had asked Áqá Muhammad-
> Hasan ʿAhdiyyih to inform me [i.e., Mírzá Habíb] and my brother Mírzá
> Buzurg of this meeting. ʿAhdiyyih came to our house and said that it must
> be a matter of great import because Dihqán invited us at such an early hour.
We left instantly, and Áqá Mírzá Áqá Faríd also joined us en route.

During that period, through hypocrisy and conniving, ʿAbduʾl-Husayn
> Taríqatí had managed to get elected to the Spiritual Assembly even though he
> was one of the principals in the Itihád Islámí Society. Constantly, he leaked
> news of the community and of the consultations of the Spiritual Assembly
> to his comrades. Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán was deeply suspicious of
> him and had expressed the hope that the friends would not re-elect him,
but on that day, he was still a member of our Spiritual Assembly.

When we arrived at Dihqán’s residence, we immediately discerned from
> his downcast condition and reddened eyes that the news perturbing him
> so profoundly must be none other than the ascension of our Beloved. In
> response to our inquiry about communications from the Holy Land, in a
> voice ﬁlled with sorrow, he read to us the telegram from the Greatest Holy
> Leaf. The state of anguish and distress that overcame each one of us is truly
> indescribable. Deeply shaken by the news, our sorrow and grief knew no
> bounds. In an instant, all His loving memories, His brilliant visage, His
> heavenly tones, everything that had made Him more precious than life itself,
passed before my eyes. How could life go on without Him?

While each one was expressing his sincerely felt loss, Taríqatí, however,
> was displaying unusual distress, quite foreign to a Baháʾí way of bereavement
> and Baháʾí dignity. This hypocritical sanctimoniousness at such a momentous
> time deeply angered Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán. He asked Taríqatí to
> withhold such unseemly demonstrations, stating, “Now is not the time for
> mourning in such manner, as we must think of ways to save and protect
> the community from the injuries aimed at it by unrelenting enemies. Of
> a certainty, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá must have appointed a worthy successor for the
> preservation and the guardianship of the one true Faith of God. We have
> to wait until instructions are received from the Holy Land.” He further
> suggested that this matter be kept conﬁdential until such time as we could
> wisely announce His passing together with the news of His succession.
> Moreover, Dihqán emphasized, “Care must be exercised that this news does
> not reach the enemies of the Faith who would ﬁnd it an opportune time to
> once again cause disturbances and to harm the believers.” Everyone readily
agreed with these prudent measures.

Immediately after the meeting, however, Taríqatí, who at the time was
> a superintendent at the post oﬃce, made this news known to the Itihád
> Islámí, and the next day the city was ﬁlled with the cry, “The God of the
> Bábís is dead!” Under such circumstances, the clergy, especially Shaykh Jaʿfar
> Mahallátí, Mullá Hasan Qannád, Shaykh Murtidá, and Siyyid Muhammad
> Faly, who were inﬂuential and served as the marjaʿ taqlíd [i.e., the Shiʿites’
> source of emulation], saw a perfect opportunity to commence disturbances
> and to attain their long-cherished goal of the destruction of Baháʾí Holy
> Places, particularly, the House of the Báb. Also, on their mind was pillage

> of the business oﬃce of Muhammad-Hasan ʿAhdiyyih and the residence
of Dihqán.

When their intentions were noised through the people in the streets and
> the bazaars, we became aware of it as well. Members of the Spiritual Assembly
> gathered in the oﬃce of Áqá Muhammad-Hasan ʿAhdiyyih for an emergency
> consultation, and we all were bewildered as to how this news had leaked
> outside the community. The Spiritual Assembly decided to have Dihqán and
I consult [privately] on this matter and put forward a proposal.

Dihqán was a very kind and considerate man, but when he perceived
> an issue against the good of the Spiritual Assembly, then he would become
> visibly agitated and was prone to ﬁts of anger. I was chosen for this consulta-
> tion partly because he observed utmost regards towards me. When the two
> of us sat down to discuss the situation, he began by shouting, “I have said
> over and over that Taríqatí is a conniving liar and is nothing but a cheap
> informer for the enemies of the Faith. Yet, the Spiritual Assembly is so gull-
> ible that it allows him to attend the meetings and to spy on our aﬀairs!”
> He paused for a minute and then asked, “Where are the other members
> of the Spiritual Assembly?” “They are gathered in the oﬃce of ʿAhdiyyih,”
> I replied. He thought again and said, “Notify them to come to my house
[for a meeting] and be sure to tell Taríqatí as well.”

Within a short time, they all arrived. When everyone was present, Dihqán
> powerfully addressed the Spiritual Assembly in these words, “I had imagined
> that this Spiritual Assembly, when asked, was capable of keeping matters
> conﬁdential and had not realized that some members were such impostors
> that they would take the decisions to outsiders.” He continued to speak with
> much heat and anger, “Although the Spiritual Assembly had decided that for
> the time being it must emphatically keep the news of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s ascen-
> sion conﬁdential, yet that news has spread throughout the city. The mullás
> are now busy planning sedition and injury to the Baháʾís. However, this
> time they have grievously miscalculated! This is because after ʿAbduʾl-Bahá,
> I no longer wish to live. I will dedicate all my [considerable] possessions to
> combating the mullás and to exacting a revenge for eighty years of wrong
> that these contemptible jurists have perpetrated against the innocent believ-
> ers! ʿAbduʾl-Bahá is no longer in this world to bridle the aﬀairs of the Faith
> and to control its members through such admonishments as, ‘It behoveth
> us to kiss the hand of the would-be assassin and to set out, dancing, on
> our way to the habitation of the Friend.ʾ362 Now that with their custom-
> ary treachery and deceit, the ʿulamá have set out to destroy the Baháʾí
> community and to plunder my house, I will not sit quietly. I will avenge
> the past and will ensure that whosoever leaked this matter to our enemies
> receives the just chastisement that he deserves! Rest assured that I intend
to spill much blood!”

He then asked the Spiritual Assembly’s secretary, Áqá Mírzá Fadluʾlláh, the
Hakím-Banán, to send a message on his behalf to all the [Baháʾí] chieftains

> of various villages that they at once send to Shíráz all available riﬂemen
> under their command. Dihqán also wrote to the following: Mullá Husayn
> Khán, the Kad-Khudá of Qallát; Mullá ʿAlí Áqá, the Kad-Khudá of Zákhird;
> the Kalántar and Kad-Khudás of Marv-Dasht, such as Fadl-ʿAlí Khán and
> others; and Mírzá Husayn-ʿAlí Khán, the Kalántar of Sarvistán. To all of
> these men, he emphatically conveyed his instructions to send their gunmen
> immediately to Shíráz. Having signed and sealed these directives, he ordered
> his attendants to deliver the communications and went so far to tell the
> one destined for Sarvistán to convey it with the greatest haste. Of course,
> he was stating all his commands in the most heightened and angered voice,
accompanied with repeated poundings of his ﬁst on the table.

Having completed these tasks, he then addressed the Spiritual Assembly
> with the same wrath, “The existence of a Spiritual Assembly that cannot
> protect its own discussions is of no use. Indeed, not having one is bet-
> ter than having one. Given the situation, I no longer need a secretary or
> advisors, and hereby [as the Spiritual Assembly’s chairman] dissolve this
> Spiritual Assembly.”363 With this comment, he dismissed everyone, but
kept me behind.

After the other members of the Spiritual Assembly left his residence, he
> said to me, “I meant no disrespect toward any of the Spiritual Assembly
> members, as my sole purpose was to make it known to this miserable
> hypocrite [i.e., Taríqatí] that we are aware of his two-faced activities and to
> force his departure from the Spiritual Assembly. Kindly convey my heartfelt
> apologies to other members of the Spiritual Assembly and tell them that as
needs arise, I am at their immediate disposal.”

Having realized that he had been discovered and that through Dihqán’s
> determination his life was in great peril, Taríqatí went directly to the head-
> quarters of Itihád Islámí and with much embellishment informed its members
> of all that had transpired in Dihqán’s home. He informed the mullás, “Within
> twenty-four hours, at least two thousand riﬂemen will arrive in Shíráz for
> the purpose of slaughtering all the ecclesiastics, members of Itihád Islámí,
> and anyone who has previously opposed the Baháʾís. Therefore, it is best that
> for now we postpone our plans for the elimination of these wayward people
> and wait for another opportune moment. Otherwise, there is every chance
> that we would suﬀer mercilessly in the ensuing battles.” Hearing this report
> and learning of Dihqán’s resolution to use his vast inﬂuence and wealth to
> confront them particularly frightened the ʿulamá, and in no time they had
collectively decided to remain quiet and see what was in store.

Next morning, nineteen Baháʾí riﬂemen from the village of Qallát arrived
in Shíráz. Dihqán instructed them to disperse in the city and purchase

their ranks.

The city’s inhabitants conveyed the news of the occurrences to the ʿulamá,

Continued Agitation of Itihád Islámí Society

> Notwithstanding the oath taken by the ʿulamá to leave the Baháʾís alone,
> the Itihád Islámí did not desist from its activities [against the Baháʾí Faith]
> and never missed an opportunity to insult or injure the believers. In this

> Mírzá Munír Nabílzádeh364 where this devoted and enthusiastic teacher
> spoke. The news of these meetings and the zeal of Nabílzádih constantly
> induced the members of the Itihád Islámí to protestation and machina-
> tion. Led by Kázirúní, they endeavored to raise a popular revolt in the
> bazaar against the believers.

One of the foremost teachers of the Baháʾí Faith, Nabílzádih had come to Shíráz some
time earlier and regularly held very popular ﬁresides meetings at his own residence.

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 236                                                                                  7/10/2008 2:44:12 PM

In those days a group of ardent Baháʾí young men, such as ʿAbduʾl-
> Husayn Satarí, ʿAbduʾlláh Madaraʾí, Sulaymán Shakíbá,365 Fathuʾlláh
> Afnán, Nusratuʾlláh Badrí-Afnán, Siyyid Abúʾl-Qásim Páyandih, and a
> few others would gather every night at the Khál Aʿzam’s house, one of
> the Baháʾí endowments. Previously, they had served for many years in the
> South Persian Regiment and as such were well familiar with the use of
> weapons. They spent their time planning armed attacks on various groups
> of opponents of the Faith. Repeatedly, Mírzá Munír admonished them as
> to the folly of their designs, noting that were they actually to implement
> their plans, this could bring complete ruin upon the Baháʾís of Shíráz and
> could potentially endanger the entire Baháʾí community of Iran. Though
> these young men were generally not impressed by Nabílzádih’s appeal for
> paciﬁsm, he had, however, managed to exact a promise that they would
consult the Spiritual Assembly before taking any steps.
Áqá Mírzá Munír related to the author [i.e., A.Q. Afnán] the following:

> Realizing the gravity of the situation, I went to the Spiritual Assembly meet-
> ing, which was taking place in the house of Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí Khán
> Dihqán, and related the story and the plan of the young men. I further
> left my own pistol on the table round which the Spiritual Assembly had
> gathered. After their deliberation, the Spiritual Assembly decided to send
> your father [i.e., Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh] and me to the house of the Khál to
ﬁnd a way to disarm and disperse these believers.

About two hours into the night we arrived at the house of the martyred-
> uncle and with the utmost respect spoke to the honored gentlemen, “There
> is no question that generation after generation, Baháʾís in every village,
> every town, and every corner in this land have been made the target of
> the most brutal tyranny and the torment of the ungodly. In addition, it
> is indubitable that the blood of countless martyrs and innocent men and
> women has reddened every inch of Iran’s soil. Nor is anyone denying the
> pain and the suﬀering that multitudes of families must endure for a great
> many years after they have lost their loved ones. However, were an armed
> aggression to be initiated by someone in Shíráz, you can rest assured that the
> entire country will be engulfed in a massive holocaust of Baháʾí-killing. Do
> you really imagine that a city or town would be left where a single believer
> can reside or remain standing? Nay, if this powder were lit, it would most
> assuredly explode in our own hands and can never be extinguished. The
> only way to survival for this community is to remain paciﬁst, as enjoined
> upon us by the Blessed Perfection. Otherwise, in an instant, we would be
obliterated.”

For a while we spoke and reasoned in such manner, and this helped some
to grow acquiescent, but a few remained wedded to their militant views.

For a biography, see Sulaymání, Masábih Hidáyat, vol. 9, pp. 123–94.

> Finally, your father [i.e., Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh] calmly said to them, “I have
> been commissioned by the Spiritual Assembly to conﬁscate your guns and
> ammunition. You have no alternative but to obey the Assembly’s wish.” All

Dissemination of the Will and Testament of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá

> My father used to relate that the Master’s Will and Testament was ﬁrst
> unveiled at a commemorative meeting that took place at the home of
> Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí Khán Dihqán. My father read to the assembled
> friends the ﬁrst half of the Will, and the second half was recited by
> ʿAbduʾl-Husayn Khán Dihqán, who had just arrived from Beirut. When
> the reading of the Text was concluded, Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán
> prostrated himself on the ground and then raised his hands in thankful-
> ness to ʿAbduʾl-Bahá, saying, “Shoghi Eﬀendi is related to the Twin Holy
> Trees and is of the Holy Lineage. We all bow in obedience before him;
> we all render thanks unto him; we all show humility before him; we all
> believe and rely on him; and we all stand assured and conﬁdent because
> of him. We verily testify that ʿAbduʾl-Bahá is the all-knowing protector
> of this community, and none was nearer to Him or loved more dearly
> by Him than Shoghi Eﬀendi. Before the sovereign will of Shoghi Eﬀendi
we prostrate ourselves in submissiveness.”

This expression of humility and obedience by Dihqán, coupled with
> his act of prostration in thankfulness, had a profound eﬀect on the
> friends, and tears of joy and happiness were shed on that day. That day,
> once more Baháʾuʾlláh worked His miracle, and our sorrow for the loss
> of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá was transmuted into joy of bliss, celebrating the person
of Shoghi Eﬀendi.

Unanimously, the gathering decided to write a letter to the presence
> of the beloved Guardian expressing the community’s servitude unto his
> threshold.

> in the year 1305 Sh366 [1926]. One of the factions consisted of the fol-
> lowers of [Ismáʿil Khán] Sawlatuʾd-Dawlih, the chief of Qashqáʾí tribe,
> who harbored ambitions for national oﬃce.367 His supporters launched a
> massive political campaign in Jahrum that triggered a huge uproar, creat-
> ing a charged atmosphere that led to conditions ripe for the persecution
of Baháʾís.

In those days Mírzá Lutf-ʿAlí Khán, the Mudyruʾd-Dawlih, was the
> governor of Jahrum, while Akbar Mírzá, the Sarimuʾd-Dawlih, was the
> governor-general of Fárs and Amír-Lashkar Mahmúd Ayram held the post
> of military commander of Fárs. The followers of the Sawlatuʾd-Dawlih in
> Jahrum were such individuals as Siyyid ʿAlí [Píshnámz],368 Karbaláʾí Siyyid
> Habíb Jahrumí, Siyyid ʿAlí Muʿizz, and his brother Siyyid Muhammad-Sadr
> Qadr-Qadr. To divert attention from their fraud, they started an intense,
> brutal persecution of the friends, and in the process eight Baháʾís were
> martyred.369 These innocent souls were slain in the most barbaric manner
imaginable through stabbing, beating, and stoning.370

A written report of the parlous incident was sent to the Sarimuʾd-
> Dawlih and his military commander, General Mahmúd Ayram. Tihrán
> was also made fully aware of these details and a report presented to Reza
> Sháh, the new sovereign, who ordered an immediate thorough investiga-
> tion. From Shíráz, Major General Sultán Sayfuʾlláh Himat was charged to
> proceed to Jahrum to carry out the monarch’s directive and to prosecute
the oﬀending individuals.

Over the years on many occasions, the present author has heard Major
General Himat describe his eﬀorts in these words:

> After the governor communicated the orders to me, thirty soldiers were
> placed at my disposal for this mission. When we arrived in Jahrum, I
> immediately moved to arrest several of the Baháʾís, thereby winning the
> conﬁdence of the local Muslims. I then began my investigation and after
> two days discovered the identity of the criminal elements who had commit-
> ted these reprehensible oﬀenses. Instantly, orders were issued for their arrest,

Sh stands for Shamsí, which is a solar-based calendar used mostly in Iran.

At the time, he was a parliamentarian from Jahrum, but the tide of the election
was going against him; therefore, he resorted to cheating.

He was the son and the successor of Siyyid ʿAbduʾl-Husayn Lárí, the instigator of
the Baháʾí persecutions of 1909 in Nayríz.

The eight Baháʾí martyrs were: Siyyid Husayn Ruhání; Ustád ʿAbbás; Muhammad-
> Kázim; Muhammad-Hasan; Muhammad-Shafíʿ; Mashhadí ʿAbbás; Ustád Muhammad-
Hasan; and Muhammad-Ridá.

Religions 1844–1944, pp. 465–72.

> and every day they were publicly subjected to bastinado. I also immediately
> freed the Baháʾí prisoners and oﬀered them my deepest apologies. A message
> was sent to Siyyid Muhammad that should he interfere in my aﬀairs, he
> too would be arrested and publicly chastised. In this manner, the upheaval
> in Jahrum abated.

> Because of the intense persecution of the believers and the martyrdom
> of Baháʾís in that city, the Spiritual Assembly of Jahrum was dissolved.
> However, in the same year, a communication was received from the beloved
> Guardian who showered his loving benevolence on the much-wronged
> believers of Jahrum and encouraged them to remain undaunted and to
> resume their activities. He further instructed the Spiritual Assembly of
> Shíráz to assist in the reconstitution of the Jahrum Spiritual Assembly.
> For this purpose, the Spiritual Assembly asked my father to proceed to
> Jahrum and prepare the community for the re-election of the Spiritual
> Assembly. Toward the latter part of Bahman [circa mid-February 1927]
> my father went to Jahrum, and during the forty days of his stay, Baháʾí
> activities were re-initiated, the Spiritual Assembly was formed, and various
committees re-appointed.

The ﬁre of this ordeal, though most painful and intense, served to gal-
> vanize the believers into one uniﬁed whole and propelled them forward

Hasan Balyúzí in Shíráz

> In the summer of 1309 Sh [1930], my deeply loved cousin [later, Hand
> of the Cause] Hasan Múvaqqar Balyúzí, arrived in Shíráz from Beirut
> for the purpose of visiting his family. Greatly excited at the prospect,
> the Baháʾí Youth Committee warmly welcomed him and invited him to
> speak at a gathering of the friends on the next Friday night. The main
> themes of his presentation were to be: the diﬀusion of the Cause in the
> West, the tidings from the Holy Land, and the Beirut students’ visit to
> the presence of the beloved Guardian. The Youth Committee capitalized
> on this opportunity and invited the whole community, young and old
alike, to this historic gathering.

In those days all Baháʾí activities were conducted in Hájí Mírzá Siyyid
> ʿAlí, the Khál Aʿzam’s house, which was designated by ʿAbduʾl-Bahá as
> a Mashriquʾl-Adhkár. The honored Fádil Yazdí and Fádil Tihrání both
> resided there as well, and thus the comings and goings to the building
> never ceased. This house was in the vicinity of Sháh-Chiráq and Masjid

> Naw, as well as being in the proximity of another Baháʾí Holy Place, that
> is, the house where the Báb was born. After the passing of the wife of the
> martyred-uncle, the heir had illegitimately conﬁscated this residence and
> later had sold it to Siyyid Muhammad Qálí-Furúsh [the carpet-seller],
> who numbered among the most virulent enemies of the Faith. During
> the spring and summer months when Baháʾí meetings such as Feasts,
> deepening seminars, and character-training classes were held in the court-
> yard, Siyyid Muhammad would eavesdrop from the rooftop and learn the
identity of the participants.

For that occasion, the carpet-seller had invited a group of the oppo-
> nents of the Baháʾí Faith to his house. The meeting at the Khál Aʿzam’s
> house started with the chanting of an opening prayer after which the
> chairman introduced Mr. Balyúzí, and the latter came to the podium.
> However, before he could commence speaking, a large rock was hurled
> from the rooftop, striking and breaking the lamp that had been placed
> on the podium. Naturally, the meeting disbanded. At that moment foes
> quickly descended from the roof and were joined by some other thugs
> who had been expecting the signal and had been waiting in the street,
> and together they attacked the friends. The believers also rushed forth in
> their own defense, and a ﬁerce commotion ensued. The long corridor371
> of the building became the scene of a very intense battle, and several of
> the friends suﬀered serious injuries. However, soon the friends managed
> to overpower their foes and disarm the attackers. The young among
> the Baháʾís lost no time in using the same clubs and sticks against the
instigators.372

The friends immediately informed Lutfuʾlláh Khán Munajjim, who was a
> very inﬂuential man and had a senior position in the police department.373
> He quickly went to the magistrate’s headquarters and spoke threateningly
> to the chief of police, the Diyáʾu’s-Sultán, inducing the latter into action.
> In no time, he came to us in the company of several gendarmes, and they
> arrested all the attackers, whether injured or not. On the following day,
> Munajjim ﬁled oﬃcial charges of disturbance of the peace and assault

The old houses in Shíráz had an underground corridor that connected the main
entrance to the courtyard. Presumably, a similar passageway is being referred to here.

Parenthetically, A.Q. Afnán notes: “For many years the pistols and clubs conﬁscated
> from the attackers were kept in the oﬃce of the Spiritual Assembly as a reminder of that
incident.”

A.Q. Afnán (private communication, December 1995) clariﬁed that Munajjim was
an attorney who served in what today may be considered the general prosecutor’s oﬃce.

> with intent to kill against the entire group of the enemies, and their ﬁle
was sent to the judiciary.

The transgressors were detained for several more days until the court
> was ready to hear their case and try them for the crimes committed. Of
> course, by then the entire city was astir with the news, and all sorts of
> rumors were circulating among the people. What was most evident was
> that the entire town was put on notice that if they inequitably dealt with
> Baháʾís, or any other group, then the full force of the law would deal
with the oﬀenders.

In preparation for the court trial, a deposition was organized in the
> Central Judiciary Building where the highest echelon of the provincial
> government were in attendance, men like the governor-general of Fárs,
> Akbar Mírzá, the Sarimuʾd-Dawlih; the military commander, General
> Ayram; the chief magistrate; the State’s public defender, Sarábandí; and
> heads of various departments. Munajjim was also invited to represent the
interests of the Faith and to speak on behalf of Baháʾís.

At the start of the deliberations, Munajjim spoke strenuously, stating the
> need to punish the oﬀenders to the full extent of the law so that people
> would thoroughly realize that during the reign of Reza Sháh Pahlaví it
> was the law that ruled and the tyranny of the mullás was at long last a
> nightmare of the past. He spoke most eﬀectively of the dark cloud of
> injustice that for so many centuries enveloped the horizon of Iran in the
> name of the Shiʿite ecclesiastics and ijtihád. Moreover, he spoke of the
> need to set an example so that a heedless population would be awakened
> to the civil liberties guaranteed under the law for each person and the
right of Baháʾís to assemble unmolested.

In his presentation, Sarábandí responded by completely agreeing with
> every point raised by the prosecution. However, he appealed on humani-
> tarian grounds, stating, “These oﬀenders, though unquestionably guilty of
> the heinous act with which they are charged, nevertheless, have families
> for whom they must provide. If they were sent to prison, then surely
> their wives and children would suﬀer greatly as well and remain in dire
> need of their daily bread. In fact, as these men have been jailed during
> the past few days, their families are already perturbed and experiencing
> many diﬃculties. I am certain that the honored Munajjim wishes not
> to see innocent children suﬀer and prefers forgiveness to vengeance. As
> such, as the public defender for the province, I ask forgiveness for the
> transgressions committed and the dropping of the charges. My clients
> will not only pay for all the damages but also provide the court with a

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 242                                                                     7/10/2008 2:44:13 PM

> written guarantee that they will never again commit such deeds. I beg of
you to let them go free and close this case.”

As a gesture of Baháʾí magnanimity, Munajjim consented for the charges
> to be dismissed, which greatly heightened the prestige of the Faith in the
> eyes of the public and won the esteem and admiration of the assembled
high-ranking oﬃcials.

In short, although that night Balyúzí was not able to deliver his speech,
> a most favorable situation was created for the Cause; as well, Siyyid Qálí-
> Furúsh and his accomplices were prevented from ever causing troubles in
> regard to the Mashruquʾl-Adhkár.

Endowments of the House of the Báb

> In the year 1315 Sh [1936], Hájí Siyyid Muhammad<46>, a son of the
> Vakíluʾd-Dawlih, donated part of his estate in Tihrán [in the Shimrán
> district] for the purpose of renovating the Blessed House of the Báb. He
> transferred the legal deeds of these properties, recorded as worth 500,000
> tumáns,374 to the beloved Guardian. Because of the unusual nature of this
> contribution, the details were reported to Reza Sháh Pahlaví who was told,
> “The recipient of this sum is not a resident of Iran, and the actual value
> of the properties is far beyond what has been recorded in the deed.” The
monarch ordered a thorough investigation.

It is unknown to me how the police grew cognizant of this situation,
> but as a result, Siyyid Muhammad was summoned for the investigation
> and questioned regarding the transaction. Without stipulating any refer-
> ence to the House of the Báb or to Shoghi Eﬀendi, he had replied, “For
> many years I have had commercial dealings in Shíráz with a close relative,
> Áqá Mírzá Hádí.375 I had purchased these properties with his money and,
> now that he is in the evening of his life, wish to reimburse the sum so I
> will not be under the weight of such obligations.”

The actual value of these lands went into the millions and represented an excep-
> tional contribution for that period. It should be borne in mind that the Vakíluʾd-Dawlih
> ranked among the wealthiest citizens, and only a fraction of his vast estate had previously
> been used for the construction of the Temple in ʿIshqábád. Even though this gift was
> earmarked for the House of the Báb, it was clearly meant as a general contribution to
> the Baháʾí International Fund, as the needs of the House of the Báb were considerably
less than this amount.

Shoghi Eﬀendi’s father.

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 243                                                                                 7/10/2008 2:44:13 PM

Despite his testimony, the police had mentioned in their report to
> the Sháh that this contribution was to establish a very sizeable religious
> endowment associated with the House of the Báb. Through this report,
> the matter had become even more serious, and the governor-general of
> Fárs, the Prince Dawlatsháhí, was instructed to visit the House of the
> Báb for a thorough determination and to report his ﬁndings directly to
> the royal court. As such, Dawlatsháhí, the police commissioner, as well
> as Lutﬁ-ʿAlí Muʿadil, the provincial deputy to the national parliament,
> came to the House of the Báb and were welcomed by my father [Mírzá
> Habíbuʾlláh]. These distinguished guests were received in the same room
> designated for the arrival and welcome of the pilgrims. After the customary
> pleasantries, with the utmost respect the visiting gentlemen requested the
> privilege of viewing the House of the Siyyid-i-Báb. My father led them
on a tour of the House.

After having expressed their appreciation for the remarkable air of
> spirituality and beauty that surrounded every aspect of that House, they
> asked, “Where are the endowment properties associated with this House?”
> “In the Baháʾí Faith,” my father had replied, “There is no such thing as
> endowments for Holy Places. The general funds of the Cause pay for the
> maintenance and upkeep of all such properties throughout the world.”
> They further queried, “It has recently come to our attention that one of
> your relatives has endowed some of his properties in Tihrán speciﬁcally
> for this House.” Not knowing anything about this contribution, my father
expressed his lack of knowledge.

“Are you acquainted with Hájí Mírzá Muhammad in Tihrán?” they
> asked. My father responded, “Yes, indeed. He is a close relative and one
> of distinguished members of the Afnán family.” The governor stated, “This
> individual has donated a considerable amount of land in Tihrán in the
> name of Shoghi Eﬀendi, the Head of the Baháʾís.” Unaware of any such
> thing, my father was inspired to reply, “I have not been told of this, nor
> has he written me about it. However, I have frequently heard him say
> that he owed money to Áqá Siyyid [Muhammad-] Husayn<37> and Áqá
> Mírzá Hádí<96> from the time that they had business dealings in Shíráz
> and that he wished to repay his debt. Therefore, it seems likely that he
was merely repaying his debt.”

The visitor continued to inquire further about the history of the House
of the Báb, the number of pilgrims, and other similar matters. My father

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 244                                                                   7/10/2008 2:44:14 PM

> had replied, “This was the residence of the Siyyid-i-Báb and is considered
> by Baháʾís the holiest site in the whole of Iran. I, being a blood relation
> of the Báb, have been the hereditary-custodian of this Ediﬁce since the
> passing of my father. Baháʾís from diﬀerent parts of Iran and the rest of
> the world come for visitation to this House and are welcomed and given
the same reception that you enjoyed today.”

The governor further asked, “How do you manage to meet the required
> expenses associated with welcoming visitors and maintaining the House?”
> “From the return on the business interests and the properties that I have
> inherited from my mother’s family, I am able to meet such obligations.
> The details of my personal estate are well-known to the honored Muʿadil.”
> At that point Muʿadil had spoken extensively, extolling the sagacity, the
> trustworthiness, and the nobility of the Afnán family, and on this note
the meeting had concluded.

Upon their departure, my father had immediately communicated
> the gist of the interview to Siyyid Muhammad in Tihrán so that in the
> event that he was also questioned, their answers would be consistent. In
> a response cable, Hájí Mírzá Muhammad, after expressing immense aﬀec-
> tion and humility, had said that he, too, had replied in the same manner
and that both were guided by Baháʾuʾlláh in this regard.

Since the governor’s report contained the same exact details that were
> said by Siyyid Muhammad, Reza Sháh did not pursue the matter any
> further, and the whole incident quieted down.

The Centenary Celebration of the Báb’s Declaration

> The year 1323 Sh [1944] corresponded with the centennial celebration
> of the Declaration of the Báb, and the beloved Guardian wished to mark
> the event most appropriately throughout the world. For the West, he had
> labored hard for many years to produce a beﬁtting gift in the form of God
> Passes By. For the East, however, it needed to be accompanied with a dif-
> ferent form of commemorative observance. Shoghi Eﬀendi had instructed
> the delegates to the national Baháʾí convention to gather in Shíráz and hold
> a beﬁtting celebration on 23 May 1944 under the shadow of the House
> of the Báb. He had further stated that should unforeseen circumstances
> prevent their gathering in the Blessed House, then some other location
in Shíráz or its vicinity was to be used for the occasion.

Thrilled at the prospect, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʾís
of Iran decided to keep the matter conﬁdential, lest it attract the atten-

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 245                                                                  7/10/2008 2:44:14 PM

> tion of foes and provoke them into mischief. Therefore, the delegates [to
> the national convention] were not informed until ﬁfteen days before the
> event and were instructed to be in Shíráz on the appointed day without
disclosing their destination to anyone.

It was about this time that Dr. Dhabíhuʾlláh Qurbán had been expelled
> from the community, and the National Spiritual Assembly was somewhat
> concerned that certain diﬃculties would be provoked from that quarter.376
> At the same time they had received a cable from the Guardian, which
read, “Keep an eye on Shíráz Assembly.”

Later, it became apparent that the Guardian was referring to the
> dangerous presence of ʿAbduʾlláh Mustaqimí on the Spiritual Assembly,
> since through various avenues of deceit this man strove to create diﬀer-
> ences among the believers and to engender pessimism. He even went so
> far as to accuse various prominent believers of the most unseemly deeds.
> Another who was under the direct inﬂuence of Mustaqimí was Captain
Thábit-Rásikh—eventually both were expelled from the community.

In order to make arrangements for the forthcoming celebration and
> also to monitor the work of the Spiritual Assembly, [the later Hands of
> the Cause] Áqá Mírzá Vallíuʾlláh Varqá and Colonel Jalál Kháziʿ arrived
> in Shíráz about a month prior to the festivities. In the course of their
> consultation with the Spiritual Assembly, they were careful not to divulge
> anything about the centenary celebrations. The honored Varqá, however,
> conﬁdentially acquainted my father with Shoghi Eﬀendi’s wish about this
celebration and emphasized to him the need for absolute secrecy.

My father asked the women of his household to make large quantities
> of every possible kind of homemade sweetmeats, and when they asked
> about the intended purpose of these preparations, he only vaguely replied,
> “Since there will be a celebration in Tihrán, I plan to take sweets as my
oﬀering.”

A week before the centenary celebrations, the honored Varqá informed
> the Spiritual Assembly of the Guardian’s directive and the arrival of del-
> egates to Shíráz. The Spiritual Assembly immediately started to arrange
> living quarters for the anticipated guests, and the homes of the friends
> throughout Shíráz were readied. Further, in order not to draw attention

Dr. Qurbán had married a Muslim woman without a Baháʾí ceremony and had
> refused instructions to rectify the matter, and he was therefore expelled from the Baháʾí
> Faith by the Guardian. The family of Qurbán and the majority of the Dihqán clan con-
> tinued to associate with him, and one after another were excommunicated.

> to the event, all Baháʾí activities at the Hadíratuʾl-Quds were suspended,
and the pilgrims’ visits to the House of the Báb were cancelled.

The Shíráz Spiritual Assembly gave the overall responsibility for the
> arrangements to Áqá Mírzá Fadluʾlláh Hakím-Banán, who in turn selected
> a few members of the Youth Committee to aid him. His wonderful eﬀorts
> for the success of this celebration were very much appreciated by everyone,
and many other families assisted in various ways with all the details.

At last, on that sacred and holy night, the National Spiritual Assembly
> as well as ninety-three delegates to the national convention gathered in the
> hallowed vicinity of the Blessed House. The courtyards and the chambers
> of the House were illumined with so many lamps that the brightness and
luster of that glorious night dazzled the eyes.

At the beginning of the celebration, the entire congregation stood in
> attention while four specially appointed believers, that is, Vallíuʾlláh Varqá,
> Dr. Yunis Khán Afrúkhtih, Núriʾd-Dín Khán Fath-Aʿzam,377 and my father,
> went inside to spread the pure-silk carpet that was gifted for that occasion
> by the beloved Guardian. This carpet was spread in the upper chamber
> of the House of the Báb, the very spot where a hundred years earlier the
Báb had illumined the world with His Manifestation.

A few minutes before the hour of the Declaration, the honored Varqá
> announced, “Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh Afnán, as Custodian of the House of the
> Báb, will lead the assembled friends on a pilgrimage through the Sanctiﬁed
> House. We will follow his example, reverently visiting and paying homage
> to the spot where His Holiness the Primal Point was seated at the hour
> of His Declaration. Afterwards, with the utmost humility and serenity we
> will exit the House. At that time, the honored Mírzá Habíb Afnán will
> chant Baháʾuʾlláh’s Surih Hajj revealed in honor of this House, and then
the Guardian’s Lawh-i Qarn378 will be recited.”

After the visit to the House was completed, the secretary of the National
> Spiritual Assembly, ʿAlí-Akbar Furútan, recited the letter of the Guardian
> in its entirety. This luminous and heavenly celebration continued until the
> early hours of the morning, and at the end all partook of breakfast in the
> courtyard of the house adjacent to the House of the Báb. Thus, the most
> glorious and magniﬁcent celebration in the history of the Cause in Iran
> concluded in an atmosphere of the utmost joy and felicity.

The following day a group of delegates returned to their homes, while

able to once more visit the Sacred House of the Báb.

The Renewal of Diﬃculties in Shíráz

> During the years 1310 to 1320 Sh [1931–41], which corresponded to the
> reign of Reza Sháh, no incidents against the Faith took place in Shíráz.
> Most meetings and large gatherings, especially the Ridván festivities,
> were celebrated in the public orchards and parks, which were protected
by the police.

However, a few years after the abdication of Reza Sháh, in the open-
> ing days of 1324 Sh [spring 1945], Siyyid Núriʾd-Dín rose in inﬂuence
> and gathered the people of Shíráz around him. His initial target was the
> House of the Báb, and he targeted it by focusing on the neighboring
> mosque.380 He would ascend the pulpits and vociferously proclaim, “O
> my brothers! There exists a small, broken mosque in the Shimshírgarhá
> Street, near the House of the Bábís. Against the wish of those who desire
> naught but the destruction and obliteration of our holy places, we must
> arise to repair this Masjid. We must build for it a beﬁtting pulpit and
> choose a worthy píshnamáz [prayer guide] to lead the congregation in
> their obligatory prayers and organize prayer vigils.” In such fashion, he
> would go on for some time and speak of the signiﬁcance of rebuilding
the mosque next to the House of the Báb.

His sermons succeeded in winning support for his designs, and several
from among his congregation proclaimed their readiness for the task and

A moving account of this event is reported in The Baháʾí World, vol. 10, pp. 181–84.

> within a few days repaired and prepared the mosque. For the inauguration,
> Siyyid Núriʾd-Dín was the honored guest, and as sign of respect, his fol-
> lowers carpeted the streets along his path and with much ostentation and
> pageantry brought him to the Masjid. He began his sermons by taking
> exception to Baháʾís and praised God that once more the forsaken mosque
had ﬂourished and the call of God was raised within that building.

In short, as result of the opening of the mosque, traffic in the
> Shimshírgarhá Street increased considerably. Gradually, the visits of
> Baháʾís to the House of the Báb became a topic of constant discussion
> not only at this mosque but also in Sháh-Chiráq, Masjid Vakíl, and other
> locations. Of course the ﬂow of Baháʾí pilgrims, particularly during such
> sacred seasons as Ridván or Naw-Rúz, even when undertaken with great
> wisdom, drew great notice in the neighborhood and provoked much
> hostility. Siyyid Núriʾd-Dín interpreted continual visits to the House of
> the Báb as an eﬀort to undermine his own authority and, therefore, set
> out to incite the people of Shíráz and other towns against the Baháʾís.
> In particular, the friends in Sarvistán, Nayríz, Jahrum, and Ábádih were
placed under great pressures during this period.

The reopening of the mosque and the increased focus on the House of
> the Báb multiplied my father’s worries by many fold. Led by Ridázádih,
> a son-in-law of Siyyid Núriʾd-Dín, most nights the crowds of so-called
> worshipers would pass through the street and loudly protest under various
> pretexts. These comings and goings were particularly intensiﬁed during
> the months of Muharram, Safar, Shaʿbán, and Ramadán, as well as on all
> occasions associated with the Prophet Muhammad and the Holy Imáms.
> On these nights, whatever the weather, my father would go onto the
> roof of the house adjacent to the Blessed House, overlooking the street.
> He would sit guarding the perimeter, peering through holes of the fence,
> watching their activities until the last person had left the mosque and the
door was locked. Only then would he consider it safe to come inside.

Another incident that took place in the year 1326 Sh [1947] was the
> following: One day Brigadier General Qavámí, the Furúghuʾl-Mulk, who
> was the police commissioner and a close friend of my father, informed
> him, “It has come to my attention that Siyyid Núriʾd-Dín and his follow-
> ers are [secretly] planning to commit arson at the House of the Báb. Of
> course, I will assign security oﬃcers to patrol Shimshírgarhá Street round
> the clock, but for a while you must observe the utmost wisdom in your
dealings lest troubles be created.”

That very afternoon, multitudes of our adversaries began to frequent
the [Shamshírgarhá] Street. They carried with them such provisions as

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 249                                                                 7/10/2008 2:44:14 PM

> straw, kerosene, gasoline, and gunpowder, and stockpiled them inside
> the mosque. Deeply perturbed over the fate that awaited the Blessed
> House, my father secluded himself in the upper chamber of the House
> and unceasingly would chant [Baháʾuʾlláh’s] Salát Hájjat,381 [the Báb’s]
Duʿá Tavassul, and other protection prayers.

On the same street lived a policeman who was very close to Siyyid
> Núriʾd-Dín and who was related to the custodian of the mosque as well.
> At times he would visit my father and would boast about the plans and
> the popularity of the Siyyid. That day it so happened that about one hour
> before dusk he came for one of these occasional visits. In addition, by
> chance, Ustád Áqá Ján Muqanní [the well-digger] and several of his crew
> were present concluding some business account. Moreover, a few Baháʾí
> youth from Sarvistán were also there for the purpose of pilgrimage to the
> House of the Báb, and all had gathered in the courtyard. Resting against
> the wall was my father’s hunting gun and some boxes of bullets. When
> the policeman came inside, my father called to him and with the utmost
> severity said to him, “Go and tell that frivolous Siyyid that if he or others
> are foolish enough to step into this street this night, his life will be in
> great peril. These men and another ﬁfty armed Baháʾís, who are waiting
> nearby, are determined to protect this House with their very lives. Should
> the crazed Siyyid take one step into this neighborhood, then blood will
> be spilled, and his will be the ﬁrst. Tonight is the night that we intend
> revenge for all the harm that you people have perpetrated and a lifetime
> of transgression that we have endured. He should be advised not to act
in such a way as would cause a great bloodbath on this very street.”

Having never heard my father speak in such vehement fashion, the
> guardsman withdrew in haste and proceeded directly to inform the
> Siyyid of my father’s message. He had not only added much of his own
> embellishments but also reported that he had witnessed a number of
> eager Baháʾís arrayed for this purpose, with guns and munitions at their
> side. These exaggerated reports served to frighten the Siyyid who at once
> instructed his followers to cancel their plans and not to be seen in our
> district. Further, that very night he sent several of his men to remove the
> provisions for arson from the mosque. No incident took place that night,
> and for quite some time the Siyyid and his men posed no threat to the
> House of the Báb or to the believers.

The day after this event, the Furúghuʾl-Mulk telephoned my father and
> in the course of expressing his elation for the way that aﬀairs had unfolded,
> remarked, “I am puzzled as to what caused the Siyyid to change his mind
> and not attack your House.” My father made reply, “The Siyyid’s goal
> is to serve himself; however, mine is to serve God. Consequently, with
> every breath I am guided, while he is left to his own devices. The divine
> conﬁrmations can reduce mountains and still every storm. But in fact, it
> is not we who are guided, rather we are unworthy instruments for His
> all-encompassing Will.”

The Passing of Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh Afnán

> Near the end of his life, my father developed acute asthma, coupled with
> a heart problem, and consequently needed to rest more often. However,
> not once did he fall short in his duties and responsibilities as the custo-
> dian of the Blessed House and continued unabated to serve as before,
> and he was always present at the meetings of the Spiritual Assembly and
> other gatherings. Every day before dawn, he would be ready to welcome
> and receive the pilgrims to the sacred threshold of the House of the Báb,
> and he would exert much care ensuring that each visitor had a most
> spiritual and uplifting experience and thoroughly appreciated this divine
> benediction. For each group that visited, with greatest care and reverence
> he would prepare the Sacred Writings and Holy Relics associated with
> such visits, and afterwards would gather them with his own hands and
> place them in their special container. His insistence on continuing with
> the daily routines as before severely worsened his condition and ﬁnally
placed him at death’s door.

In short, after several heart attacks, in the month of Mihr of the
> year 1330 Sh [September 1951] he was bedridden. His physician, Dr.
> Muʿtamid, a most competent man who had been trained in Paris and who
> specialized in heart conditions, was able to make him more comfortable
> during his last days. My father ﬁnally passed from this nether world for
> the eternal abode on 30 Ázar 1330 Sh [22 December 1951] at the age
> of seventy-four. The telegram of the beloved Guardian on this occasion
> was our sole consolation and greatly calmed the heart and soul of every
> member of his family.

APPENDIX TWO

BAHÁʾÍ HISTORICAL PLACES IN SHÍRÁZ382

1. The House of the Báb

> In the Writings of the Báb, His Blessed House has been given unique
> and everlasting favors. Such blessings are found in: the Qayyumuʾl-Asmaʾ,
> chapter Rukn (pillar), 35–38; the Persian Bayán 4:16–18; the Arabic Bayán
> 4:16–19; Tablet to Khál Akbar at the time of the Báb’s departure from
> Shíráz for Isfahán (generally understood to be His Will and Testament);
and the Kitáb Panj Shaʾn, chapter 1.

In time, it is expected that the House of the Báb will have certain
> dependencies. These are called for in the following Tablet of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá
to the Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʾís of Shíráz:

> To the members of the Spiritual Assembly, upon them rest the Glory of
God, the Most Glorious.

> O servants of the Abhá Beauty! Your missive arrived, and its contents were
> made manifest. Similarly, your letter to the illustrious Afnán of the Lote-
> Tree, upon him rest the Glory of God, the Most Glorious, was received, as
> well as his response to your Assembly, which were most carefully perused,
and I regret the delay in responding.

Through the conﬁrmations of the Ancient Beauty, may My spirit be a
> sacriﬁce unto His friends, the Sacred House has been rescued from ruins
> and, through all available means, was rebuilt in the manner of former times.
> Through the assistance of the Greatest Name, various dependencies of that
> Mighty House, such as a hospital, an orphanage, a home for the elderly,
> and others will be constructed and completed in time. . . .383

> During the early part of this century [the twentieth century], the resi-
> dence next to the House of the Báb was also purchased and made part
> of the Blessed House. Three of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s Tablets providing detailed

For the most part, this appendix is a translation of excerpts of Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán’s

at this juncture:

He is the Most Glorious.

> O ye illustrious Afnán! A few months ago, a prayer was revealed beseeching
> protection and divine favors for all the Afnán of the sanctiﬁed Tree and
> praising the qualities of the oﬀshoots of the sacred Tree, but news of its
> arrival hath not been received. Nor hath there been any news of receipt of
> one thousand tumáns sent for the purchase of the adjacent home. Inform
> on what ye have done regarding that house and how much hath been
> received through [Hájí] Amín. But do so urgently. If you do not have time
> to write, then ask someone else to report on your behalf. It hath been a
> while since any news or communication from the Afnán of Shíráz hath
been received.

I am encompassed by assaulting multitudes of mischief, diﬃculties, and
> calumnies, and because I must write to the whole world, not a moment is
> left to me. Notwithstanding, I write in my own hand that ye may realize
> how profoundly I care about this important undertaking. The object is, God
> willing, that the house adjacent to that Sanctiﬁed Court will be purchased,
> that none might be permitted to verbally or physically become presumptu-
> ous towards it. This house will be like a fortiﬁed foundation and a secure
and permanent perimeter.

Through the protection and favors of the Blessed Beauty, we remain
> steadfast and determined, and beseech mighty conﬁrmations and great
> blessings for the illustrious Afnán of the sacred Lote-Tree. Upon them all
rest the Glory of God, the Most Glorious.

ʿAbduʾl-Bahá ʿAbbás.384

> The second Tablet of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá about the purchase of the adjacent
house follows:

He is the Most Glorious.

> O ﬁrm oﬀshoots of the sacred Lote-Tree! Your latest letter indicated that the
> promised house was purchased on 22 Ramadán [9 June 1920] for twenty-six
> hundred tumáns cash and a one hundred and seventy-ﬁve tumáns mort-
> gage. That is, for a total of twenty-seven hundred and seventy-ﬁve tumáns.
> Through whatever means possible, God willing, the ﬁnal seven hundred and
> seventy-ﬁve tumáns will be raised and forwarded to you. Prepare an exact
ﬁnancial ledger of this transaction so that records may be kept.

Regarding the property title: twice we purchased the House of Baghdad,
> and yet have lost it in both instances. Once it was purchased in the name
> of Áqá Siyyid Ahmad and another time by Hájí Husayn, and every time,
> after their passing, the House was lost to us. Therefore, you must act in
> such wise that no diﬃculty would be encountered in the future.

ʿAbbás.385
The third Tablet of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá states:

> Shíráz. The illustrious Afnán of the sacred Lote-Tree, the honored Áqá Mírzá
Buzurg, upon him rest the Glory of God.

He is the Most Glorious.

> O thou oﬀshoot of the divine Lote-Tree! Thy letter dated 20 Muharram AH
> 1339 [4 October 1920] was received, and its contents caused the utmost
> joy and felicity on account of the news of the prescribed House. Praised be
> God that eﬀorts were exerted and that house became part of the estate of
> the Blessed House [of the Báb]. In these days, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s joy concerns
> things as pertain to the Exalted One, the Primal Point, may my spirit be
> sacriﬁced for Him, or to the blessed Threshold of Baháʾuʾlláh, may my spirit
be a sacriﬁce for His servants.

Glorify thy God and thank Him for having favored thee with such bounty
> and allowed thee to render such service! Two thousand tumáns were sent
> through the honored Amín, and praised be God it hath arrived. Through
> the divine benevolence, I cherish the hope that thou wilt be rendered suc-
> cessful in all thine undertakings. The account that thou didst send was
clear and accurate.

2. Birthplace of the Báb

> This house was situated between the residences of Hájí Mírzá Siyyid
> Muhammad, known as the Khál Akbar, and that of Hájí Mírzá Siyyid
> ʿAlí, surnamed the Khál Aʿzam. The illustrious Báb was born in the upper
> chamber of the house, a room situated in the northwestern corner of the
building.387

In the original design, the western ﬂank of the house consisted of the
> main entrance, which opened onto the street behind the house; three
> rooms and two corridors on the lower ﬂoor; and two rooms on the second
> ﬂoor. The central room on the lower ﬂoor was called “ursí ” and had ﬁve
> doors and a ceiling as high as the entire building. This room was situated

Three years after the Báb, Khadíjih Bagum was also born in this house.

> in the center of the building, and two rather large corridors connected
> to either side of it. In addition, another room opened onto each of the
> corridors and had an entrance on the opposite side as well. At the end of
> each corridor, two spiral staircases connected the lower ﬂoor to the upper
> one and opened onto what was known as two-Gúshvarih [shape of two
> symmetrical earrings]. The rooms on the upper ﬂoor were situated over
the chambers below.

Originally, this house was a property of Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí<3>, the son
> of Áqá Mírzá ʿAbid. With his passing, it came into the possession of his
> four children, each having an equal share. When the business activities of
> the older son of Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí (namely, Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim<11>)
> ﬂourished, he bought a few contiguous, smaller buildings situated in the
> Maydán Sháh quarter of Shíráz. He decided to demolish these and build
> a new, much larger, luxurious home in their place and to move his fam-
> ily there from the Bazaar Murgh quarter. His brother, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid
> Hasan<10>, was a young man and moved to Yazd at about that time.
> He had no interest in his inherited share of the ancestral home. Zahrá
> Bagum, the older daughter of Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí, lived with her husband,
> Áqá Mírzá Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín. Moreover, the youngest child, Khadíjih
> Bagum, the wife of the Báb, resided in the Blessed House. Therefore,
> this left vacant the house where the Báb was born, and, as such, it was
> leased to Hájí Muhammad Mihdí Hijjáb, the maternal half-brother of
these four siblings.

Hájí Hijjáb died in AH 1304 [1887]. As a favor to his nephews, Hájí
> Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim left this house to the children of the deceased. A year
> later, Hájí Mírzá himself passed away and was soon followed by two of
> his sons. His second oldest son, Áqá Mírzá Abuʾl-Hasan<38>, left Shíráz
> for ʿIshqábád and Samarqand, where he spent most of his life, and even-
> tually went to Haifa where he passed away in 1921. As such, the only
> legal and rightful heir of this house was Áqá Siyyid Muhammad-Husayn
> Afnán<37>, but he was unable to counter the claims of Hijjáb’s family
and lost his claim to the property.

Eventually, these occupants sold the house to a carpet-seller who was
> among the most determined enemies of the Baháʾí Faith.388 His occupancy
> of the house, so close to the houses of the two uncles, caused many dif-
> ﬁculties. Ultimately, the municipality demolished the eastern section of

See appendix 1, which outlines Hasan Balyúzí’s visit to Shíráz and gives an example
of this carpet-seller’s sedition.

> this house because it was in the path of Sháh-Chiráq Street. At that time,
> the Spiritual Assembly tried hard to buy the house, but even then, out
> of spite for the Baháʾí Faith, the owner did not agree to sell. He donated
> it to the Mihdiyyih and placed a sign [of the Mihdiyyih] on the house.
> Finally, during the expansion of the Sháh-Chiráq Circle, the entire build-
> ing was demolished.

3. House of the Khál Aʿzam

> ʿAbduʾl-Bahá named this house a Mashriquʾl-Adhkár. It ranks among the
> most sacred Baháʾí places in Shíráz, claiming a singular spiritual station.
> After the passing of His father, the Báb moved His residence to this house,
> where He lived until the age of ﬁfteen. After His return from Mecca, He
> was subjected to harm and torment by the Sáhib-Ikhtíyár, the governor
> of Fárs, and to subsequent imprisonment. He was freed only after the
> Imám-Jumʿih intervened and the Khál Aʿzam oﬀered a surety. Further,
> it was agreed that the Báb would stay in the house of the Khál and not
> associate with those who sought His audience. These sanctions proved
> eﬀective, and with the passage of time, a measure of tranquility was realized.
> Eventually, favorable conditions allowed for regular meetings between the
> Báb and His followers in this very house. It was here that such disciples as
> Mullá Husayn, Siyyid Husayn Yazdí, Mullá ʿAbduʾl-Karím Qazvíní, Mullá
> Shaykh ʿAlí ʿAzím, and other learned Bábís such as Siyyid Javád Karbaláʾí
> were admitted to the sanctiﬁed presence of the Báb. It was also here that
> the celebrated Vahíd Dárábí attained the Báb’s luminous audience and the
> Commentary on the Surih of Kawthar revealed for him, enabling him to
drink his ﬁll from the chalice of certitude.

After the Báb’s mother departed for Karbalá, Khadíjih Bagum left the
> House of the Báb and took up residence here. She stayed for many years
> and was able to welcome and entertain such honored guests as Munírih
> Khánum [ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s future wife]. After the martyrdom of the Khál
> Aʿzam, this house was left in the custody of his wife [Hájíyyih Bíbí Ján-
> Ján] and his son, Mírzá Javád<23>. After them, two-thirds of the property
> was claimed by non-Baháʾí heirs, who decided to sell their portion in AH
> 1327 [1909]. Áqá Siyyid Muhammad-Husayn Afnán<37> communicated
> this news to the Holy Land. Consequently, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá instructed the
> Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih<99> to purchase these shares in the name of the
> Baháʾí community. He carried out the Master’s instructions through Hájí
> ʿAbduʾr-Rahmán Kumpání, and the house came into the Baháʾí Faith’s

> possession. In a Tablet addressed to Áqá Siyyid Muhammad-Husayn Afnán,
the beloved ʿAbduʾl-Bahá states:

> Thou hadst written regarding the house that was the dwelling of the illustri-
> ous branch of the sacred Tree, the martyred uncle, Áqá Siyyid ʿAlí—may
> My spirit be a sacriﬁce unto him. That house was the residence of the
> Holy Dove and situated next to the House of the luminary of the Supreme
> Concourse, the Primal Point—may My spirit, My essence, and My whole
> being be a sacriﬁce unto Him. Therefore, that house is considered among
the Holy Places, deserving utmost attention and consideration.

Convey My warmest greetings to the honored celestial twig, Mírzá ʿAlí-
> Muhammad Khán [the Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih] and inform him on my behalf,
> “O wondrous branch! With utmost attention and determination, exert thyself
> in securing that sacred house from the hands of the nonbelievers and turn it
> into a Mashriquʾl-Adhkár. However, if this would incite uproar among the
> rabble, then it is suﬃcient to have the sacred house in our possession and to
> quietly organize meetings where the friends, in the morning and at dusk, can
> oﬀer prayers and meditations. Through the blessing of this magniﬁcent deed,
> the hearts will turn to the Merciful Lord, exultation will be raised, rapture
> will surround all, the ﬁre of God’s love will glow brilliantly, and unsurpassed
> excitement will envelop the friends. In other lands, the Mashriquʾl-Adhkár
> hath precipitated outpourings of divine favors, caused the hearts to overﬂow
> with immense joy and felicity, and hath bestowed divine radiance on all
> souls. In Shíráz, however, utmost wisdom and prudence must be observed
> so that nonbelievers may not become informed. Even among the friends it
> should be called a spiritual gathering. Otherwise, the unworthy will plot
> sedition [to destroy it] and provoke fear in the hearts. . . .”
> After a while, the house became the gathering point of the teachers and
> promoters of the Baháʾí Faith, and general meetings, Holy Day celebra-
> tions, deepening classes, and institutes were held there. Moreover, it
> sheltered the friends who visited from other cities. As such, this house
> became known as the center of the Baháʾí activities of Shíráz and attracted
the attention of foes.

In 1324 Sh [1945], the Shíráz municipality ordered that Lutf-ʿAlí Khán
> Zand Street be extended to the vicinity of Sháh-Chiráq. In the process,
> they had to demolish all the buildings in their path. This house was one
> of those properties, and four-ﬁfths of it was demolished during the road-
> work. However, at that time, the remaining one-ﬁfth of the house was
> left untouched. This consisted of the western section, which included the
> room where the Letters of the Living would gather, the sleeping quarters
> of the Khál, and the storage room next to it. Also, the lower ﬂoor and the
> tunnel that led from the house of the uncle to the house of Áqá Mírzá
> ʿAlí—that is, the house where the Báb was born and reared—remained

> standing. On the instructions of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʾís of
> Shíráz, a wall was constructed in front of this remaining section and a
custodian appointed to look after it.

In 1348 Sh [1969], the rest of the house—mentioned in the Báb’s Will
> and Testament—and the house of the Khál Akbar were demolished at the
> instigation of Sharíﬃ, the custodian of Sháh-Chiráq, with the approval of

Biographical Notes on the Governors since 1844

> Mírzá Ahmad Khán, the ʿAláʾuʾd-Dawlih
> Born in 1866 as the second son of Muhammad-Rahím Khán, the Amír-
> Nizám, he commenced his service in the royal court at the age of sixteen.
> Four years later he had already reached the rank of Amír-Tumán (lieu-
> tenant-general) and in 1897 was ﬁrst appointed governor of Zanján and
> later in 1903 was given the same post in Fárs. Wherever he ruled, he left
> his mark as a brutal and vulgar man, known particularly for his obscene
> expressions. He became the governor of Tihrán in 1905 and soon was at
> odds with the monarch, who imprisoned him and his brother. Released
> from prison, he was caught up in the fervor of the Constitutional Revolt,
> which ﬁrst saw his home ﬁrebombed and at a later date, 1 December
> 1911, him fallen to the assassin’s bullet.

> Bahrám Mírzá, the Muʿizzuʾd-Dawlih
> The second son of ʿAbbás Mírzá, the Náyíbu’s-Saltanih, he was appointed
> governor of Kirmánsháh, Luristán, and Khúzistán in 1834. After two years,
> he was appointed governor of Qazvín, and in 1848 he gained the same
> post in Fárs, a post he held for a little more than two years. Subsequently,
> he returned to Tihrán and was given various posts until in 1858 when
> he was sent to Tabriz where he ruled for the next two years as governor.

Deposed 5 October 1876.

the governors of fárs                          265

> In 1865, he was placed in charge of the army’s internal aﬀairs, and three
> years later became the governor of Luristán, a post he alternately held with
> his brother, Hamzih Mírzá, until he died on 21 October 1882.

> Farhád Mírzá, the Muʿtamiduʾd-Dawlih
> The ﬁfteenth son of ʿAbbás Mírzá, the Náyíbu’s-Saltanih, he was born in
> April 1818. At the age of 17, his brother, Bahrám Mírzá, appointed him
> governor of Luristán. In the next several years, whenever Muhammad Sháh
> would leave the capital, Farhád Mírzá would be placed in charge of the
> city’s security and the protection of the throne. In September 1841 he
> was appointed the governor of Fárs, a post that he held for about three
> years, but he remained in Shíráz until 1855 in various senior positions. It
> is unclear why he broke rank with Násiriʾd-Dín Sháh; however, for some
> period of time between 1855 and 1862 he lived in the British Embassy
> of Tihrán under political asylum. Eventually, in 1862 he was pardoned,
> granted the title of the Muʿtamiduʾd-Dawlih, and sent oﬀ as governor of
> Luristán and Khúzistán, a post he held for two years. In 1866 he became
> governor of Kurdistán, where he remained for the next six years. During the
> monarch’s sojourn in Europe, this uncle of the Sháh was brought to Tihrán
> to assist once more with the protection of the throne in his absence. In
> spring 1876, he was appointed governor of Fárs for a second tour of duty.
> Overall, he was a vicious ruler who often boasted that he had killed more
> than 600 men and severed the hands of 700 more. His only concern was
> to amass wealth, and this he achieved at the expense of poverty-stricken
> peasants. He spent portions of his lavish estate on the construction of
> shrines in the ʿAtabát. Several books by him have remained.

> Fírúz Mírzá, the Nusratuʾd-Dawlih
> Born in 1817 as the sixteenth son of ʿAbbás Mírzá, the Náyíbu’s-Saltanih,
> he was sent by his older brother, Muhammad Sháh, to govern Fárs in
> February 1835 in the company of Manuchihr Khán, the Muʿtamiduʾd-
> Dawlih, and the British oﬃcer Sir Henry Lindsay Bethune. He gained his
> rule in Fárs after reducing the insurgents in the vicinity of Shíráz. Nearly
> two years later, he was sent to Kirmán to deal with the revolt in that region
> and was made governor of the province. In the spring of 1850, for the
> second time, he was appointed governor of Fárs, which tenure lasted some
> three years. Until 1867, he held various senior posts in Tabríz, Arák, and
> Tihrán, and in that year he was given the governorship of Khurásán—a
> post that he would hold sporadically for the next four years. In 1874 he

> Ghulám-Husayn Ghaﬀarí, the Sáhib-Ikhtíyár
> A son of Mírzá Háshím Khán, the Amínuʾd-Dawlih, he was born in 1859,
> and starting in 1882 he was given various posts within the court, mostly
> ceremonial assignments. From 1900 to 1903, he served as the justice
> minister. At the beginning of the Constitutional Revolt, that is, in 1907,
> he was given the title of the Sáhib-Ikhtíyár395 and was sent as governor
> to Fárs, where he ruled for only three months. A few months later, he
> was given the same post, but again it lasted for only a short time. In the
> latter years of his life, he served in various posts in the cabinet and died
> on 29 March 1947.

> Ghulám-Ridá Khán, the Ásifuʾd-Dawlih
> Like his father, Husayn Khán, the Nizámuʾd-Dawlih, he was a high-rank-
> ing oﬃcer. Ghulám-Ridá Khán entered military service and by 1883 had
> been elevated to general and appointed commander of the artillery forces.
> In the same year he was given the governorship of Mázandarán. Five years
> later he was again given the same post and in 1891 was sent as governor
> to Khúzistán. In summer of 1897, he was appointed governor of Kirmán,
> a post he held for two years. Afterwards, he gained various ministry posts
> in Tihrán. In 1907 he became Governor of Khurásán and in response to
> a popular uprising against him ordered a massive massacre. In 1908 he
> was given the governorship of Fárs, and under his watch the uprising of
> Lár and the pogrom of the Baháʾís of Nayríz took place.

This title was ﬁrst used by Nádir Sháh who bestowed it upon Mírzá Muhammad-

He has left a vivid autobiography, which remains unpublished.

APPENDIX FOUR

CONVERSION OF THE GREAT UNCLE OF THE BÁB

> Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad, the eldest of the maternal uncles of the
> Báb and the recipient of the Kitáb-i Íqán, was born in 1798 and is com-
> monly referred to as the Khál Akbar [the great uncle]. He was the ﬁrst-
> born of Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn, son of Áqá Mírzá ʿAbid (known
> as Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín),399 son of Áqá Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad. This family
> ranked among the best-known and most trustworthy merchants in the
> Province of Fárs. His wife, Hájíyyih Bíbí Fátimih-Sáhib, was a daughter of
> Hájí Muhammad-Muhsin and a member of another prominent merchant
> family of ʿAbduʾl-Husayní, trading in Shíráz and Búshihr, and eventually
having commercial interests that extended from India to Europe.400

Khál Akbar ran the family oﬃce in Búshihr, and consequently the Báb
> was closely associated with him during the ﬁrst four years He worked as
> a merchant there. During this period, Khál Akbar was concerned that
> the Báb’s preoccupation with religious matters would create problems and
> had remained skeptical of such proclivities. Later in the summer of 1844
> the Báb instructed Mullá ʿAlí Bastámí—the second to believe in Him—to
> journey to Búshihr and to share the news of His proclamation with Hájí
> Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad. It appears that in the course of this visit, the
uncle grew considerably in his understanding of the Báb’s claim.

A few months later, on His pilgrimage journey, the Báb stayed with the
> same uncle and once more, on 15 May 1845, visited him for ten days on
> His return as He passed through Búshihr.401 It seems that by this time,
> the uncle had developed a deep sense of respect and devotion towards
> the saintly character and even the claim of his Nephew and warmly wel-
> comed Him. It was during this visit of the Báb that the following letter
> was sent by the Khál Akbar to his own mother and sister—respectively,
> the grandmother and the mother of the Báb. The original of this letter in

> the inhabitants of earth must obey His command.ʾ”
> From the above letter, it is quite clear that the uncle believed in the Cause
> (ámr) of his Nephew and further encouraged his mother and sister—the
> mother of the Báb—to remain ﬁrm in their belief in the Báb as well.
> Therefore, it seems reasonable to surmise that by this stage at least some
> members of the Báb’s family had given their allegiance to Him and rec-
ognized Him as the author of a “Cause.”

About the same time that the above letter was penned, the uncle of
> the Báb sent another dispatch to his second brother, Hájí Mírzá Siyyid
> ʿAlí<7>, known as Khál Aʿzam (the most-great uncle).405 From the content
> of this communication, it is quite evident that the Báb had already stirred
> a considerable commotion through His claim and that many, including
> some among His immediate family, were exerting eﬀorts to discourage
> Him from continuing to advance those claims. However, it also provides
> further evidence that the Khál Akbar was by then a devoted believer in
> the Báb. The original of this letter, in the hand of the great-uncle, is also
> kept in the private library of Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán, while a typed version
> appears in the Khándán Afnán.406 The ﬁrst part of this letter deals with
the family commercial business and is omitted in the translation.407

> Also, Hájí ʿAbduʾl-Husayn has written, though his ﬁrst letter did not arrive,

After the passing of the Báb’s father, the Khál Aʿzam served as his Nephew’s guardian
and reared Him until the age 15, at which time the Báb moved to Búshihr.

Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, pp. 27–31.

The attribution of this letter to the Khál Akbar has been questioned in Amanat,
> Resurrection and Renewal, p. 355, n. 127, where it is suggested that this letter was written
> by Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí. However, the original text of the letter clearly indicates that it
> was authored by the Khál Akbar; moreover, the narrative of his son, the Vakíluʾd-Dawlih,
> quoted later in this appendix, conﬁrms that indeed it was the Khál Akbar who was in
Búshihr at this time.

Presumably, a reference to Quddús whose full name was Hájí Mullá Muhammad-
ʿAlí Bárfurúshí.

> gradually these talks may be erased from people’s memory, since they fear
that because of this [claim] we too might suﬀer injury or major losses.

My view, however, is that if we were to consider the matter from the
> worldly perspective, then it is indeed as they have stated. After reading these
> missives my Master, the honored Hájí [the Báb] became greatly depressed
> over the inﬁrmity of those who had penned these [letters]. Nevertheless, He
> stated, “Regarding the teaching of the Cause, what Akhúnd Mullá Husayn
> [Bushrúʾí] initially transmitted to the King, the ʿulamá, and the people
> should have suﬃced, and this second time was only because of Our grace,
> as there was no need for it. Now that such reactions have been observed
> and will be discerned, for [the next] ﬁve years I have forbidden unto Myself
> the revelation of verses, and this indeed is the most grievous punishment
> for such as have denied, and they will comprehend its eﬀect only after they
> have been left with no recourse. After My arrival in Shíráz, as had been My
> practice in the past, I will remain in My House and will not associate with
> anyone and will not allow others to attain unto My Presence. I will have
> no dealings with anyone and will leave people to themselves. Meanwhile,
> should anyone be found who seeks the Truth and is willing to embrace it,

> with others, others will forget about Me as well. If it were not because of
> My esteemed mother, I would never return to Shíráz and single and alone
> would establish My home in this very city [i.e., Búshihr], or would go in
a direction that none would know.”

If our honored mother desires to visit the sacred city of Mashhad, she can
> proceed with you. As such, please arrange for her journey. And by then, if
> the Hájí [the Báb] was to arrive [in Shíráz], they would be together for a few
days, and she could go afterwards. Otherwise, may they journey in peace.

In short, these were the utterances of His honored Person. It is evident
> that they are based on His being downcast, though they represent His wish.
> God willing, once He has arrived in Shíráz, He would not associate with any
> other, and the same has been His practice while in this place. And should
> anyone ask of this matter, then answer it accordingly and state that He is
> the Proof, and all others must show obedience unto Him. What they do
> not understand of His laws, they must inquire from the one designated by
> Him and follow [His ordinances] as such. He Himself will not aﬃliate with
> anyone. And the reason for designating another person is that should people
> be found who in sincerity would recognize Him and seek to understand
> [His Revelation], then they can make their inquires from this designated
> person, as otherwise he will not associate with them either. For ﬁve years it
will continue as such, until He decrees what will occur.

He [i.e., the Báb] states, “We have no concern or relation with anyone,
> and you are to continue with your business as before and fear no one. If
> you dread My coming to Shíráz, then I will not come.” His command will

Verses. Is this not proof ?

Further, your own self had written, and the esteemed Hájí ʿAbduʾl-Husayn

> him come forth and engage Me in mubahilih.”409 I take refuge with God!
> How could One Who is so self-assured, be not of the truth? If you claim
> that He suﬀers from mental disturbance, I do not share your assessment, as
> how could it be that a person is unlettered while he is sane, but then when
he is mentally disturbed he becomes so erudite?

In short, that which must have been said has been repeatedly stated. You
> know best how to act. Convey my greetings to our mother and sister, and
> kindly tell them of my condition. For me, no doubt remains. I have no
> reason [to deny the Báb], as consciously I see and perceive that this Cause

> Further, they should be aware that when the honored Hájí [the Báb] arrives
> at the city [of Shíráz], He would dismount and walk to the House. Therefore,
> it is best not to inform the people, that He may be left to Himself. Until
> now, it had been incumbent upon Him to obey their410 wishes; but now it
> is the opposite, and they must strive to obey His every command. Under
no circumstances, should they disobey Him.

I have no other matter to present you. I have written a letter for Hájí
> ʿAbduʾl-Husayn that you will also see, and perchance some things said here
> will be repeated there as well. He requested the appearance of some extraor-
> dinary event [from the Báb], such as news from the beyond. Sanctiﬁed be
> God! Repeatedly, we have beheld that He would take two small coins in
> His hand and inform us of the great beyond, and of the cherubs and angels.
> But if one’s heart has not attained certitude through knowledge, then of
> what use is conveying such stories?

> From the above text, it is evident that the Báb was deeply aﬀected by the
> lukewarm reception to His Call and had initially vowed to remain silent
> for ﬁve years and cease revealing Verses, though later in Shíráz He reversed
> this decision and continued to reveal many treatises, prayers, homilies, and
> books. Further, it can readily be surmised that the Khál Akbar counted
> himself among the Báb’s followers and was urging his younger brother,
> Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, also to embrace the new Message. It seems very

Mubahilih is the practice of opponents challenging one another to mutual cursing,
> expecting the truthful one to be safe and the wicked to receive divine chastisement. For
> example, while in Edirnih, Baháʾuʾlláh invited Mírzá Yahyá Azal to a public mubahilih,
but the latter failed to come.

Presumably, a reference to the Báb’s grandmother and mother.

Revelation of the Báb unreservedly.411

However, we must ponder the question: At this stage, what did Khál
> Akbar understand of the Báb’s claim and station? As noted earlier, the
> uncles of the Báb were merchants and enjoyed the type of education
> and training available to the business class of their age. For schooling,
> he had attended for a few years the same school in the Masjid Naw
> that years later the Báb would attend. This meant that he was taught a
> rudimentary religious education, which consisted of reading the Qurʾán
> and a general history of Islám and its laws and basic jurisprudence. As
> a merchant, he was also taught accounting, elementary economics and,
> as any middle class citizen, was familiar with well-known collections of
> poetry and literature, particularly those of Háﬁz and Saʿdí. What he most
> certainly did not possess was the sort of rigorous seminarian education
> that the typical Bábí converts of the early days had mastered through
> devoting years of training to the acquisition of such incredibly detailed
> sciences. And further, it is not clear if this uncle had actually seen any of
> the Writings of the Báb by the time he wrote the above letters. And what
> had been revealed by that time were works such as the Qayyúmuʾl-Asmá’
> and the Commentary on the Surih of the Cow, which are ﬁlled with
> subtle and complex allusions to the Báb’s prophetic mission and which
> employ very sophisticated symbolism, in all probability, remaining beyond
> the ability of the Khál Akbar to discern their full signiﬁcance. That is,
> since his knowledge and education consisted of what was common for
> the merchant class, what he may have seen of the Báb’s Writings would
> have eluded him in its full implications. Therefore, one could assert that
> the central claim of the Báb had remained essentially inaccessible to Hájí
> Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad, and as such he never realized that the Báb was
advancing claims to Qáʾimiyyat and Prophethood.

This assertion is further supported by the following two important docu-
> ments written by his son that clearly demonstrate they generally thought
> the Báb to simply be a saintly ﬁgure, perhaps the gate to the Hidden
> Imám, but no more. It should be reemphasized that this gross misunder-
> standing stemmed from the inaccessibility of the Qayyúmuʾl-Asmáʾ, for

Nabíl Aʾzam, The Dawn-Breakers, p. 143. As described in chapter 1 above, the Khál
> Aʿzam had been deeply impressed by the saintly devotion of his Nephew and, through
> his contacts with the Shaykhí community, was already expecting the Manifestation of
> the Promised One.

Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad’s eldest son, the renowned Hájí Mírzá

J-2 AH 1324 [July 1906]

The honored and revered Áqá Mírzá ʿAlí-Akbar Rafsinjání, who numbers
> among the foremost teachers of the Cause, has come to ʿIshqábád accompa-
> nied by Áqá Mírzá Tarázuʾlláh Qazvíní, son of the illustrious Samandar, for

> those kinsmen who have joined the Cause of the Ancient Beauty and have
> been named, the Afnán. Although because of the passage of time, dimin-
> ished memory, and advanced age, not all the details are recalled, however,
in order to fulﬁll his wish, the following is noted:

What this servant remembers of the said events is that prior to His dec-
> laration, the deeds, the manner, and the company of His Holiness diﬀered
> from those of other people. In the proximity of Shíráz’s Masjid Naw, Masjid
> Fath, and the Jewish neighborhood, His exalted mother, who was an aunt of
> this servant, resided in the Blessed House on the Shamshírgarhá Street—a
> House that is now the celestial Kaʿaba of the Supreme Concourse. Her sole
> oﬀspring was that Sanctiﬁed Eﬀulgence [i.e., the Báb] Whose father, Áqá
Mírzá Muhammad-Ridá, had passed away during His childhood.

This servant was a mere child when I attained His blessed presence, and
> a little of that time is recalled though other details have been forgotten. I
> remember that on Sundays I would go into the presence of my exalted aunt.
> It was in AH 1260 [1844], but I cannot be certain which month, that one
> morning I attained the presence of the Báb. He was occupied with reveal-
> ing prayers. Melon was placed before Him, and with the tip of a knife, He
> graciously oﬀered me a piece. I ate it. He handed me a page with a prayer,
> and after I had read it, He asked, “What manner of supplication do you
> consider this?” I was familiar with the Sahiﬁh-i Sadjadiyyih, recited each day
> of week and therefore replied, “It is similar to the prayer of Sahiﬁh.”413

Commonly known as al-Sahifat al-Kamilat al-Sajjadiyya, it is the collection of sup-
> plications of the fourth Shiʿi Imám, ʿAlí ibn Husayn, surnamed Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín, Who

> I remember at that time the majority of mystics and ascetics of Shíráz were
> anticipating the nearness of the Manifestation (Zuhúr). However, He had
> appeared, but was concealed from all, except the believers and devotees from
> the Shaykhí faction who upon the passing of the late Hájí Siyyid Kázim
> had gone in search of Him. It was noised abroad that a certain Person had
> appeared claiming to be the representative of the Imám (Náyíb Imám), and
> His command forbidding the use of water-pipes was circulating among the
> populace. This servant asked Him [i.e., the Báb], “Is this true?” He made
reply, “Yes, it is indeed so, and the use of water-pipes is forbidden.”

A few days later, He departed for Mecca and left us forthwith. My late
> father was in Búshihr. In Búshihr, the Báb had decided on the conversion of
> Shaykh Hasan of the family of ʿAsfúr, the Imám-Jumʿih of that city. Shaykh
Hasan had neither accepted nor rejected His claim.414

He departed on a sailing ship and along the way would reveal verses
> and homilies. In Muscat, He gained the allegiance of that city’s Imám and
revealed homilies.

Some two months after His departure, this servant left for Búshihr as well
> and was living with my late father when, some time later, the Báb returned
> from His hajj journey. In Shíráz His news was spreading exceedingly fast,
> but in accordance with His instructions, His blessed name was not known.

> the adhán formula into, “I testify that ʿAlí [i.e., the Báb] is a servant of
> Baqiyyatuʾlláh, as recorded in the perspicuous Book.”415 Because of this, the
> ʿulamá had issued a fatwá condemning the Author of this command and
> had beaten and expelled from the city the prayer leaders, namely, the late
> Mullá Muhammad-Sádiq [Khurásání] and Mullá Muhammad-ʿAlí [Quddús],
> may my spirit be a sacriﬁce unto them both.

This collection contains ﬁfty-four supplications in the main body of the text and the

of the week) and the ﬁfteen munáját or ‘whispered prayers.ʾ

Shaykh Hasan is the brother of Shaykh Husayn ʿAsfúrí, the great-grandfather of
> Vahíd Dárábí. Earlier, the Báb had made mention of Shaykh Hasan in chapter 27 of His
Qayyúmuʾl-Asmáʾ.

Nabíl Aʾzam, The Dawn-Breakers, p. 144, gives the verse of the Khasáʾil-i Sabʿih as,
> “I bear witness that He whose name is ʿAlí qabl-i Muhammad [ʿAlí before Muhammad]
> is the servant of Baqiyyatuʾlláh.”

The news of His return from Mecca reached Shíráz, and the authorities
> sent ten soldiers to arrest His Holiness. The period of His stay in Búshihr
> was ten or twelve days, and my late father and this servant would regularly
> attain unto His presence. One afternoon He said to my father, “Arrange for
> a steed, since I must journey [to Shíráz].” My father pleaded with Him to
> stay longer, but it was to no avail. My late father arranged for a mount, and
> He left. En route, from Burázján He arrived at [the village of ] Dalakí where
> the soldiers charged with His arrest passed Him by. His Holiness sent His
> servant, Mubárak, to their chief, and he was brought before the Báb. The
> Latter had told him, “Why are you going to Búshihr? State your purpose
> so that your troubles may be lessened.” He had stated their charge and was
> told, “The Person whom you seek is none other than Me.” And together
> they had left for Shíráz, and were I to tell of the events of the city, it would
require a mighty book, which is beyond the abilities of this servant.

And now I will outline the kinsmen of the Báb. There is a small Tablet
> in Yazd where the Báb has revealed, “After this Manifestation, all things
> perished, except those who were exalted.” In that same Tablet it is recorded,
> “We have accepted the kinsmen among the Letters of the Exalted,416 not
> because they were worthy in themselves, rather, because of Our love and
> aﬃnity towards them.” And the Ancient Beauty has titled the kinsmen of the
> Báb as Afnán, and at that time they included the illustrious grandmother of
> the Báb who was residing in Karbalá, together with His exalted mother. And
> His honored wife [Khadíjih Bagum] and her three distinguished bothers:
> Hájí Muhammad-Mihdí, surnamed Hijáb; Hájí Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim<11>,
> the grandfather of Áqá Siyyid Hádí<96>; Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Hasan<10>,
> the father of Mírzá Muhsin<29>; and Hájí [Siyyid Mírzá<25>], who
> were all related through marriage to the Báb, but who were also related
> through their paternal families. Also my father was alive, and his children
> included: Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí<14>; Hájí Mírzá Buzurg<15>; this
> servant [Vakíluʾd-Dawlih]<13>; and my two sisters, [Bíbí Ján Bagum<16>
> and Khadíjih-Sultán Bagum<17>]. Also among the family were my uncle,
> the late Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí<7>, who was martyred in Tihrán, and his
> son, Hájí Mírzá Javád<23>, who died at an early age. The late Hájí Mírzá
> Hasan-ʿAlí<6> was in Yazd, and his children included four sons and one
> daughter who is the mother of my children. The sister of the Báb’s wife
> [Zahrá Bagum<8>] was married to the late Mírzá Zaynuʾl-ʿAbidín, and the
> late Áqá Mírzá Áqá<24> was their son. Also a couple may be included from

> is the late Mírzá ʿAlí-Akbar, who was martyred in Baghdad.

Original, “Huruf-i Vajhih,” which literally means the Letters turned to Him, or
Exalted by Him.

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 281                                                                            7/10/2008 2:44:20 PM

• Abrogation of the use of water-pipes: Within the Shiʿite system of

> jurisprudence, it is solely the mujtahid who is authorized to pronounce
> on matters of personal law, and all others must refer to such accredited
> clerics. Clearly, the Báb was not certiﬁed as a mujtahid, and therefore
> the fact that He had forbidden the use of such a commonly practiced
> habit as the water-pipe, illustrates that He was assuming the right of
> legislation. In an important way this pronouncement, which is tanta-
> mount to innovation in matters of Islamic jurisprudence, signal led the
> abrogation of the Shi’ite system of laws.
• The second point has to do with the station of the Báb and how it

> was understood by the generality of people at that time. Even though
> the claim of the Báb to the station of Manifestionhood in such early
> Writings as the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’ is explicit and is beyond dispute, yet
> as noted earlier, such statements could initially be deciphered only by
> those suﬃciently trained. In this light it is of interest to note that the
> Vakílu’d-Dawlih reports that the Báb at that time was known as the
> Representative of the Imám—which indicates that through wisdom He
> was not divulging the full implications of His station.
• As noted earlier, this narrative clearly conﬁrms that the Khál Akbar was

> in Búshihr at the time of the Báb’s return from hajj, which provides
> further support to the fact that the Khál’s second letter was written
> from that city.

Muhammad-Taqí, and a typed version was reproduced in Khándán Afnán:417

Búshihr and Shíráz.

I dimly remember my grandfather. He had three sons: My late father; the
> late Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí<7>, the martyr; and the late Hájí Mírzá Hasan-
> ʿAlí<6>, who married in Yazd and settled there. He also had a daughter<4>
> who, after the passing of her mother—particularly frail during her ﬁnal
> years—settled in the ʿAtabát. This honored aunt, who was the mother of
> the Báb—may my spirit be a sacriﬁce unto Him—went to the ʿAtabát and
remained there until her passing.

My late father had three sons and two daughters. One was my late brother,
> Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí<14>, who was a merchant in China and who
> on his return became ill in India and passed away there. His remains were
> transferred from Bombay to Madáʾin and buried near the shrine of the
> Persian Salmán. The story of his passing and the bringing of his remains
> require a book of its own, but there is no time for it now.419 My younger
> brother<15>, the late Hájí Mírzá Buzurg, had a heart attack in Shíráz and
> passed away. My older sister passed away in Yazd, while the younger one
expired in Shíráz. My late father passed away in Shíráz.

After the dawning of the eﬀulgence of the Báb, that is, the appearance
> of the promised Qáʾim, He was sent to Tabríz, Chihríq, and Máh-Kú. The
> honored and much-loved Hájí Siyyid ʿAlí<7> decided to attain His pres-
> ence and as such left Shíráz for Yazd and then Tihrán, so that in whatever
> way possible he would be able to reach the august presence of the Exalted
> One. It was during this time, however, that the upheaval of Mázandarán
> was occurring; and wherever they found a Bábí, they would martyr him,
> and this personage was also caught in Tihrán and numbered among the
> Seven Martyrs. There were a number of well-known merchants present at
> that incident and were ready to pay a ransom to secure his release, but he
> had said, “Do not waste your money as I have come for the purpose of
martyrdom.”

On two occasions, the late Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí<14> traveled to
> China, and on the ﬁrst journey returned by way of ʿAkká, where he attained
> the presence of the Ancient Beauty and was the recipient of His inﬁnite
favors. Afterwards, he came to ʿIshqábád.

Early in my life, this servant left Shíráz for Yazd where I married and

> late Hájí Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí. After we took our leave, we returned to Shíráz
> and went before our late father, and subsequently each returned to his own
> abode. That is, this servant returned to Yazd and continued with my trade,
> and my brothers resided in Shíráz. Upon the return of Hájí Mírzá Muham-
> mad-ʿAlí from his ﬁrst journey to China and his arrival at ʿIshqábád, this
> servant wrote him and asked that he purchase some properties in that city.
> He acquired several pieces of land, houses, and shops, and wrote and sent
> the details to the presence of the Ancient Beauty. He instructed that the
> land known as Aʿzam be designated as the site for the Mashriquʾl-Adhkár.
> During His lifetime, some of this ediﬁce was raised. After His ascension,
> repeatedly the believers in ʿIshqábád appealed to Him Whom God hath
> purposed420 to build a Mashriquʾl-Adhkár. He did not accept their petition.
> Out of divine favor and grace, He instructed this servant to leave Yazd for
> ʿIshqábád and to complete most beﬁttingly the building raised partially in
> the land known as Aʿzam. He enjoined that no expense, whether contributed
by others or myself, be spared in this undertaking.

My brother had only one child, and that was Áqá Mírzá Áqá<53> who
> currently resides in Shíráz. After the ground was broken on the Aʿzam land,
> with the permission of Áqá Mírzá Áqá, the rest of the properties purchased
> by my brother for the Temple were sold, and this totaled about 30,000
> gold coins. The remaining cost was provided either by ʿAbduʾl-Bahá or
> at His bidding by believers of various cities who contributed toward this
construction.

In the presence of the [military] governor of Transcaspia, [General D.I.]
> Subotich, and the concourse of believers, the cornerstone was laid in Rajab
> AH 1320 [October 1902] The design for this nine-sided ediﬁce was provided
> by the Master, and the entire construction was done in stone and cement.
> Much metal was used in all the pillars, the domes, and the walls. During
> these days (Rabíʿuʾth-Thani and Jamádíuʾl-Avval of AH 1324 [June–July
> 1906]), the dome made from Russian iron has been installed. I cherish the
> hope that through the conﬁrmations of the Master, the remaining detailed
work will also be completed.

The above words were written previously and now, that is, Ramadán of
> AH 1324 [November 1906], praised be God, the construction has been
> completed, and we are engaged in painting the interior of the dome. About

> and being seventy-nine years of age, memory is no longer precise, yet in
order to obey his wish, I pen the following brief account.

I remember that in the years twelve hundred ﬁfty-nine until [twelve
> hundred] sixty [1843–44], many ascetics and holy men were anticipating
> the Manifestation (Zuhúr). [For instance] someone unknown prior to the
> year sixty had inscribed on the pulpit of the Masjid Jámiʿ that within three
> years the Qáʾim will appear. And also my esteemed uncle, the martyred Hájí
> Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, who attained the supreme station of sacriﬁce in Tihrán,
> quit his trading some four years prior to the advent of the year sixty and
> secluded himself expecting the Manifestation.423 Upon the Appearance, he
> readily accepted, but I was in Búshihr and did not witness the great suﬀerings
that were perpetrated against him by the governor-general of Fárs.

In the year sixty, it was noised throughout Shíráz that a beloved Siyyid
> had advanced the claim to be the Representative of the [hidden] Qáʾim
(Náyíb Qáʾim). However, His blessed Name was not known.

I remember that on Sundays I would attain the presence of my illustrious
> aunt, the mother of His Holiness. During such visits I gained admittance
> unto His presence as well. One Sunday during the month of Rajab, or
> perhaps it was Shaʿbán [July–August 1844], I attained such a blessing, and
> He was sitting in the courtyard of the House. After I received permission
> to sit, I noticed that melon was being served. With the tip of a knife, He
> oﬀered me a piece. The Báb was occupied in writing certain verses and
> prayers. He showed me a page upon which a prayer for the days of the week
> was revealed, and instructed me to read it. After I had recited it, He asked,

A moving eyewitness account of the Vakíluʾd-Dawlih’s arrival into the presence of
> ‘Abduʾl-Bahá in December 1907 is provided in Muʾayyad, Khátirát Habíb, vol. 1, pp.
> 29–30, and translated in Rabbani, Eight Years Near ʿAbduʾl-Bahá, The Diary of Dr. Habíb
Muʾayyad, chapter 2.

Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, pp. 110–13.

According to A.Q. Afnán, the ﬁnancial records of that era demonstrate that the
> second uncle of the Báb continued with his trading business well into 1845 (private cor-
> respondence, August 1997).

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 285                                                                              7/10/2008 2:44:20 PM

> “What manner of prayer do you perceive this to be?” I replied, “It is similar
to the Sahiﬁh-i Sadjadiyyih,” a prayer that was well known to me.

It was rumored that the Representative of the Imám (Náyíb Imám) had
> forbidden the use of water pipes. Therefore, I asked if indeed this was true.
He replied, “Yes, that is correct.”

That week, or perhaps the next, He departed for pilgrimage (hajj) to
> Mecca, and left by way of Búshihr. Two or three months later, in accordance
> with my father’s wishes who was in Búshihr, I too left for that city. While
> in Búshihr, we heard that Shíráz was ﬁlled with commotion as two disciples
> of the late Hájí Siyyid Kázim [Ráshtí] who were the Imám-Jumʿih and the
> muʾadhdhin, had added this verse to the call for prayer: “I testify that ʿAlí
> is the servant of Baqiyatuʾlláh as has been sent down from the hidden Tab-
> let.” The divines of the city heard of this incident and gathered to issue a
> ruling against these two Imám-Jumʿihs, namely, the honored [Mullá Sádiq]
> Muqaddas and the honored Mullá Muhammad-ʿAlí [Quddús]. These two
> esteemed personages were seized by the authorities and subjected to punish-
ment, including burning of their beards and expulsion from the city.

The oﬃcials were eager to seize the Representative of the Imám (i.e., the
> Báb). When He returned from Mecca, I was in Búshihr. Day and night I
> would attain His august presence. All His time was devoted to the revela-
> tion of verses and prayers. One night it was the opportune moment for me
> to fervently and tearfully beseech Him to pray on my behalf that I would
have a good end. He responded, “Your end is good.”

During this period of stay in Búshihr, my late father related two or three
> miracles from Him. During the days prior to His declaration, when He was
> engaged in trading in Búshihr, He would frequently come to the home of
my late father and would shower him with His favors.

His condition was most diﬀerent from that of others. I do not recall His
> smiling. I do not recall His exact utterances that I might record the same.
> In one of His Tablets, it is revealed, “All things will perish, except those
> that turned [in this Direction].” And He also stated, “Our kinsmen have
> been reckoned among the Letters of the Exalted. But not because they were
> deserving, nay, because of Our love for them.” In the course of the next
> Manifestation, this matter was inquired of His [i.e., Baháʾuʾlláh’s] presence.
> He responded, “By ʿAfnánʾ, it is meant the kinsmen of the Primal Point,
may the spirit of all be a sacriﬁce unto Him.”

The family members at the time when the [above-mentioned] blessed
> Tablet was revealed consisted of: my late father and his children; the late
> Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí, who was martyred in Tihrán, and had a son who has
> passed away; the late Hájí Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí and his children; the late Hájí
> Mírzá Abúʾl-Qásim<11> and his two sisters and children; the late Mírzá
> Siyyid Hasan<10> and some of his children; the late Áqá Mírzá Zaynuʾl-
> ʿAbidín and his son<24>; the late Mírzá Muhammad-Husayn, who came
> to Yazd and passed away there; and the late Mírzá ʿAlí-Akbar who was
> martyred in Baghdad. Him Whom God has purposed [i.e., ʿAbduʾl-Bahá]
> has numbered some of the descendants as Afnán as well, though this is
> solely a divine grace and favor.

> When Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad returned to Shíráz, he fell under
> the suspicion attached to all the members of the Báb’s family, despite his

> shortly after the departure of the Báb for Isfahán, the family felt the threat

> of the Báb’s Writings.424 The repressive environment only became more
> restrictive and arduous with the passage of time. However, the real dif-
> ﬁculty must have remained trying to determine the exact nature of the

attain the presence of Baháʾuʾlláh in Baghdad and ask his questions.425

In a Tablet dated 27 Muharram AH 1306 [3 October 1888] revealed
> in honor of Áqá Mírzá ʿAbduʾl-Hamíd Shírází, Baháʾuʾlláh recounts the
visit of the uncle of the Báb:

> The Kitáb-i Íqán was revealed in ʿIraq especially for the honored Afnán, the
> illustrious Khál Akbar, upon him rest all My Glory. The details are thus:
> After he had attained the ʿAtabát and completed his pilgrimage, he arrived
> in Baghdad. The exalted Hájí Siyyid Javád, upon him be the Glory of God,
> came into Our presence and said, “Two of the uncles of the Báb, may the
> spirit of all be a sacriﬁce unto Him, currently have arrived in this city and
> soon will depart for Shíráz.” We inquired, “Hast thou spoken with them
> about this Cause?” And he responded negatively. Upon hearing this response,
> We were saddened and said unto him, “Go and convey the greetings of this
> Wronged-One to them and say further, ‘Though We have not previously
cherished meeting with others, We do desire meeting with you.ʾ”

The illustrious Javád completed the entrusted mission and that afternoon
> returned forthwith with the celebrated Khál Akbar, who was able to attain
> Our presence. We said unto him, “It is hard for this Wronged-One to
> see that thou and the other members of the Afnán family have remained
> deprived of the Sacred Tree that hath appeared and ﬂourished amongst
> you.” He responded, “There are certain considerations that have prevented
> us from such acceptance.” We made reply, “What are those things that have
> caused you to hold back from the Exalted Horizon and the recognition of
the Sacred Tree? Present your questions.”

The following day he returned, and single and alone We met with him
> in the inner quarters of the House, and at that time he spoke those ques-

> were revealed from the heaven of the Divine Will. That beloved and other
friends of course know such details.

On another day he came into Our presence and said, “Ill-fated is the one
who would peruse this Book, and yet fail in his belief.”426

> As part of his eﬀorts in the 1950s and 1960s to organize and classify the
> Afnán family papers, Abúʾl-Qásim Afnán located the actual two sheets
> of paper penned by the uncle of the Báb and presented to Baháʾuʾlláh.
> A facsimile of this document was given to Muhammad-ʿAlí Fayzí who
> published the same in Khándán Afnán, pages 41ﬀ. The following is a
> translation of the questions of the Khál Akbar, which occasioned the
revelation of the Kitáb-i Íqán:427

> One: What previously was believed is that the promised resurrection will take
> place in another world. The raising of the dead, the Bridge, the reckoning
> of the deeds of all creatures, and the reward or punishment of those deeds
> will take place in that world. However, [the Bábís claim that] it is all in this
> world, and it has taken place. Moreover, the days of the advent of every
> Manifestation of the True One constitute that same Day of Resurrection for
> the period preceding it. In this new Revelation, there has been no punish-
> ment for man’s deeds. Nay, the insurgence and corruption of the people of
> tyranny and oppression have increased, even if the real meaning of reward
> and punishment is nearness or remoteness from the Divine Court. This
> subject is the same, regardless of which world it occurs in. The People of
> Truth in this world, since they exist in God’s good pleasure, are in a state of
> fortune; but they are outwardly caught in the grip of the people of oppression
> and are persecuted by them. The people of oppression, although they are
> tormented by being far from the threshold of God, are outwardly in state
> of comfort and by reason of their ignorance are unaware of that torment.
> If the requital for men’s deeds and the promised reward and punishment be
> as described above, and there be no other world than this one, where will
> the oppressed seek vengeance from the one who oppressed him, and where
> will the people of punishment receive their justice? This is naught but a
> denial of the promised resurrection. I have not fathomed this subject fully,
> yet it is among the most important of matters to understand.
> Two: From the inception of Islam until now, it has been a belief of all the
> followers of the Shiʿi religion—a matter that no one has ever denied or even

> guided mankind. I would ask You to favor me with a clear explanation of
> this topic, in such a manner that it will create certainty in men’s hearts,
> that no one will be able to open up a path of doubt.
> Four: According to those Traditions that have come down to us from the
> sanctiﬁed Imáms concerning the time of the appearance of the Qáʾim, such
> as: “An enemy will raise an army in Syria and will battle Him at a place
> whose name They have speciﬁed as being between Syria and Mecca”; “The
> land shall be divided in two”; “An army of eight hundred thousand shall
> descend all together upon the land, except for two men, who shall remain
> behind”; “They shall go to the army of the Qáʾim and give him tidings”;
> “Then He [the Qáʾim] shall rule and shall make Kufa His capital”; “The
> size of His army shall be so great that they will demolish the mosque of
> Kufa and shall build a new one with one thousand doors”; etc. There are
> many such accounts in the reliable books of Traditions. Yet, not one of these
> things has happened. I beseech You to provide a full explanation of this

> We are fortunate that a letter from the uncle addressed to his son, the
> Vakíluʾd-Dawlih, and written only a few days after the revelation of the
> Kitáb-i Íqán, has survived. This letter is dated 17 January 1861, and
> based on its date we can place the time of revelation of the Kitáb-i Íqán
> in early January 1861.428

Shoghi Eﬀendi, God Passes By, p. 138, has placed the revelation of the Kitáb-i Íqán
about a year later in AH 1278 or AD 1862.

O the best of the Protectors!

> To the city of Yazd, Saráy Khán, to be presented to my esteemed son,
> Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Taqí, the Shírází merchant, may he be ever-pros-
perous!

Loving light of mine eye, more precious to me than my soul, may God
> continue to enrich your life! I hope that you have lived under the care of
> the Almighty God and have been protected from all ills and wickedness,
> and have been auspicious in all your endeavors. If you wonder over our
> state, praise be to God and to His chosen Ones, on the night of the ﬁrst
> of Rajab [12 January 1861] we attained the threshold of the Shrines of the
> twin Imáms at Kázimayin, upon them be a thousand, thousand salutations
> and blessings. Your place was indeed empty. On your behalf, we oﬀered
> pilgrimage and prayers. God willing, the day after next, that is, on the
seventh of the month, we will depart this location.

We had a joyful journey en route, and snow did not fall during our
> travels, except for one night, and it rained for two days. However, we were
indoors, and the cold was not intolerable and caused no harm.

Praised be God, for what I have to write to you is that we attained unto
> the presence of His Holiness Bahá, upon Him be God’s peace. Your place
> was indeed empty. He showered us with the utmost aﬀection and kindness,
> and asked that we stay for the night, and we remained in His presence.
> The evident truth is that to be deprived of the blessing of His presence is
> a mighty and evident loss. May God bestow His grace upon us so that we
might everlastingly attain unto the blessing of His presence.

Kindly convey our greetings to the exalted Hájí Muhammad-Ibráhím;429

> his place is indeed empty. Also convey our best wishes to all the honored
friends. Peace be upon you!

5 Rajab AH 1277 [17 January 1861]
> The Kitáb-i Íqán, revealed in space of two days and nights by Baháʾuʾlláh,
> was initially known as the Risálih-i Khálawiyyih [The Treatise for the
> Uncle], but was later changed by Baháʾuʾlláh to its present title. The very
> copy of the Kitáb-i Íqán given to the uncle was in the hand of ʿAbduʾl-
> Bahá, and only in a few margins had Baháʾuʾlláh added comments or
> made alterations in His own hand. The Afnán family presented that copy
> to Shoghi Eﬀendi, and it is now displayed at the Baháʾí International

mostly through his eﬀorts the Afnáns of Yazd converted to the Baháʾí Faith.

In summation, it seems reasonable, therefore, to conclude that the
> purpose of the Kitáb-i Íqán was not to convert the uncle of the Báb, as
> he was already a believer. Rather, its goal was to disclose the full station
> of the young Prophet to the uncle and to enable him to see in the Báb
the same power and majesty as manifested by all the Prophets of old.

Subsequent to his meeting with Baháʾuʾlláh, the uncle of the Báb pro-
> ceeded to the ʿAtabát and, after having met with his sister, returned to
> Shíráz. There the believers came to meet him and to inquire of what had
> transpired in Baghdad. Upon meeting with Núriʾd-Dín, the Khál Akbar
> asked the former to also enlighten his sons as to the true station of the
> Báb as an independent Manifestation of God. Eventually, in the fall of
> 1866, Nabíl Aʿzam was instructed to proclaim the new Cause of Baháʾuʾlláh
> throughout the length and breadth of Iran. His arrival precipitated the
> conversion of the Khál Akbar and the remaining members of the Afnán
family in Shíráz to the Baháʾí Faith.431

The last question that remains to be answered is: In addition to the
> family’s claim as reported above, is there any evidence from the Khál
> himself to suggest that he actually believed in Baháʾuʾlláh? And if so, did
> he recognize in Him the Promised One of the Bayánic Dispensation? To
> answer these questions, we can do no better than to turn to the words of
the uncle of the Báb in his own ﬁnal will and testament:432

In the Name of God, the Glorious, the Most Glorious.

> These few words are written as my will in the middle of Dhiʾl-Qaʿdih AH
1291 [Circa 24 December 1874].

First, I testify to the oneness and singleness of God. He is sanctiﬁed and
> supreme from having a partner. I further testify that the exalted and hallowed
> Person Who declared Himself in AH 1260 [1844] is indeed in the truth
> and manifested the glory and ascendancy of the Almighty God. Whatsoever
> He decreed in His religion and all that He revealed of the divine spiritual
> stations, are all the manifest truth, and whosoever obeyed Him is among
> those that were saved, and those that opposed Him indeed rank as ones
> who have perished. Today, the one true religion of God is that which His
> Holiness [the Báb] ordained. And further, today, the author of the Dispensa-
> tion and the succor of this luminous community is the exalted and elevated
> Bahá, may my spirit and the spirit of the world be a sacriﬁce unto Him.
> His Manifestation is the same as the Báb’s Manifestation. Obedience unto
> Him, is obedience unto God, and opposing Him, is opposing God.

Immersed in an ocean of sin, because of the inﬁrmities of self, this servant
> concealed his convictions from all, even from his children and kinsmen. But
> now I have committed them to paper so that after my passing they become
> aware and strive to perceive the matter. God willing, they too will number
among those who believed.

I ask those who may come upon these pages, whether of my children or
> kinsmen, or of others, that after my passing, in accordance with the laws of
> the Bayán, they prepare me for burial by washing and wrapping [my body]
> in cloth. And if I was in Shíráz, to bury my remains there. . . . And should

> bury me anywhere that is possible, whether inside or outside the city. And
> should I pass away somewhere other than in Shíráz, then wherever I have
expired, bury me at that spot.

Of earthly possessions, let it be known that I have none that would

not able to do so, then they know best.

At the time of the writing of these pages, God is aware that if I were
> to list the furniture of the house and other possessions, it would add to

> gradually a third of it has been mortgaged to Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí.
Let this be known to all. Peace.

There are some monies owed me, but these remain beyond collection.

APPENDIX FIVE

THE PATERNAL GENEALOGY OF THE BÁB

> In this appendix a brief biography of the paternal members of the Báb’s
> family will be given. Few of the Báb’s paternal relatives became Bábís or
> believed in Baháʾuʾlláh. However, several of His relatives played signiﬁcant
> roles in Bábí and Baháʾí history.

> Siyyid Mírzá Muhammad-Ridá
> The father of the Báb was the son and grandson of retail merchants.434 He
> owned a dry goods shop in the Bazaar Vakíl, a family business that had
> existed since the eighteenth century, and he had a house in the Bazaar
> Murgh district, the neighborhood where most of the Shíráz merchants
> lived. He married well, into the family of established wholesale import/
> export merchants. He had several children prior to the Báb, but none
> survived. His only surviving child was the Báb. He was forty-nine when
> he died. The Báb was probably nine at the time, although other accounts

> Khúshnivis [calligrapher]. Mírza Mahmúd in turn had three sons: Mírzá Muhammad-

> this city that he met the Báb on several occasions and became an ardent

> the most prominent student of Shaykh Murtidá, who was acknowledged
as the leading mujtahid of the Shiʿih world.

When Shaykh Murtidá died, Mírzáy-i Shírází succeeded him as teacher
> of his circle of students. He went on pilgrimage to Mecca in 1871. Over
> the next few years, his stature among the other ʿulamá increased to the

> became acknowledged as the sole Marjaʿ Taqlíd. He is also called Hujjatuʾl-
> Islám [the Proof of Islam], Ayatuʾlláh [the Sign of God], and Mujaddid
> [Renewer] by his biographers. In 1875, Mírzáy-i Shírází transferred his
> residence to Samarrá and remained there until his death, making this
provincial shrine city for a time a center of scholarship.435

In 1891–92 there occurred the famous protest against the Tobacco
> Régie. As a result of a fatwá,436 ﬁrst written and circulated by Hájí Mírzá
> Hasan Áshtiyání, but in December 1891 endorsed by Mírzáy-i Shírází,
> the Government of Iran and the foreign diplomatic establishment were
> amazed to observe an almost complete cessation of the use of tobacco. The
> Sháh was forced to capitulate, and the tobacco concession was cancelled.
> This incident proved to be a forerunner of the Constitutional Revolt of
a decade later.

Mírzáy-i Shírází died on 20 February 1895, and his body was carried
> from Samarrá to Najaf, where it was buried. Subsequent to his passing,
> prayer vigils were held for him throughout Iran, and Násiriʾd-Dín Sháh
> attended the one held in Tihrán.437

> Hájí Siyyid Javád Shirází
> He was a paternal relative of the Báb’s father and studied in ʿIraq and

He was the teacher of Shaykhuʾr-Raʾís, a Qájár Prince who was a leading voice for
reform in Iran and who is mentioned considerably in this volume.

> somewhat daring subject for a man of his class, attracted many students,
> including Shaykh Hádí Sabzivarí, the foremost Iranian philosopher of
the nineteenth century.438

His chief rival in Kirmán was the Shaykhí leader, Hájí Muhammad-
> Karím Khán. When Quddús came to Kirmán in 1845 to announce the
> religion of the Báb to the Shaykhí leader, he stayed with Hájí Siyyid Javád
> who readily embraced the new Faith.439 Later he intervened on behalf of
> two Bábí teachers, Mullá Sádiq Khurásání and Mullá Yúsuf Ardabilí, when
> they were attacked in Kirmán. He passed away in AH 1287 [1870].

> prior to his own passing in AH 1276 [1859]. He was a merchant but
> later retired to become a farmer.

> Mírzá ʿAlí-Akbar
> A second cousin of the Báb, he was a devoted believer and a close com-

> (and Dayyán) was murdered in Baghdad at the instigation of Mírzá Yahyá
> Azal, and Baháʾuʾlláh makes a reference to him in His Epistle to the Son
> of the Wolf and in yet another Tablet.440

Bástaní-Párizí, Kuchih Haft Pích, ch. 3, states that Sabzivarí desired the tutelage of
> Siyyid Javád to such a degree that on foot he traveled from his native Khurásán to Kir-
> mán, and when he arrived the period of enrollment for the Siyyid’s class was completed.
> Undaunted, Sabzivarí took a job as a janitor in that building, married the daughter of
> the building’s custodian, and stayed for the next six months to partake of these lectures.
> The same source further states that Siyyid Javád would commence his annual classes on
> the ﬁrst day of the Fall by reciting the opening two verses of Rúmí’s Mathnaví, and then
> spending the next six months oﬀering unsurpassed analysis and expositions, concluding
his last lecture on the day before Naw-Rúz.

One of the Bábís of Kirmán has left behind a large account of Quddús’ visit to that
> city, entitled Kitábuʾl-Quddúsiyyih, which the present translator has rendered into English
and which will soon appear in print.

APPENDIX SIX

THE AFNÁN FAMILY:
SOME BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES

> In the Writings of Baháʾuʾlláh, the term ʿAfnán’ is used to refer to the
> maternal family of the Báb. A deﬁnition is given in the following Tablet,
> revealed in honor of the martyred Mírzá ʿAlí-Muhammad Varqá (d.
1896):

> In response to your question about the meaning of the terms ‘Aghsán’ and
> ‘Afnánʾ, when the Supreme Pen hath mentioned the Afnán, We have intended
> the descendants of the Primal Point. Verily, in this Dispensation, all have
> been summoned to the Most Exalted Horizon and guided to the Most Great
> Ocean. At the beginning of Our Days, a special prayer was revealed for the
> Afnán, which ordained that they would be faithful to the Manifestation of
> God and recognize Him. God willing, they will arise to fulﬁl what hath
> been decreed for them and will remain ﬁrm and steadfast in the Cause of
> God. Blessed are those whom We have called by this name, Afnán. Ver-
> ily, the sweet fragrance of the All-Merciful hath been wafted from them.
> Moreover, We have established them as twigs of Our own Tree. Verily, this
> is Our favor upon them. We beseech God to protect them from the traces
> of the pen and the veils of knowledge. We have bestowed this gift on some
> in the Book, the contents of which are concealed from all save the Lord
> of Creation. Soon what hath been ordained for them by the Almighty, the
> All-knowing, will appear.441

> The term ‘Afnán’ is the plural of the word fanán, which in Arabic refers
> to a straight and verdant branch. In the Qurʾán’s Surih of Rahmán (the
> Merciful), the term was used to describe the celestial dwelling of the
> righteous. This dwelling has two heavenly trees, one of which is called ‘the
Afnán.ʾ442 Similarly, Islamic Traditions refer to a ﬁrm branch.443

The ﬁrst genealogy of the Báb’s family was oﬀered at the beginning
of The Dawn-Breakers by Shoghi Eﬀendi. The following table provides

Qurʾán 55:46–47.

> The following is a brief biographical sketch of the consanguineous members
> of the Afnán family who are mentioned in this volume or are of some
> other historical interest.444 The notes are in numerical order and use the
> same numbering system as the genealogy chart.

> <1> Mírzá ʿAbid
> A son of Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad. He was known as Mírzá Zaynuʾl-
> ʿAbidín.

> <2> Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad Husayn
> The Báb’s maternal grandfather.

> <3> Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí
> He was a wholesale merchant involved in importing and exporting through
> Shíráz and its port of Búshihr. He was married to Hájíyyih Bíbí.

> <4> Fátimih Bagum
> The mother of the Báb. She came from a well-known and highly respected
> cloth merchant family in Shíráz that traced its ancestry to Imám Husayn.
> She married Siyyid Muhammad-Ridá, a member of another merchant
> family from Shíráz. They had several children who did not survive. The
> only child to live to adulthood was Siyyid ʿAlí-Muhammad, the Báb<12>,
> who was born on 20 October 1819. When Fátimih Bagum’s husband died
> a few years later, she went to live in the house of her brother, Hájí Mírzá
> Siyyid ʿAlí<7>, who acted as her Son’s guardian. In 1842, she arranged
> for the marriage of her Son to Khadíjih Bagum<9> and lived with them

family.

According to Nabíl Aʿzam, before the Báb left Shíráz, He prepared His
> will and bequeathed the estate to His mother and His wife, with the whole
reverting to His wife, Khadíjih Bagum, when His mother died.446

News of her Son reached Fátimih Bagum only sporadically. When He
> was executed in Tabríz in 1850, the family kept the news from her for
> more than a year. The grief of the news and the hostility of friends and
> some family members ﬁnally caused her to move to Karbalá in Rabíʿuʾl-
> Avval AH 1268 [December 1851]. She took with her: Hájí Mubárak, the
> Ethiopian servant of the Báb purchased in Búshihr; Bíbí Gawhar, aunt of
> the Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih<99>; and her own mother.447 Later, Hájí ʿAbduʾl-
> Majíd and his wife, who were both Bábís, joined her. During this period,
> the family worried about her living in the ʿAtabát and, on at least one
> occasion, Khajídih Bagum considered visiting her. When she consulted
> Baháʾuʾlláh about this, He said: “In response to your letter stating that
> the mother of the Exalted One, may the spirit of all be a sacriﬁce to
> Him, wants you to travel to that land [Karbalá], know that this is most
> pleasing. Should you undertake this journey, it will assuredly be a source
of happiness for her.”448

Up to this time, Fátimih Bagum was not a Bábí. Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh<71>
> reports Baháʾuʾlláh’s stating that Mírzá Yahyá Azal’s action in marrying
> the Báb’s second wife drove Fátimih Bagum away from accepting the
> Faith. While Baháʾuʾlláh was in Baghdad, He arranged for the wife of
> Hájí ʿAbduʾl-Majíd and for Hájí Siyyid Javád Karbaláʾí, an old friend of
> Fátimih Bagum’s family, to speak to her about the Faith.449 Eventually,
> she became a believer. She continued to live in Karbalá until her death
> in about 1881.

In the Qayyumuʾl-Asmáʾ, Surih 28, the Báb refers to Fátimih Bagum
> as Ummuʾl-Muʾminin [mother of the believers] and Ummuʾdh-Dhikr
> [mother of the Remembrance]. Baháʾuʾlláh refers to her as Khayruʾn-Nisa
> [the best of women] and forbids all others, except Khadíjih Bagum, from
adopting this title.450

One of the objectives of the Ten Year Crusade was to locate the grave of
Fátimih Bagum. Thus far, the Iraq Baháʾís have not been able to do so.

> <5> Hájí Mírzá Siyyid Muhammad
> The oldest of the Báb’s maternal uncles and the recipient of the Kitáb-i
Íqán. He was also known as Khál Akbar [great uncle].

Khál Akbar was born in 1798 and was a merchant. His wife, Hájíyyih
> Bíbí Fátimih-Sáhib, was a daughter of Hájí Muhammad-Muhsin and a
> member of another prominent merchant family trading in Shíráz and
> Búshihr. Khál Akbar ran the family oﬃce in Búshihr. The Báb was closely
> associated with him during the ﬁrst four years He worked as a merchant
there.

Several years before the Báb’s declaration, Khál Akbar was concerned
> that the Báb’s preoccupation with religious matters would create problems.
> Later, he met Mullá ʿAlí Bastámí, whom the Báb had sent as a messenger,
> and began to have a change of heart. The Báb stayed with him when He
> passed through Búshihr on His pilgrimage journey. On His return, the
> Báb stayed with him once more, arriving on 15 May 1845 and staying
> for 10 days before leaving for Shíráz. It seems that during this time the
> uncle recognized in the Báb unrivalled spiritual powers. When Khál Akbar
> returned to Shíráz, he fell under the suspicion attached to all members of
the Báb’s family, despite his outward protestations of orthodoxy.

In the late 1850s, the young Áqá Mírzá Áqá<24> began urging Khál
> Akbar to renew his commitment to the Bábí Faith and accept the Báb
> as the promised Qáʾim. Since his sister, the Báb’s mother, was living in
> Karbalá, he agreed to visit Baháʾuʾlláh while passing through Baghdad.
> He was received by Baháʾuʾlláh in early January 1861. At Baháʾuʾlláh’s
> request, he wrote out the questions that disturbed him about why the
> Báb had not literally fulﬁlled Islamic prophecies.451 Over the next two
> days and nights, Baháʾuʾlláh revealed the Kitáb-i Íqán in reply. After this,
> Khál Akbar became fully aware of the Báb’s station.

Vakíluʾd-Dawlih<13> notes that around 1840, Siyyid ʿAlí retired from

Hájí Mírzá Siyyid ʿAlí became a Bábí in June 1845 through the eﬀorts

three months.

After the Báb left Shíráz, Khál Aʿzam tried to shield the Báb’s wife

> the Tabarsí conﬂict had ended by the time he reached Bárfurúsh, so he
went to Tihrán.

Khál Aʿzam lived in the capital for a time at the house of Muhammad

A second Tablet by Baháʾuʾlláh in honor of Zahrá Bagum reads:

of God, the Most Glorious.

He is Governor over the Supreme Horizon!

God, and His bounty and His mercy, in both the heavens and the earth!

You have endured in the path of God that which hath caused the hearts

hear its cry and lamentation.

The station that the Supreme Pen hath decreed for the Afnáns is the

> <9> Khadíjih Bagum
> The wife of the Báb. She is occasionally referred to as Khadíjih-Sultán
Bagum.

Khadíjih Bagum was a cousin of the Báb’s mother. Marriages to cous-

As explained in previous chapters, Baháʾuʾlláh bestowed the custodian-
ship of the House of the Báb on Khadíjih Bagum:

Baháʾuʾlláh.

> In the Name of God, the Ruler, the Wise, the Ever-present Fashioner of
the heavens and the earth.

O you the near ones in Sh[íráz]! Under all conditions, the Supreme Pen
> hath testiﬁed and always will: God is Single, the One, the Almighty, the All-
> powerful, the All-conquering, the Omnipotent. He doeth as He pleaseth and
ordaineth whatever He willeth. He is the Compassionate, the Generous!

We have bestowed the custodianship of the Blessed House upon the
> exalted leaf, the wife of the Primal Point, and her sister, upon them rest
> the glory of God and His mercy and His favor. God hath granted the cus-
> todianship for this House. Verily, He is adorned with the robe of generos-

> Beloved. From her Lord, the Merciful, this honor and benevolence hath
> been bestowed upon the sister and her descendants. He is the Muniﬁcent

Rabíʿuʾl-Avval AH 1301 (3 January 1884):

> The honored Afnáns,465 upon them rest all My glory, the Most Glorious,
> arrived in Beirut and, afterwards, by Our leave, gradually and individually
> arrived here. Having entered the canopy of Our favors and might, one by
> one they returned. Regarding what had happened, they stated that their plan
> was that, after arriving in Beirut, Siyyid ʿAlí would return to Sh[íráz] to
> accompany the exalted leaf to this land of God. They stated that they had
> designed the plan in this way because they feared going to Sh[íráz] any earlier
> might provoke the foes and enemies to act and prevent all from attaining
> Our presence. It was even asserted that, despite such caution, the enemies
> caused disturbances along the way; but creation, protection, and liberty are
> all in the hands of God, and He is the All-bountiful, the All-generous. In
> short, such excuses were heard from one after another. But the Lord hath
knowledge of all things; He is the All-knowing, the All-informed.

Nevertheless, it would have been best [if they had] carried out the wishes
> of the illustrious exalted leaf, as this was most pleasing and acceptable to
> God; but it was otherwise ordained. The One True God is My witness! Our
> heart hath melted in agony that she was deprived of this pilgrimage, and all
> the dwellers under the tabernacle of purity and might are most sorrowful
> and despondent. At one point, the Tongue of Grandeur spoke these exalted
> words: “O ʿAbd-i Hadir![ever-present servant] The eﬀect of what hath hap-
> pened may well appear on earth.” More recently, this utterance was spoken
> by His blessed Tongue: “Write to My Afnán [who had promised to escort
> the Báb’s wife] that we agreed and consented to the exalted leaf ’s request.
> Currently, the honored persons continue to stand ready and prepared to
> fulﬁl that promise, though they have not spoken of it.” He further stated,
> “Write of this matter to the Afnán, upon him be the glory of God, as he
> was well aware of such a promise beforehand. We desired to fulﬁl what We
> had assured the exalted leaf.”466

ness of the resting-place of Khadíjih Bagum:

O Afnán of the Tree beyond which there is no passing and of the friends

of that sanctiﬁed altar.

Concerning the sacred, fragrant, and resplendent sepulcher of the illus-

> He was born in 1830 in Shíráz. After completing his studies at age 15,

All the Afnáns had oﬃces in the Saray-i Khajih and controlled the city’s

> “These men are indeed heavenly angels. They are worthy of their station
> as descendants of the Prophet of Islam. We are not concerned with their
[current] beliefs because of their holy lineage.”

The honored Hájí Mírzá Hasan-ʿAlí, who was an uncle of the Báb, would
> frequently attend the mosque and oﬀer [Muslim] prayers. His three sons,
> Hájí Mírzá Áqá, Hájí Siyyid Mihdí, and Hájí Siyyid Husayn, each had a
> magniﬁcent oﬃce, were pillars of commerce and employed a large staﬀ
> of secretaries, accountants, attendants, and others. Despite their immense
> wealth and attainments, they were nevertheless very lowly and humble. It
was truly astonishing and bewildering.

One of them was the honored Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-Taqí, the Vakíluʾd-
> Dawlih, the oﬃcial representative of the Russian government. He had won
> a special medal and displayed a ﬂag over his house. Indeed, he was more
> accomplished than the others. He conducted himself with such tranquility,

> passion, love, and equity, that when he passed through the streets, all the
> pedestrians would pause and, with great respect, defer to him, often bowing
> low before him. When a dispute took place between the merchants, they
> invariably would consider his word the ﬁnal say and deciding factor. The

> several of the principal merchants happened to be his guests in his oﬃce. For

was almost complete.479

In mid-1900, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá wrote to him conﬁdentially about the
> troubles that surrounded Him in the Holy Land and instructed him to
form the Universal House of Justice in the event of His slaying:

> As to ʿAbduʾl-Bahá, He is now in very great danger, beset by countless grave

> and gather the Afnán of the divine Lote-Tree together. By this is meant that
> you must unite them in spirit and purpose, and let them join in harmony
> and concord with the Hands of the Cause, so that the Universal House
> of Justice may be formed as far as this is practicable and the provisions of
> the Will and Testament can be implemented when this is necessary. It is
> incumbent upon the Afnán of the holy Tree to stand in the forefront and
> to shield and protect the mighty stronghold of the Cause of God. In this
> way, they will become the recipients of such favors as will beneﬁt the station

A short but important biography of the Vakíluʾd-Dawlih was written by Charles

See Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, pp. 118–25. One of the notebooks of the Vakíluʾd-

> Vakíluʾd-Dawlih’s correspondence with Siyyid Muhammad, a son of Mírzáy-i Shírází, is
in the private hands of his descendants.

It is noted in his biography in Fasáʾí, Fársnámih Násirí, vol. 2, p. 45, that, due to
> economic depression in Fárs and family bankruptcy, Hájí Mírzá Muhammad-ʿAlí went
> to China for 10 years. There, he became the main contact for the opium trade of the
> merchants of Isfahán, Yazd, and Fárs. In the Writings of Baháʾuʾlláh, he is referred to as
“the Afnán in China.” See Baháʾuʾlláh’s Tablet in Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, p. 83.

He married his maternal cousin, daughter of Hájí ʿAbduʾl-Husayn.

See ʿAbduʾl-Bahá, Memorials of the Faithful, pp. 16–21.

The news of this achievement was communicated on 14 June 1959 by the Hands

one of those who believed.

Áqá Mírzá Áqá was a merchant, trading in partnership with other

> the name Núriʾd-Dín Hasan and organized the Rúhaniyyih Company. In
> July 1891 at Baháʾuʾlláh’s invitation, he and his family came to the Holy
> Land, where they stayed for nine months. During this period, Baháʾuʾlláh
revealed the Tablet of the World in his honor. It states:

> O Afnán, O thou that has branched from Mine ancient Stock! My glory
and My loving-kindness rest upon thee.

How vast is the tabernacle of the Cause of God! It hath overshadowed
> all the peoples and kindreds of the earth, and will, ere long, gather together
> the whole of mankind beneath its shelter. Thy day of service is now come.
> Countless Tablets bear the testimony of the bounties vouchsafed unto you.
> Arise for the triumph of My Cause and, through the power of thine utter-
> ance, subdue the hearts of men. Thou must show forth that which will
> ensure the peace and the well-being of the miserable and the downtrodden.
> Gird up the loins of thine endeavor, that perchance thou mayest release the
> captive from his chains, and enable him to attain unto true liberty.492

> A little more than a year after Áqá Mírzá Áqá returned to Egypt, ʿAbduʾl-
> Bahá instructed him to go to Shíráz to defend the Baháʾí Faith against
> the Covenant-breakers there. He went to Yazd with the Vakíluʾd-Dawlih

> In 1901, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá told Núriʾd-Dín to return to Shíráz in order to
> restore the House of the Báb. Núriʾd-Dín had been its custodian since the
> death of his mother in 1889. At the time of his passing on 15 November
> 1903, the work was nearly completed. His son, Mírzá Habíbuʾlláh, suc-
ceeded him as custodian.

Núriʾd-Dín left behind a valuable daily journal, a page of which is
translated below:

> Tonight is the eve of 27 Ramadán AH 1286 [31 December 1869], and the
> friends came to meet with Áqá Mírzá Mihdí Rashtí. He came some time
> ago to teach the Faith but, because of troubles and fear of harassment, was
> unable to meet with the believers. We came together to spend the whole
evening in fellowship, discussion, and prayer.

As I write these lines, it is now midnight, and, because of the uproars
> [against the Baháʾís], there is no hope that any of us will see daybreak.
> However, we are immersed in such warm love and spirituality that [my]
pen is unable to describe it.

These trials and tribulations will strengthen the resolve of the friends.

> Soon, the believers will be seen to organize, unhindered, meetings where
> chanting of the divine verses will be raised and His praise and acclaim
> heard uninterrupted. However, will those future believers know the same
> spirituality that we felt? By God, never! This ethereal spirituality is born
> from the ﬁre of persecution and is the result of enduring anguish and harm
> in His path.

> <25> Hájí Siyyid Mírzá
> Initially based in Yazd and later in India, he engaged in trade extending
> from China to Europe and amassed a considerable fortune. During the days
> of Baháʾuʾlláh, he carried out many services, such as acting as contact with
> the Holy Land, and was deeply respected by the believers. When Mírzá
> Muhammad-ʿAlí raised his rebellion and was joined by Siyyid ʿAlí<28>
> in opposition to the Center of the Covenant, Siyyid Mírzá threw in his
> lot with them. He decided to journey to ʿIshqábád to stir the believers
> against ʿAbduʾl-Bahá, but his brother, Siyyid Ahmad<26>, prevented him.
> During this period, Siyyid Mírzá’s children severed relations with him.
> The painful decision to make this separation was spearheaded by Mírzá
> ʿAbduʾl-Husayn<77>, who even separated his business dealings from his
> father’s. In no time, Siyyid Mírzá’s vast fortune was completely depleted.
> Through the eﬀort of the Vakíluʾd-Dawlih, Siyyid Mírzá soon realized the
> error of his ways and was deeply repentant. He asked for ʿAbduʾl-Bahá’s

> 1903 pogrom of the Baháʾís in Yazd, he was a pillar of faith for the com-
> munity and greatly assisted the believers that suﬀered through that ordeal.
> He passed away as a steadfast Baháʾí in Yazd a year later. Hájí Siyyid Mírzá
> had married Sárá-Sultán Bagum<43> and they had ﬁve children.

> <26> Siyyid Ahmad
> A brother to Hájí Siyyid Mírzá<25>. Siyyid Ahmad was a merchant, living
for a while in Yazd and then in ʿIshqábád, busied with commerce.

He was a deeply devoted believer who traveled to ʿAkká to see
> Baháʾuʾlláh. While there, he learned that he was being accused of theft
> in Istanbul. He hurried to that city and suﬀered bitterly at the hands
> of the foes, including an enemy of the Baháʾí Faith by the name of
> Muhammad-ʿAlí Isfahání. However, he was able to prove his innocence
> and establish their slander.495 In one of Baháʾuʾlláh’s Tablets, He says about
> this event, “There were several tormentors in Istanbul who perpetrated
> great harm on the honored Afnán, Áqá Siyyid Ahmad. Since the honored
> Afnán was meek and gentle, these men manifested the greatest oppres-
> sion, spoke disreputable slanders, and incited other lowlifes and ruﬃans
against him.”496

After this incident, Siyyid Ahmad again attained the presence of
> Baháʾuʾlláh in ʿAkká and stayed until after His ascension. Subsequently,
> he traveled to promote the Baháʾí Faith and once more returned to ʿAkká,
where the Master showered His favors on him.

In 1899, he went to ʿIshqábád and from there to Yazd, where he estab-
> lished the ﬁrst Spiritual Assembly of that city.497 He eventually moved
> to Shíráz, where he was the victim of a night burglary and killed. On
> hearing the news, ʿAbduʾl-Bahá was deeply grieved and conferred upon
> him the rank of martyr.498 The Master revealed two Tablets and a Tablet
> of Visitation to mark Siyyid Ahmad’s passing.499 Siyyid Ahmad left no
> descendants.

Nabíl Zarandí refers to this incident on page 1012 of his unpublished manuscript
> and includes it as “among the recent occurrences.” This suggests that it happened at the
> same time that Nabíl was concluding his narrative, namely, circa Rabíʿuʾl-Avval AH 1308
(October 1890). See Navvabzadeh-Ardikani, Matalibí dar bárih Táríkh Nabíl Zarandí.

He was born in Shíráz in 1869 and was reared by Khadíjih Bagum. His

> weekly gatherings in their home, which were led by Mullá ʿAbduʾlláh Fádil.
> He also asked his son to look after the needs of the believers from the
> surrounding regions who visited Shíráz. Once a year, he was to visit all the
> Baháʾí communities in the province and support their activities and cheer
> their hearts. From his teens, Áqá Siyyid Áqá was constantly traveling on
> behalf of the Baháʾí Faith. He sent reports of his activities to Baháʾuʾlláh,
Who sent encouragement in numerous Tablets. One Tablet reads:522

He is the Revealer, the Wise.

> The Tongue of the Merciful saith: O My friend and son of My Afnán! The
> robe of honor hath been cut and prepared for thy temple. The Supreme
> Pen hath revealed for thee that to which no created thing can be compared.
> Wherefore, render thanks unto thy Lord that thou hast branched from God

> abasement in His Cause is indeed the source of honor and the dawning-
place of divine favor.

In truth, ere long the Almighty, the Fashioner of both worlds, will make
> manifest such matters that, were others to be apprised of them, they would
> verily circumambulate around thee. Soon, they will realize what they have
> lost, on the Day when people will arise for their Lord, the Creator of the
Worlds.

Fleeting, temporal things are not worthy of consideration. Ears were not
> made to hear them, nor eyes meant to look upon them. By God, they are
in evident loss.

The Perspicuous Book stands evident, and the Mother Book has been

> At about the same time, the Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih<99>, who was about

After ﬁve years, Áqá Siyyid Áqá left for Egypt with his father. There,

Afnán. The honored Áqá Siyyid Áqá.

He is God, the Forgiver, the Generous.

> The honored Afnán526—upon him be the peace of the Merciful—hath

O My Afnán, upon thee rest My glory! Thy station is that of guiding the
servants, so that the sincere may drink their ﬁll from the generous Hand

Literally, “bayán,” a reference to the Báb’s Revelation.

INBMC 51:348, no. 354. Also quoted in Fayzí, Khándán Afnán, pp. 220–21.

About this, Baháʾuʾlláh notes, “Recently the Afnáns and Amín—upon them be My
> glory and loving kindness—attained Our presence and beheld Our countenance; likewise
> Nabíl, the son of Nabíl, and the son of Samandar—upon them rest the glory of God and
> His loving kindness—are present and have drunk the cup of reunion. We entreat God that
> He may graciously ordain for them the good of this world and of the next and that the
> outpouring of His blessings and grace may descend upon them from the heaven of His
> generosity and the clouds of His tender compassion” (Tablets of Bahá ʾuʾlláh, pp. 73–74). In
> addition to the two Afnáns, Baháʾuʾlláh is referring to Hájí ʿAbduʾl-Hasan Amín, Shaykh
Muhammad-ʿAlí Nabíl, and Áqá Shaykh Ahmad Nabílí of Qazvín.

Presumably, a reference to Áqá Mírzá Áqá Núriʾd-Dín.

Egypt from his pilgrimage to the Holy Land:

> O wondrous oﬀshoot of the sacred Lote-Tree! I am very sorry and sad that,

Therefore, it was considered better for thee to leave.

However, at all times, I am concerned as to how such a foreign land is
treating thee. Be sure to write about the details of thy situation.

Six months ago, the two caskets arrived in Haifa after enormous diﬃcul-
> ties. No one knew their real purpose; everyone thought they were intended
for the Shrine of Baháʾuʾlláh.

After that, I sent Mírzá Asaduʾlláh, with several others, to bring the sacred
> and sanctiﬁed remains of the Báb—may My spirit and essence be a sacriﬁce
> to His dust—with the greatest care, humility, and reverence. Of them, only
> Mírzá Asaduʾlláh knew the real purpose of the mission. The others thought
> they were transporting [packages of ] Writings. That sacred trust arrived in
> Damascus and was taken to the Holy Land by carriage. It must be obvious
what immense joy and spirituality resulted from this event.

Currently, the land that was bought on Mount Carmel is being prepared.

> The Ancient Beauty, may My spirit be a sacriﬁce to His friends, always
> praised that spot and instructed that it be bought. In all their books, the
> Messengers of God have spoken of that location and given clear prophecies
[about it].

We are now busy raising that sacred Shrine and abide by the Will of God.

> Therefore, thou too must join us by oﬀering thy labor to build and construct
> this Shrine. Hasten here by any means possible and obtain this most resplen-
dent bounty. This favor is greater than all worship!

Pass on my warmest Baháʾí greetings to the holy leaf, thy grandmother,
and to the sacred leaf, thy mother, and to the other leaves of the Afnán.

Master is reported to have alluded to His own imminent passing.542

As a sign of His particular aﬃnity for the Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih, ʿAbduʾl-

He was supremely serene, remarkably composed and calm.

> rose up and spoke with exceptional eloquence in praise of the Manifestation

> of God. He was indeed a sign of the oneness of God and an ensign of the
> glorious Lord. In the school of exposition and eloquence, he was a worthy
> teacher. Those that heard him were left joyous and happy from the beauty
of his expression and words.

Continuously, his letters reached the sacred Threshold, and the Blessed
> Beauty would say with great joy, “Read the letters of Múvaqqariʾd-
> Dawlih!” Baháʾuʾlláh would soon send replies. These were evidence that
> Baháʾuʾlláh showed him great love and kindness. In fact, it could be said
> that Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih was present there in reality. Often, Baháʾuʾlláh
> addressed him in this way, “O thou who hast branched from this holy
> Tree.” Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih, in turn, always became exuberant and joyous
> from the glances of the loving kindness of the Speaker on Sinai. The news
> of his joy and excitement would always reach the Holy Land and make the
servants of God happy.

[This continued] until the Sun of Truth set from this world and shone
> from the unseen world. The news of Baháʾuʾlláh’s ascension plunged the
> Afnán into such distress and anguish that he couldnʾt speak for a while,
> and the ﬂow of his writing and exposition was stilled. Day and night, this
> companion was downcast; at dawn and in the night season, he was encom-
> passed with sorrow and tears. I wrote to him and maintained contact with
> him until he was rekindled and became reinvigorated and eager to begin
serving the Cause of God again.

For some time, he worked for the government on the coast of the Sea of
> Oman. His administration was based on justice and equity. All the towns
> and cities of the southern provinces appreciated his sagacious rule, and
> everyone lauded his eﬀorts to improve their state aﬀairs. It was universally
> said that his rule was without equal and his administration of justice without
> prejudice to anyone. During the days of his rule, his primary objective was
> to improve the living conditions of the people. At all times, his praise was
> widely sung in those areas, and all the friends would rejoice to hear news
> of him. After some time, he went to India, and in the years he lived there,
> friend and foe would proclaim, “Here is one who is the standard-bearer of
> justice and one of its shining lights.” He was supremely serene and had an
undisturbable, self-possessed calmness.

Although everyone knew that he was a Baháʾí and, indeed, was related
> to the holy Tree, the enemies of the Cause showed him great respect and
> consideration. All the great ones of Iran—traders, businessmen, and travel-
> ers—sought his company and showed him love and respect. He was indeed
> a great luminary. Some time later, they asked him to go to Tihrán, where
he met the ministers of the Iranian government.

A supplication for the progress of the soul of the Afnán of the sacred
Lote-Tree, the illustrious Múvaqqariʾd-Dawlih:
> O God, my God! How can I make mention of Thee and of the ﬁre of long-
> ing that burns in the heart of ʿAbduʾl-Bahá and the ﬂame of sorrow and loss
> that ignites His being because of the great aﬄiction that has surrounded
Thy sincere ones? O Thou the Lord of the heavens above!

Tears are pouring down, and our hearts are aﬂame because of the calamity
> that hath befallen us. On its account, the cry of lamentation and weeping
> hath been raised from the hearts of Thy loved ones and the breasts of Thy
> servants. O Lord! In Thy grace, Thou callest to Thy presence in the King-
> dom above those that have achieved certitude and have believed in Thee.
> Thou biddest them to return to the Paradise that is their true home. But
> Thou hast forsaken me, alone and desolate in this world, broken-winged
> and bereft of hope, deep in the sea of sorrows, and languishing in depriva-
tion on this earth.

O God, my God! How long wilt Thou leave me in this state of abject
> lowliness, burning with the ﬁre of separation from Thee, whilst Thou ordain-
est for those that are nigh unto Thee ascension unto the highest summit?

O God, my God! My body is melting away, my hair is white, and I have
> grown old. I have no strength to arise and serve Thy loved ones, whom Thou
hast singled out to raise Thy word and spread Thy fragrances.

O Lord, my Lord! Hasten My ascension unto Thy sublime threshold and
> My arrival in the world above and the court of Thy grace. Hasten my admit-
tance to Thy gift of forgiveness and pardon in Thine inﬁnite Kingdom.

O my God! Thy meek and humble servant, who beseeched Thee—the
> twig that had branched from the holy Tree, named Múvaqqar—hath left
> this ephemeral world and is now pleading to return to the everlasting
> world. Lord, he hastened to Thee with a hopeful heart, throbbing in Thy
> love. His tears were overﬂowing, and his patience had ended. He could no
> longer wait to meet Thee. He had believed in Thee and Thy verses. He had
> become attracted by Thy fragrances. He had become enkindled with the ﬁre
> burning in the Tree of Thy unity. He had sought comfort in Thy remem-
> brance. He was content with Thy providence and hath now hastened to Thy
> shelter.

O God! He was a bird warbling in Thy garden, a lion roaring in Thy
> forests, and a whale swimming in Thine ocean, until the world of existence
> became too narrow for him. So when the day of his destiny came, he
> returned to Thee with a heart attracted to Thee, his countenance radiant,
> tears of joy ﬂowing from him, exulting in the knowledge of Thy forgive-
ness and pardon.

O Lord! Raise his station! Ordain all good for him and grant him the
> glances of Thy favor. Immerse him in the sea of mysteries in the Kingdom

APPENDIX SEVEN

FÁRS AND SHÍRÁZ

> Iran has had a long, rich, and complex history—a history comprising
> many cycles of expansions, invasions, revivals, survivals, and reversals of
> fortune. From the very beginning, the history of Iran has been inexorably
> tied to the Province of Fárs. The Iranian-speaking Aryan tribes ﬁrst came
> to northern Fárs in the middle Paleolithic period; later the valleys of the
> Kur and Pulwar Rivers became their centers and remained so until the
time of the Sassanid Dynasty in the seventh century AD.

Cyrus the Great founded the Achaemenian Dynasty (559–330BC) in
> Fárs, and his son Darius the Great (reigned 522–486BC) built Persepolis
> where the Pulwar ﬂows into the Kur on the plain of Marv-Dasht. The
> nucleus of their Empire was called Persis and had its seat in the royal
> cities of Pasargadae and Persepolis. The kings of Achaemenian were wise
> and benevolent, ruling their empire for 229 years until Alexander the
> Macedonian founded the Seleucidian Dynasty (311BC), spreading all
> across Iran, where he founded many new towns in the Párs (Fárs) region.
> Párs was part of this dynasty until the period of Antioukhous IV. After
> the Parthians liberated the central parts of the Seleucidian Empire, Párs
became an independent state.

Another town on the banks of the Pulwar, called Istakhr in the Middle
> Ages, was the focal point of the Sassanian Dynasty (224–651, founded
> by Ardishir Babakan). Other cities of Fárs, such as Shíráz, Fasá, Siraf, and
> Arrajan, later outshone Istakhr in terms of size and signiﬁcance. Coins
> found in the region as early as 250BC have imprints of Pahlaví scripts
with Iranian ﬁgures and Zoroastrian braziers.

Muslim Arabs ﬁrst invaded Iran during the reign of ʿUmar, the second
> caliph. The people of Fárs displayed much bravery in face of the invading
> Arabs and in 638 defeated the Ibn Hazrami forces. In spite of Iranian
> resistance, ultimately towns in Fárs submitted to the Muslims and by
force were converted to Islam.

In the tenth century, at the time of the caliphate’s weakness, Fárs was
> overtaken by Yaʿqúb Laís, the founder of the Saﬀarian Dynasty, and
> Shíráz became their capital. Yaʿqúb’s brother constructed the city’s Jumʿih
> mosque. Subsequently, Fárs fell into the hands of the next set of rulers,
> Al-i Buyih and Siljukians. And with the demise of the latter, Ibn Mudúd

> established Atábakan Dynasty in the province and ruled until 1149 when
the Mongols invaded the entire region.

In 1353, the Al-i Muzafar Dynasty came to power in Fárs and ruled
> until 1490. With the founding of the Safavid Dynasty at the beginning
> of the sixteenth century, the entire country, including Fárs, was compelled
to adopt Shiʿi sect of Islam.

In short, throughout history, Fárs ﬂourished and waned according to
> the fortunes of the ruling party. Often Shíráz served as various monarchs’
> capital, but eventually power, money, and inﬂuence shifted to the north-
> erly cities of Tihrán and Isfahán. Fárs nevertheless remained a signiﬁcant
> commercial and cultural center. Today, its capital, Shíráz, is not only the
> bustling hub of commerce for the Fárs region but also one of the most
> industrialized cities in Iran. It is a major destination for tourists who
> appreciate historical sites and art centers and who wish to pay homage
at the tombs of the poets Saʿdí and Háﬁz.

Several nomadic ethnic groups, including the Qashqáʾís, Buyír-Ahmadís,
> Lurs, Khamsih, and Kuh-Kiluyih, continue to inhabit Fárs. Nomads typi-
> cally spend summers on the high plateaus and move south to the Persian
> Gulf in winter to search for pastures for their herds; others spend winters
> in a city. These groups represent not only an economic mode of produc-
> tion but also a lifestyle that has strong cultural and traditional roots in
many parts of Iran.551

At the present, Fárs remains one of the largest Iranian provinces, with an
> area of 133,294 square kilometers. In 1998, this province had a population
> of 4.2 million people of whom 42% resided in rural areas and the rest
> were urban settlers. It is a region with great historical signiﬁcance.

Geography and Climate of Fárs

> The Zagros mountain chain crosses the province from the northwest
> towards the southeast, dividing the province into two distinct parts.
> The ﬁrst is located in the north-northwest, while the second is located
> in the south-southeast area of the province, and both are mountainous
> highlands. The north part starts from Semirum elevations and ends south
> of Ábádih, at the point called Kuh ʿAzimat, and its arduous pass. The
> southern part consists of the highlands of the Shíráz area, including the

> Maharlu, Kharman, and Tudaj Mountains. The western section is the
> prolongation of Kuh-Kiluyih highlands towards the Mamasaní Mountains,
> and the southern region includes the Dáráb Mountains and the Tangistan
Highland.

There are three distinct climatic regions in Fárs. First, the mountainous
> area of the north and northwest with moderate cold winters and mild sum-
> mers. Second, the central regions, with relatively rainy mild winters and
> hot dry summers. The third region is located in the south and southeast.
> Due to lower altitude and mountain position, the quantity of rainfall in
> winter is lower than in spring and autumn. It has moderate winters with
> very hot summers.

Shíráz

> There was probably a sizable settlement on the site of Shíráz in prehis-
> toric times, and cuneiform records from the great ceremonial capital of
> Persepolis show that Shíráz was a signiﬁcant township in Achaemenian
> times. According to the ancient Elamite clay tablets found in Persepolis,
> the name for this city was written Tirazis. Phonetically, this is interpreted
> as tiracis or ćiracis. This name became Old Persian sirájis; through sound
> change comes the modern Persian name Shíráz.552 Under the Sassanians,
it became one of the main cities of the Province of Fárs.553

However, the city only became the provincial capital in 693, after the
> Arab armies conquered Istakhr, the nearby Sassanian capital.554 As Istakhr
> fell into decline, Shíráz grew in importance under the Arabs and several
> local dynasties. The Buyids (945–1055) made it their capital, building
> mosques, palaces, a famous library, and a great city wall. The invading
> Mongols spared the city when its local ruler oﬀered tributes and submis-
> sion to Genghis Khan, and the city reached new heights of prosperity
> under the Mongols (1220–1380). Shíráz was again spared by Timberline
> when in 1382 the local monarch, Shah Shujaʿ, agreed to submit to the
> invader, even oﬀering the hand of his granddaughter to a grandson of
> Timberline.

The name Shíráz also appears on clay seals found at Qasr-i Abu Nasr, a Sassanid
ruin, east of the city.

The city is referred to in Hudúduʾl-ʿalam al-Mashriq ila al-Maghrib, p. 126, where
> two ﬁre temples and a fortress called Shammubad are reported. Hamduʾlláh Mustawﬁ also
veriﬁes the existence of pre-Islamic settlements in Shíráz in Nushatuʾl-Qulub, p. 112.

Shíráz fell into Arab hands in 641, and Istakhr fell in 653.

RABBANI_F3-221-380.indd 363                                                                               7/10/2008 2:44:33 PM

After Shah Shujaʿ’s death, there was a turbulent succession of rulers for
> several years, until Timberline appointed his son as ruler of the city. In the
> thirteenth century, Shíráz became a leading center of the arts and letters
> due to the encouragement of its enlightened ruler and the presence of
> many scholars and artists. For this reason the city was named by classical
> geographers the Daruʾl-ʿIlm [the realm of knowledge]. Many of the most
> important Iranian poets, mystics, and philosophers were born in Shíráz
> and contributed to the fame of the city. Among them are numbered the
> poets Saʿdí and Háﬁz, the mystic Rúzbihán, and the philosopher Mullá
Sadrá.

Throughout the Safavid Empire (1502–1722) Shíráz remained a pro-
> vincial capital, and Imám Qulí Khán, the governor of Fárs under Shah
> ʿAbbás I, constructed many palaces and ornate buildings in the same style
> of those built in the same period in Isfahán, the capital of the empire.555
> During this period, the city attracted a number of European traders who
> exported its famous wine. After the fall of the Safavid, Shíráz suﬀered a
> period of decline worsened by several earthquakes in the region, the raids
> of the Afghans, and the rebellion of its governor against Nadir Shah. The
> latter sent troops to subdue the revolt, and the city was besieged for many
> months and eventually sacked. At the time of Nadir Shah’s assassination in
> 1747, most of the historic buildings of the city were damaged or ruined,
> and its population dropped to 50,000, a quarter of what it was in the
sixteenth century.

Shíráz soon returned to prosperity under the enlightened rule of Karím
> Khán Zand, who made it the capital during his reign in 1762. Although
> master of virtually all of Iran, Karím Khán refused to take the title of
> king and contented himself with that of Vakíl [regent]. Karím Khán was
> a wise ruler and one of the greatest patrons of the arts in Iranian history.
> Employing more than 12,000 workers, he constructed a royal district with
> a fortress, many administrative buildings, a mosque, and one of the ﬁnest
> covered bazaars in Iran. He had a moat built around the city, constructed
a clever irrigation and drainage system, and rebuilt the city walls.

However Karím Khán’s heirs failed to secure his gains, and when Ághá
> Muhammad Khán, the founder of the Qájár Dynasty, eventually came
> to power, he wreaked his revenge on Shíráz by destroying the city for-
> tiﬁcation and moving the national capital to Tihrán in 1789. Although

In 1630, a ﬂood destroyed a large segment of the city, which was later mostly rebuilt.
Another ﬂood hit the city in 1668.

> lowered to the rank of provincial capital, Shíráz maintained a level of
> prosperity as a result of the continuing importance of the trade route to

> residences built during the nineteenth century contribute to the current
look of the city.556

During the Pahlaví era, large capital projects were funded for Shíráz to
> revive the grandeur of Achaemenid Persia. The 2500th anniversary of the
> Persian Empire and the large ﬂow of investment in Pahlaví University were
> notable projects among others drawn up for this purpose, giving Shíráz
a prominent status among Iranian cities by the late 1970s.

More recently, a number of restoration and reconstruction projects
> have taken place in Shíráz. Among these projects are the restoration of
> the Karím Khán Fortress and Vakíl Bath; plans for the preservation of
> the Old City quarter; renovation of the Qurʾán Gate and the mausoleum
> of the poet Khajú Kirmaní, both located in the Alláh-Akbar canyon; and
> the expansion of the Háﬁz mausoleum. The Iram and Qavám aromatic
> ﬂower gardens are popular points of attraction. The population of the

> In addition to Shíráz, the other important towns in Fárs that are referred
> to in the present volume include: Ábádih, Ardakán, Bávanát, Dáráb,
> Istahbánát, Fasá, Fíruz-Ábád, Jahrum, Kázirún, Lár, Mamasaní, Marv-
> Dasht, and Nayríz. They are brieﬂy described below.

> Ábádih
> Located about 640 km. south of Tihrán, this city dates back to antiquity.
> However, the town was developed in earnest after Karím Khán Zand chose
> Shíráz as the nation’s capital. Ábádih is the mountainous, northernmost
> city of Fárs and is located at an altitude of 2,000 m. in a vast plain known
> as Sarhad. It has fertile lands that attract tribes such as the Qashqáʾí in
> summer and spring. Various religious and historical monuments have
> remained from past ages.

Shíráz suﬀered two major earthquakes in 1824 and 1853, resulting in considerable
damage though a number of historic buildings were spared.

> Ardakán
> Also known as Sipídan, Ardakán is located in the northern region of Fárs,
> in a mountainous and forested region mostly covered with oak trees. The
> City of Ardakán is about eight centuries old.

> Bávanát
> In the past this town was a part of Ábádih and more recently was named
> its own township with Surian as its center. The history of Bávanát is
> intertwined with Ábádih’s.

> Dáráb
> Originally known as Dárábgard, Dáráb is located to the southeast in the
> province. Dáráb is geographically divided into two regions: the northeast
> region is mountainous and ﬁlled with forests, while the south-central
> region is at a much lower altitude and includes vast plains. It is in the
> latter region where the ancient city was raised, and its historical build-
> ings remain to this day, including Dihya Castle. Dáráb is known for its
> many orchards.

> Istahbánát
> Situated 1,112 km. from Tihrán, this city suﬀered terribly during the
> Mongol invasion. Rebuilt by Amír Mubaruzʾd-Dín of Al-i Muzafar in
> 1346, Istahbánát is located at two diﬀerent altitudes and to the south of
> Bakhtigan Lake. The eastern part of the town has a warm climate, and
> the rest is mild due to the inﬂuence of mountains. Orchards of ﬁg trees
> have contributed to the economy of this region.

> Fasá
> Located in a mountainous region to the southeast of Shíráz, Fasá includes
> a number of villages surrounding the town. Only the southeast and
> northwest regions of Fasá are to some extent ﬂat. In the clay inscriptions
> at Persepolis, the town’s name was mentioned as “Peshi Ya” or “Beshi
> Ya.” The town was conquered by Muslim armies in 644, and in the tenth
> century enjoyed the status of being the second most important town of
> Dárábgard State, equaling the status of Shíráz.

> Fíruz-Ábád
> Located 1,035 km. from Tihrán in a mountainous region with a moderate
> climate in north and warm weather in the south, Fíruz-Ábád is one of
> the primary gathering points for the Qashqáʾí tribes. The present Fíruz-
> Ábád is located a few miles southeast of a historical monument known
> as Gúr commissioned by Ardishír Bábakán, the founder of the Sassanian
> Dynasty. Arabs captured this city in 649 and converted the people to
> Islam. A number of important historical monuments, principally from
> the Sassanian Period and comparable to those found at Persepolis, are
> still evident in this region.

> Jahrum
> Located southeast of Shíráz and 1,158 km. from Tihrán, this city is one
> of the oldest in Iran and has a number of historical sites. It has a warm
> climate with famous palm groves and citrus orchards.

> Kázirún
> Located to the west of Shíráz and 1,032 km. from Tihrán, this town has
> a warm climate and is one of the oldest cities of Iran, ﬁrst developed in
> 483–495 by Fíruz, the son of Bahrám of the Sassanian Empire. A few
> years later it was further developed and enlarged by Qubád. The Parishan
> Protected Lake is situated to the southeast of Kázirún. In former times,
> the City of Shápúr was more populous than Kázirún, and its ruins remain
> in the vicinity. Many historical monuments in this city remain.

> Lár
> Situated 1,324 km. from Tihrán, this town is located in a ﬂat area with
> a very warm climate. In the Sassanian Period, due to the construction of
> a ﬁre temple, this region became the center of attention. By the end of
> the eighth century, it was the center for minting a coin known as Larbun,
> used in the coastal regions of the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean.

> Mamasaní
> Located to the west of Shíráz, Mamasaní has a cold climate in the north
> and a warm climate in the south. In ancient history books, Mamasaní was
> mentioned as Shulistan—a derivative of Shul, one of the Lur tribes.

> Marv-Dasht
> This town is located to north of Shíráz and has a cold climate in the hilly
> areas and a moderate climate in its other regions. Archeological excavations
> have shown that millennia before Darius decided to choose the plains of
> Mount Rahmat for the construction of the majestic Persepolis Palaces,
> people lived in Marv-Dasht Plains. The ruins of Istakhr and Persepolis
> illustrate portions of the city’s ancient history.

> Nayríz
> Located about 1,140 km. from Tihrán, Nayríz is situated southeast of
> Bakhtigan Lake. This city has a moderate climate in the north and is
> warm in the south. In the clay inscriptions of Persepolis, it is mentioned
> as Narizi. Ancient Arsiman in Natanz is 6,000 years old.

Persian Languages

> An evolved version of the ancient Persian tongue—known as Fársí or Pársí,
> both derived from the Hellenized form Persis of the root word Párs—is
> widely spoken today in Iran, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan. This lan-
> guage belongs to the Iranian branch of the Indo-Iranian language family
> and has had a rich heritage and continues to evolve.

> Old Persian
> Old Persian was contemporaneous with Avestan, another Old Iranian
> language. Old Persian is preserved through cuneiform tablets found in the
> remains after the Achaemenid Dynasty. The oldest traces of Old Persian
> date to the sixth century BC, but it was spoken until the third century
> BC. Old Persian was spoken in southwestern Iran, while Avestan was
> spoken in northeastern Iran. In addition to the two languages, there must
> have been at least a third. Median is mentioned by the Greek historian
> Herodotus. It is believed that there must have been a fair level of mutual
> intelligibility among the Iranian languages of this period, and more than
> there would be in later periods.

> Middle Persian
> Middle Persian was contemporaneous with Parthian, and during the
> Arsacid Period, Persian was strongly inﬂuenced by Parthian. Middle

> Persian was the language used in the Sassanian Empire and was called
> Pahlaví. Middle Persian was, like Old Persian, spoken in southwestern
> Iran; Parthian was spoken in the north, while a group of languages
> (Khwarezmian, Sogdian, and Saka) were spoken in southeast. The gram-
> mar of Middle Persian was simpler than Old Persian’s. The script used
> was an ambiguous script with multivalent letters, derived from Aramaic.
> Middle Persian would last until the ninth century, although its decline
> began with the introduction of Arabic two centuries earlier.

> Modern Persian
> Modern Persian, known as Fársí, the language of Iran today, was devel-
> oped as early as the ninth century. It was in many ways a continuation of
> Middle Persian, but there were important inﬂuences coming from other
> Iranian languages. Modern Persian used an expanded form of Arabic
> writing, introducing letters like ch, p, zh, g, and changing the pronuncia-
> tion of Arabic zh into za. There is also a large inclusion of Arabic words
> in Modern Persian, by some estimates exceeding 40%. The grammar of
> Modern Persian is simpler than Middle Persian’s (just as Middle Persian
> was simpler than Old Persian). Most of the inﬂectional systems are lost,
> and there is no system of case inﬂection. Possession is shown by a suﬃx
> called izaﬁh. Tense, mood, voice, and negative are likewise indicated by a
> series of preﬁxes and inﬁxes (word elements inserted inside a word).

SURIH HAJJ FOR THE HOUSE OF THE BÁB IN SHIRAZ

> O Muhammad, when the fragrances of holiness have drawn thee unto

> Thy Lord, the Generous, unto the spot around which circle the angels

> desire and from thy feet the sandals of sin and wickedness, for thou art

> all that are on earth and in the heavens, wherein naught but the greatest

a thousand years as you number them.

And when thou hast journeyed from thy self and from the world and

where thou art and say:

> Spirit and light and glory and praise be upon thee, O City of God, O dwell-

> Him with such devotion that thereby the tongues of all atoms may utter
> the praise of thy Creator and may make mention of Him that brought
> thee into existence, the Powerful, the Mighty, the Wondrous. And if thou

> stood the bodies of the holy ones and them that are nigh unto God. Nor
> art thou worthy of thy relation unto my Self nor thy habitation beneath
> the shadow of my love, which God hath made a cutting sword whereby
> to separate the unbelievers from them that extol His oneness. And when
> thou hast raised thy hands unto the clouds of the mercy of thy Lord, the
Mighty, the Knowing, the All-Informed, say:

> I bear witness that no god is there but He; He is alone, no companion is
> there for Him nor likeness nor deputy nor comparison nor rival nor equal
> nor similitude for His sovereignty, the Exalted, the Inaccessible, the Most
> High. From all eternity He was one in His Essence and one in His attri-

> ever been in the glory of His majesty and the sovereignty of His sublimity,
> such that the mystic knowers have confessed their inability to attain unto
> the meadows of the holiness of His knowledge and the devoted ones have
> admitted their powerlessness to ascend unto the heaven of His mention and
> His praise. He, verily, is the Protector of all things and He, in truth, is the
> Mighty, the AllGenerous. I bear witness that the Primal Point [the Báb] our

> through Him every poor and needy one ascended unto the heaven of riches
> and every transient one rose up unto the dwelling-places of eternal life and

wherein the clouds of Thy grace rained down upon all created things.

thee of the call that is mighty by the side of the Throne.

Whosoever visiteth the House as We have commanded him, God shall
> raise him up after his death within the paradise of majesty and grandeur in
> such a beauteous form that the dwellers of the Concourse on High shall be
> illumined by the lights of his face, and all that are in the exalted heavens
> shall be commanded to appear before him and to circle about him and
> to make their pilgrimage unto his beauty every morning and evening. O
> trustees of God upon the earth, strive unto the most great mention, and
> cast away all that is in your hands and turn your faces unto the Abode
> of God, the Mighty, the Powerful, the All-Knowing. Be ye steadfast, O
> people, in this station that, if all that are on earth should rise up against
> you, ye would not pay the least attention to them and would remain ﬁrm
> in the faith of God. The unbelievers shall prevent you performing what
> God has sent down upon you on account of the rancour that is in their
