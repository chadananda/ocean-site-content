ABDU'L-BAHÁ, WASHINGTON, D.C., 1912  
_Frontispiece_  
  

_Portals To Freedom_ was first published before many of the current translations of Bahá'í writings were available. Some of the quotations used in this book were taken from earlier renditions of these works, as for example, _The Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys_, _The Hidden Words_ and others. Also several quotations were taken from a compilation, _Bahá'í Scriptures_, much of which has been retranslated and revised into a newer work called _Bahá'í World Faith_. For an accurate rendition of the Bahá'í Writings, these current editions should be used as references.
