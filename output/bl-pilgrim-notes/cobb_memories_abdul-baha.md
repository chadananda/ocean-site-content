Memories of `Abdu'l-Bahá

By Stanwood Cobb
I first met 'Abdu'1-Baha vicariously, so to speak,
and it was this meeting that brought me into the
Baha'i Faith in the summer of 1906. It happened that
being in the vicinity of Green Acre that summer I
made a pilgrimage there to see what it was all about.
My curiosity had been aroused by weekly articles in
the Boston Transcript. At this time I was studying
for the Unitarian ministry at the Harvard Divinity
School.

It was a warm Sunday afternoon in August. The big
tent on Green Acre's lower level, where the lecture
hall now is located, was filled to capacity to hear
some famous sculptor from New York. I was not great-
ly interested in his lecture. It was not for the sake of
art that I had come, but for the sake of religion.

At the end of the lecture I went up to speak to
Sarah Farmer—who had been presiding in her own
ineffable way, shedding a warm spiritual glow upon
the whole affair. As I had previously met her in Cam-
bridge at the home of Mrs. Ole Bull, I ventured to
recall myself to her.

Miss Farmer took my hand in hers and cordially
held it while she looked into my eyes and asked,
"Have you heard of the Persian Revelation?"

> "No," I answered.
"Well, go to that lady in a white headdress and
