Translator’s Foreword

God gave us memories
that we might have June roses
in the December of our lives.

—James Barrie, a Scottish poet

Mírzá Habíbu’lláh was born into a Bahá’í family of Jewish
heritage on 19 January 1888 in Kirmánsháh, Iran, and the surname
“Mú’ayyad,” meaning “confirmed,” was later bestowed upon him by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He received his elementary education in the city of his
birth and continued his secondary education in a school founded by
American Presbyterian missionaries in Hamadán.1 His father,
Khudábakhsh, was a devoted Bahá’í who, when his eldest son Mírzá
Múrád was martyred because of his affiliation to the Bahá’í Faith,
went to the authorities and interceded on behalf of his son’s
murderer.

In October 1907, the young Habíb traveled to the Holy Land,
where he spent a month receiving wisdom from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
Although the plan had been for him to proceed to the United States
to further his education, at the suggestion of an eminent Bahá’í,
Mírzá Hakím Hárún, and with the approval of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Habíb
instead directed his steps to Beirut. There he enrolled as a student at
the Syrian Protestant College2. During this period he had the bounty
of frequent association with Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl of Gulpáygán and
during regular visits to the Holy Land he sought spiritual knowledge
from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and such outstanding Bahá’í scholars as Mírzá
Haydar-‘Alí of Isfahán.

A portion of this period of tutelage in Beirut overlapped with

1 In Iran most of the missionaries were either American Presbyterians or from the
Church Missionary Society in England. The former established schools as well as
hospitals throughout Iran.

that of Shoghi Effendi Rabbani, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s grandson and future
Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith. In Beirut, Habíb Mú’ayyad eagerly
engaged in serving his fellow Bahá’ís, corresponding with various
communities, extending hospitality to visitors and pilgrims, and
receiving and dispatching ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablets to their ultimate
destinations.

Habíb completed his medical studies at the Protestant College
of Beirut in the Spring of 1914. In July of that year he and a
schoolmate, ‘Azízu’lláh Bahádur, were requested by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to
visit Germany to counter the activities of Dr. Amínu’lláh Faríd, who
had withdrawn from the Bahá’í Faith and was traveling in Europe in
defiance of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s requests.

After completing this mission, Dr. Mú’ayyad returned to the
Holy Land. World War I had begun. From November 1914 to May
1915 he operated a medical dispensary that was open to all in the
Druze village of Abu Sinan [Abú-Sínán], northeast of ‘Akká, where
‘Abdu’l-Bahá had settled the Bahá’ís temporarily. The modest room
set aside for Dr. Mú’ayyad’s clinic also served as a school room for
the classes taught by Mírzá Badí‘ Bushrú’í. Although the world
during this period was greatly convulsed and troubles assailed the
small colony of Bahá’ís on every side, Dr. Mú’ayyad was often heard
to say in later years that this time spent near ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the
Holy Family was among the sweetest and most memorable periods
of his life.

Dr. Mú’ayyad later returned to Haifa upon the instruction of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá and, some weeks later, was instructed to proceed to
Iran. His final days with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the Holy Land were blessed
with daily lessons in devotion to the Bahá’í Faith, which doubtless
served to fill his heart and soul with illumination and guidance,
directing his future endeavors in the Bahá’í Faith. On the occasion
of Dr. Mú’ayyad’s departure for Iran, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá addressed a
letter to Dr. Mú’ayyad’s father stating that he should thank God for
such a “worthy son” and describing Habíb as a “lamp enkindled
with the love of God” and as one “engaged in the service of
humanity.” The father should, in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s words, “infinitely

Habíb Mu’ayyad / Ahang Rabbani 3

rejoice in beholding his countenance and in inhaling the fragrances
of his presence.”

Upon returning to his native land in spring of 1915, Dr.

Mú’ayyad settled in Kirmánsháh, where he married Zínát Dádvar
from a prominent Muslim family with considerable influence in
government and in the religious life of the region.3 They had seven
children, whom they named ‘Inayat, Manuchir, Bahieh, Lili,
Iskandar, Hushang, and Gity.

Pursuant of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s counsel, Dr. Mú’ayyad forged
personal ties with local government officials and with people of
every class and creed. While fully occupied with his medical practice,
he nevertheless found time, as circumstances permitted, to impart
the Bahá’í teachings to those whom he found to be responsive. He
always stood resolutely firm in the face of difficulties, a shield
protecting the Bahá’ís against periodic assaults by enemies of the
religion. He was a member of the Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís
of Kirmánsháh for some twenty-five years and also served on the
Spiritual Assemblies of Tihran, Qulhak, and Darús for a long period.
In April 1945 he was elected to the National Spiritual Assembly of
the Bahá’ís of Iran, on which body he served for a number of years
with devotion and distinction.

Many times during the course of his professional career, Dr.

Mú’ayyad was offered prominent positions in the Iranian
government, including the directorship of various Ministries. He was
also urged to become a member of the National Parliament, but he
consistently refused these political posts and devoted himself to the
practice of medicine, as this had been ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s wish. For two
years he headed the Bahá’í-owned Mithaqiyh Hospital, but he soon
returned to private practice, as he always preferred ministering
directly to his patients.

When informed of Dr. Habíb Mú’ayyad’s death, the Universal

Wuthúqu’s-Saltanih Dádvar, the war minister during the Constitutional Revolution
and a close alley of Reza Shah Pahlaví. Zínát’s mother, the Navábu’s-Saltanih,
descended from the royal family of Fath-‘Alí Shah Qájár.

Dr. Mú’ayyad’s Diary
In his chronicle, Dr. Mú’ayyad writes that it was during his sojourn
in Germany that he learned how the Europeans kept diary records.
On his return to the Holy Land, he adopted this practice and kept
very close notes of his daily observations, particularly ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
utterances from September 1914 to May 1915. It has been noted
that he dearly treasured these precious notebooks during his years in
Iran.4

unaware of the whereabouts of these notebooks. It is likely that they are at the

On 11 June 1952, the National Spiritual Assembly of the
Bahá’ís of Iran, on which body Dr. Mú’ayyad was serving at the
time, wrote him the following letter:

[Signed] Secretary of the National Spiritual
Assembly, ‘Alí-Akbar Furútan.

In accordance with the above request, Dr. Mú’ayyad quickly
prepared a copy of his diary, which he supplemented with some
other reminiscences of his years in the Holy Land, entitling the
resulting memoir, Khátirát Habíb áz Bayánát Mahbúb7 [Habíb’s
Recollections of the Beloved’s Utterances]. This manuscript was
sent to the Holy Land in the same year. A few years later, in 1961, it
was published by the Bahá’í Publishing Trust of Iran, along with
several previously published articles by the diarist. This volume was
reprinted by the Bahá’í-Verlag of Germany in 1998, with an index.
Though it contains a number of typographical errors and suffers
from other deficiencies, it is this version that is used as the basis for
the present translation.

In 1972, Dr. Mú’ayyad published a second volume of his
memories, this being principally devoted to the notes he kept from

his mission to Germany in the summer of 1914. The present
translation of Dr. Mú’ayyad’s memoirs is a selection from the first
volume.

The following notations have been adopted throughout the
translation:

> ( ) parenthetical comments inserted by the diarist
> [ ] bracketed clarifying phrases supplied by the translator
> < > page numbers of the 1998 edition of the Persian text are
indicated every five pages.

Footnotes contributed by the author are identified by the
initials (HM). Other footnotes are by the translator.

As Dr. Mú’ayyad has noted in several places in the text, the
remarks attributed to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in this diary represent the
author’s recollections after his return to the pilgrim house and often
provide merely an outline of the many themes addressed by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. Therefore, while these notes are most illuminating, it should
be understood that they carry no scriptural authority. The obvious
exceptions are the various Tablets quoted in the narrative, the
substance of which is translated in the present volume by the
undersigned. Unless an authoritative source (published by the Bahá'í
World Centre) is cited, these renderings pertain to the class of
“provisional translations.”

Occasionally, Dr. Mú’ayyad quotes words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá or
certain events in Arabic. It is not clear to the present translator
whether the diarist originally noted them in Arabic or if they are
excerpts from other diary records, such as those kept by Dr. Zia
Baghdadi, and were included by Dr. Mú’ayyad for the sake of
completeness.

Various pictures have been added by the translator.

In 1997, after consultation with members of the Universal House of

Justice about suitability of translating Dr. Mú’ayyad’s Diary and
identifying an appropriate translator, I was honored to be
approached by the family of Dr. Mú’ayyad to undertake this project.
In the process of rendering this translation, I have been greatly
encouraged by Dr. Mú’ayyad’s children, Mrs. Bahieh Moayyad-
Khademi and Drs. Iskandar and Houshang Moayyad. I wish to
hereby record my heartfelt gratitude to them for the bestowal of this
great honor and trust. Dr. Mú’ayyad’s granddaughter, Mona
Khademi, was helpful as my contact point with the family and ably
facilitated a number of important interactions.

Note: While the original manuscript of this book was completed in
February 1999, its publication was obstructed due to factors beyond
my control. During this interval, I had the opportunity to reconsider
parts of translation and to add further research notes. The project
also greatly benefited from discussions on Tarikh Internet
Discussion group when portions of the monograph were posted in
installments in 2004. Subsequently, with great care and attention, my
learned friend Phillip Tussing read the manuscript and offered a
number of suggestions towards its improvement. All errors and
shortcomings, however, are mine.

Author’s Foreword

In the name of God,
the Glorious, the Most Resplendent!

In this monograph I will record selections from my diary that
pertain to the period of my education at the American University of
Beirut and the precious days I spent on the sanctified ground of
‘Akká and Haifa. Moreover, I will share certain notes from the
utterances I heard spoken by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá—may my spirit be a
sacrifice unto His steadfast Friends.8

Preamble and Exhortations
Unrestrained praise and salutation be upon that much-loved Creator
Who has brought forth humankind from absolute nothingness and
bestowed the robe of existence. God has provided humankind all
manner of sustenance, and arrayed the entire creation and creatures
to serve him, and to aid, educate, and edify him. He has assigned
man specific duties and service unto others. Moreover, He has
granted him a period of life consisting of a mix of sorrows and joys,
sullied by desires and egos, combined with ease and discomfort, and
joined by profit and loss – all of these coming to an end in an
instant, much as a scroll is rolled up or a spider’s web is smashed:
“And these are of Thy everlasting decrees beneath the Tree of Thy
Appearance, O my Lord.” For Him the hidden and primary mystery
[of creation] is evident and the ultimate purpose is achieved.

These struggles, fights for survival, tussles to earn daily bread,
and all the other efforts that man exerts unconsciously – much like
different parts of a mindless machine – these are necessary [for our
spiritual growth]. Parts of man’s character are his egotism,
selfishness, self-centeredness, pride and arrogance, which are all
8   “The Friends” was and continues to be a term used to refer to Bahá’ís.

signs of his ignorance and negligence. That is, had man understood
the divine purpose, comprehended the goal and objective of
creation, and was he not subject to various desires and lusts, and had
he humbled himself before the sacred laws and traditions, he would
never subjugate himself to these childish proclivities and behaviors.
He would instead consider himself part of a greater whole and
unworthy of such immature inclinations.

If man understood how completely bounded and ephemeral
he was, he would never allow himself the temerity to leave behind a
mark or a sign. If he thoroughly comprehended how passing and
unfaithful this world is, he would never be attached to this abode of
dust or this life filled with agonies. Instead, untroubled, he would
take refuge in fields and meadows, renouncing this world and
everything therein.

But since manifold mysteries are concealed in every part of
creation, therefore, this neglect and ignorance of man must also
enshrine great wisdom. That is, there are great mysteries and
wisdom behind this ignorance and disregard of man. And had it not
been such, the world be engulfed in disorder, societal structure
would be disrupted, and thorough confusion would result at every
level of the functioning of this world.

The utterance “Every name hath been created by His Word”9 is an
evident truth and no question, doubt or hesitation is permitted unto
it. Therefore, one must observe instant obedience and unreserved
submission.

One must be of benefit to society and at every hour be ready
to submit to the call of the Divine Creator. We must gather goodly
spiritual fruits for presentation to our Lord when we leave this plane
of existence. And upon you be peace!

Introduction
By the grace of God, this ephemeral servant, Habíbu’lláh (Dr. Habíb

9   Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb Aqdas, K167.

Mú’ayyad), son of Khudábakhsh Kirmánsháhí, was elected to the
National Spiritual Assembly of Iran in the spring of 1324 Sh [April
1945]. Since I was not otherwise occupied with work during the
morning hours, as an exhortation for [the edification of] my
descendants, I set myself to briefly writing my memoirs, describing
what I had observed and what had occurred, the difficulties and
tribulations that I had sustained in life, and to capture a general
record of my recollections, (as the past is a mirror for the future and
a guide for posterity). Inasmuch as what ultimately counts in life is
its quality rather than its quantity, and that life must serve a purpose
and bear fruit – regardless of the length of life in this transient world
– therefore the only times I found worth recording were those I
spent in the Holy Land in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and
associating with the friends, pilgrims and residents of that sacred
realm.

These events have penetrated my soul and being, have been
ever-inscribed on my consciousness and will be recorded in these
pages. The remainder of the events of my life will be written in a
separate book and will be removed from this notebook.

Happy was the hour spent with friends;

the rest was pointless and expended fruitlessly.

It should not remain concealed that I have several notebooks
of memoirs and that I had wished to publish them all. However, my
intention was that prior to their publication and becoming available
to the general public, they first receive the approved of the beloved
Guardian of the Cause, so that I would not egotistically disseminate
records that might be incompatible with the interests of the blessed
Cause and have them fall into the hands of nonbelievers.

As such, I will not reproduce the remainder of these diaries in
this volume, but leave them instead for some future opportunity,
and here limit myself exclusively to giving an account of [‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s] blessed utterances. I will also describe the circumstances
associated with His heavenly words, so that matters are presented
clearly for the reader.

Chapter 1

Journey to Beirut for Education

[Departure from Iran]
Together with the honored Mírzá Isháq Khán Haqíqí and his wife,
Firdaws Khánum, we left for the Holy Land in October 1907 by way
of Qum, Tihrán, Qazvín, Rasht, Anzalí, Bákú, Batum and Istanbul.
In Tihrán, we stayed with the honored Hand of the Cause Hájí
Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar, known as Hájí Akhúnd. We had met him in Qum,
where he and some other [Bahá’ís] had come to pay homage at the
burial place of the honored Manuchihr Khán10 Gurjí.11

In Qazvín we were the guests of the most hospitable and
gracious Mírzá Músá Khán Hakím-Báshí [physician]. At that time
the entire transportation system of the region was under the control
of Siyyid Nasru’lláh Báqiroff, and he had instructed his men to
provide for our comfort and ease. All the inns on our route
belonged to him, and every two hours we reached a new rest station
where our carriage horses were changed and where we refreshed
ourselves. Each location was informed of our arrival in advance and
refreshments readied, and this allowed us to journey day and night
with great ease, never feeling fatigue along the way. Filled with joy
and elation, we constantly gave thanks for the divine grace that was
so abundantly showered upon us. With feelings of ecstasy and
rapture we pondered how, through God’s bounty, strangers were
turned into age-old friends, how the means for the universal unity of
men were provided and how spiritual brothers and sisters

10The Mu‘tamidu’d-Dawlih. (HM)
11For the story of the Báb’s stay in Isfahán with Manuchihr Khán see Nabil
Zarandí, The Dawn-Breakers, chapter 10. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has revealed a Visitation
Tablet (see, ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Ishráq-Khávarí, Risálih Ayyám Tis‘ih, p. 195) for
Manuchihr Khán and has noted that visiting his resting-place is exceedingly
meritorious. As such, when possible, Bahá’ís often visit his resting-place.

surrounded all His servants. How wondrous indeed was the field of
love and how vast the realm of fellowship spread before us! Exalted
be His Grandeur and exalted be His Sovereignty! “Exalted art Thou
to shine forth Thy eminent Effulgence over all created things!”
“Exalted art Thou Who hast revived the dead earth by Thy Love!”
“Exalted art Thou Who didst cause the water of unity to flow from
Thine Overflowing Stream!” “Exalted art Thou Who hast called into
being a new creation!” “Exalted be the Founder of this glorious
Age!”

In Bádkúbih we were able to visit the divine friends. The
honored Hájí Qalandar [served] in the [Bahá’í] guesthouse. Áqá
Músá Naqíoff would frequently come in his personal and luxurious
carriage. We learned from others that he was a man of great wealth
and immense affluence, and was overheard to remark that, single
and alone, he intended to use his fortune to raise a Mashriqu’l-
Adhkár in Bádkúbih, similar to the one constructed in ‘Ishqábád.
However, he procrastinated so long that he failed to make good use
of his wealth and eventually spent the last part of his life in abject
poverty and regret. Bahá’u’lláh has revealed:

No doubt hath there ever been or remaineth that whatever
> ordinances or exhortations have been revealed by the Supreme Pen
> are for the betterment of Our servants. Consider, for instance, that
> the law of Huqúqu’lláh was revealed. Were the people <5> to
> adhere to it, surely God would surround them with His bounties,
> and bestow their sanctified possessions upon themselves and their
> descendants. However, do thou observe that most of the people do
> not benefit from their possessions, for God allows unbelievers to
> take hold of them, or for them to be inherited by unbelievers in
> preference to their descendants.12

In short, Naqíoff did not survive to fulfill his desire. Several
times, he was kidnapped by the riffraff who robbed him of his entire

attributed to Bahá’u’lláh.

estate. On these occasions, he was made to suffer various tortures.
For instance, [we later heard] he was hung by his arms over intense
fires, which compelled him to pay a ransom. His pitiful friends were
also forced to wear outworn clothing and sweep like janitors, until
eventually they all dispersed with no trace to be found.13 “Take notice,
O ye possessors of discernment!”14 Therefore, [as the poet states:]

Possessions can’t be taken to the next world,

give to charity before going.

In Istanbul, we confronted manifold difficulties. The principal
reason was that since the Iranian government had adopted
constitutional rule, fearing that such [liberal political] philosophy
would spill over to the Ottoman realm, the authorities, at the behest
of the monarch, Sultan ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd II, barred entrance to all
Iranian [subjects at ports of the Eastern Mediterranean].

13 For a Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in this regard, see Ishráq-Khavarí, Má’idih Ásimání,
vol. 9, p. 44; and for more biographical details on Naqioff, see, Ishráq-Khavarí,
Yádgar, pp. 22-23, and Fádil Mázandarání, Táríkh Zuhúru’l-Haqq, vol. 8, part 2, p.
1057\. In these two accounts, it is explained that Naqioff was in extreme poverty and
decided to rent some land from the Russian government and prospect for oil. His
initial diggings produced nothing and he wrote to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asking what he
should do. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá encouraged him to persevere and he eventually found oil in
such quantities that he went from poverty to being extremely rich in a short space of
time. When Hájí Amín came to Baku to collect the Huqúqu’lláh, however, Naqioff
wept profusely but handed over no money. (He appears to have been something of
a miser in that it is said that even after becoming wealthy he dressed worse than a
beggar did.)

When Hájí Amín reached the Holy Land, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked about Naqioff.

When Hájí Amín told him that, despite the fact that he was sitting on so much
money that he has to put it into storage, he had made no Huqúqu’lláh contribution,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá reportedly said, “Músá is of us but his wealth is not. If Hájí Músá gives
us money now, in the future it will be said that the religion of the Ancient Beauty
advance through the money of Hájí Músá … Bahá’u’lláh wants nothing to do with
such wealth.”

Hájí Músá died and his wealth went to people whom, during his life he had
so disliked that he would not let them into his house.
Our ship carried about two thousand pilgrims [on their way to
Jeddah and Mecca] who had business and other financial dealings in
Istanbul, which required meeting with the Iranian merchants in that
city. However, when we arrived [at the harbor], our vessel was
immediately surrounded by police who disallowed any
disembarkation. Regardless of our repeated appeals, “By God, we
are not pilgrims!”, the Turks nevertheless responded, “You must
proceed at once to Jeddah, the port of Mecca!” Through my limited
knowledge of geography, I was able to convince Haqíqí that, in light
of the authorities’ refusal to permit landing at Ottoman ports, it was
best to proceed to one of the nearby harbors in the Mediterranean,
such as Greece, Italy, France, or others. From there, we could
continue to Beirut [and eventually to ‘Akká].

We purchased passage on a Greek vessel and a week later
arrived at the Aegean Islands. This freighter was used to transport
poultry, and during this journey, as we sailed to different islands, our
sole entertainment was to watch roosters and chickens play.
Eventually we reached the port of Pierre in Greece, where we
sojourned for a day and toured the renowned city of Athens.

[Visit to Alexandria]
Once again, we acquired tickets on a ship destined for Alexandria in
Egypt. When we arrived at Alexandria, inasmuch as neither Haqíqí
nor I spoke the language nor were we acquainted with the culture, a
strange thing occurred: thinking we had arrived at Alexandretta,
Haqíqí somehow managed to ask an Arab pedestrian if he knew
‘Abdu’l-Mihdí Hakkák. He responded, “Yes, indeed. He has a shop
near the harbor where he makes seals. Come, I will direct you to
him.” On hearing this, without the least reservation, Khán Haqíqí
immediately followed him. His wife and this servant, however, were
left behind in the ship with no money or passport and bereft of
acquaintances.

The whole day passed without any news from Haqíqí.
Meanwhile, hungry and tired, we were stranded on the vessel, not

knowing when he might return. Soon the sirens indicated that the
ship was pulling anchor and was ready to sail, but still there was no
sign of Khán Haqíqí!

As our ship began pulling anchor, Khán [Haqíqí] appeared
accompanied by an Effendi15 and when I asked where he had been,
he answered, “There is no time now for such discussions. Help me
with the suitcases as we must leave the ship.” I did as bidden, and
we immediately disembarked.

A short while later, we arrived at the residence of Hájí
Muhammad Yazdí, brother of Áqá Ahmad Yazdí, who, with the
utmost hospitality and joy, invited us to stay with him for a few days.
After a short rest, I asked Mírzá Isháq Khán [Haqíqí] the reason for
his delay [in returning to the ship]. He responded, “I had been in
correspondence with ‘Abdu’l-Mihdí Hakkák in Alexandretta and
mistakenly thought that this city of Alexandria is the same town.
Moreover, the Arab we met further misdirected me. Therefore, after
recognizing my error and having thoroughly searched the city [for
Hakkák], I decided to locate the Bahá’ís, knowing they would come
to our aid. Gradually, and after much inquiry and effort, I found the
shops of the Iranian merchants and some of the believers. However,
fearing my intentions and the possibility that I was one of the
Covenant-breakers, they decided to thoroughly interrogate me. In
the midst of the questioning, the renowned and courageous Hájí
Mírzá Hasan Khurásání, much like a graceful lion or sharp saber,
entered [the room] and, seeing that we were engaged in arguing and
that I was being examined, interrupted the discussions and asked me
directly, ‘Are you a thábit or a náqid16?’ In the same fashion, I
replied, ‘By your life, I am firm in the Covenant!’ He rejoiced aloud;
and with that, the interrogation was concluded and we all embraced
and kissed each other in love and fellowship. He soon sent one of
his experienced attendants with me to fetch you and our belongings
from the ship and direct us to this location.”
15A term used in Ottoman Turkish for learned or prominent men.
16Those faithful to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá referred to themselves as thábit [steadfast] and to
the followers of Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí as náqid [Covenant-breakers].

It was evident that the foul odor of Covenant-breaking had
reached that region and that the steadfast friends exerted much
caution in their associations, as bidden “Do not consider every speaker
truthful, nor every caller firm in the Covenant.17” Therefore, they thought it
prudent to investigate each visitor, which fortunately [in our case],
concluded quickly through the intervention of Hájí Mírzá Hasan,
and allowed the friends and us to come together in fellowship and
enjoy each other’s company and discourse.

[In Beirut]
In short, after a few days of rest in Alexandria, we acquired passage
and sailed towards Beirut. On this voyage, because of an epidemic
among the [Muslim] pilgrims, we were twice stopped and
quarantined: once at the port of Sinope, near the Tarabuzan
[Dardaneiles], on the shore of the Black Sea, and again at [the
Customs Office of] Beirut.

After release from quarantine, we met the honored Áqá
Muhammad-Mustafa [Baghdádí], who was numbered among the
firm and learned friends, possessed a poetic and cultured
disposition, and in service to the Covenant and Testament was like a
sharpened sword. This steadfast and brave soldier of the Faith was
the son of the honored Shaykh Muhammad Shibl, who in his youth
had accompanied the illustrious Táhirih [from ‘Atabát] to Iran and
had devoted his life to the service of the Cause in the proximity of
the Holy Land. He was a communications center for the friends and
would forward Tablets to their destinations across the globe.18
17 A similar statement attributed to Bahá’u’lláh is quoted in a letter of the Greatest
Holy Leaf (Bahiyyih Khánum, pp. 218-219): “Place not your trust in every new arrival, and
believe not every speaker.”
18 Muhammad-Mustafa Baghdádí had settled in Beirut in 1880, establishing a trading

business in that city, with a branch office in Alexandrine; see, Moojan Momen ed.
“Esslemont’s survey of the Bahá’í community in 1919-20: Part VII: Iraq by Mírzá
Muhammad-Husayn Wakil,” Bahá’í Studies Bulletin, vol 3, no. 3 (September 1985), pp.
5-6. Shortly after Baghdádí’s family, Siyyid Hasan Afnán settled in Beirut and thus
the nucleus of the first Bahá’í community was formed in that city.

Moreover, he was specifically assigned to prevent dissemination of
the Covenant-breakers’ calumnies and to provide guidance to the
friends and pilgrims. He closely associated with prominent figures
and military generals of the Ottoman Empire and indeed served as
the frontline of defense for the Holy Land, and its foremost
protector.

In addition to shielding the Cause of God from various darts
and machinations from its enemies, he provided every possible
comfort and support to the Iranian students in that region, as well as
to visitors and pilgrims. He indeed served as a critical center of the
Cause and was its primary defense. He was a man of unique stature
who was deeply respected by friends and foes alike and in whose
presence no one dared insult the Cause or speak of it unjustly.
Indeed, meeting him has left an indelible impression on my soul.

The honored ‘Alí Ihsán made arrangements for our [travel]
papers, and soon we boarded a ship destined for Haifa. I should
note that toward the latter part of his life, although outwardly Áqá
Muhammad-Mustafa19 had lost his sight, yet through divine
confirmations, he possessed discerning eyes. He was blind, but light
filled his being. He was a lover of the Moon of the Covenant and
with great effect chanted verses he had composed. To this day, I
recall one or two verses of those lines, which I quote below, and
may the mercy of God be upon him:

O ‘Akká, indeed thou art the loftiest place for my Lord,

And thy Branch20 is my Master.
Thus the love of thy habitation is the ardent desire of my
heart,

But especially the love for Him Who dwelleth within
thee.

19 Muhammad-Mustafá had three sons who were all firm as a rock, and their names
were: Husayn Iqbál, ‘Alí Ihsán and Dr. Zia Baghdadi. (HM)
20 A reference to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who was styled the Most Mighty Branch by

Bahá’u’lláh.

And similarly:

> O the Branch of My Lord, Bahá:
My heart is burned up by the fire of Thy separation,

The heat of Thy parting consumes my inner being!

[Arrival in ‘Akká]
At that time, Haifa was a small and insignificant port where only a
few families lived. One of the friends [from Yazd], known as Áqá
Nasru’lláh Cháí-Chí [tea-server], had a humble coffeehouse across
from the wooden landing-pier, and arranged the affairs of the
pilgrims with the utmost wisdom.

Bay of Haifa circa 1905

We stayed at Haifa’s shore for only a short while and then
departed for ‘Akká.

Haifa Port

Our two-horse carriage journeyed the distance on the sandy beaches
and en route we sat quietly as we were wonder-struck by the beauty
of the sea, the majesty of God’s Mount Carmel and the approaching
city of ‘Akká. Our hearts quivered. As the city neared, our
trepidation and anticipation increased until we finally passed through
the iron city-gate and entered “The Strong City.”21 It was Friday, the
eighth of Dhi’l-Qa‘dih 1320 A.H.22 The streets of the city were very
narrow with exceptionally high walls made from limestone, which at
once evoked deep awe and wonder in us.

We arrived at a caravansary known as Khán-i ‘Umdán23, with a
courtyard filled with camels, horses and mules.24

21 Bahá’u’lláh in Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 144, states: “Lend an ear unto the song of
David. He saith: ‘Who will bring me into the Strong City?’ The Strong City is Akka, which hath
been named the Most Great Prison, and which possesseth a fortress and mighty ramparts.”
22 As the text consistently refers to 1907 as the date of this pilgrimage, it is believed

1320 is a typist error and the correct date should be 8 Dhi’l-Qa‘dih 1325 A.H.,
which corresponds to 13 December 1907. Khátirát Habíb, vol. 2, p. 21, gives the
arrival date as “Friday 8 Dhi’l-Qa‘dih 1329 A.H. (1907)” which corresponds to
Tuesday 31 October 1911 and is clearly inconsistent with other chronological data in
this narrative. Therefore, “1329” is also considered a typist error.
23 Khátirát Habíb, vol. 1, pp. 12 (and 1:9) incorrectly refers to it as Khán-i ‘Umrán.

This caravanserai is also known as Khán-i Avamid (the Inn of the Pillars) or Khán-i
Jurayni. For more details see Door of Hope, p. 38 and p. 75.
24 For a description see The Chosen Highway, pp. 230-231 and Door of Hope, pp. 75-76.

Filth and dirt enveloped everything. Unwashed Arabs and
persistent mosquitoes were a source of great irritation. An inn,
known among the Arabs as Khán-i ‘Avámíd [the inn of the pillars],
was the stopping place for the caravans carrying goods, grains and
fruits. On the second floor, the friends of God had leased a few
rooms where they resided. They utilized one section as a pilgrim
house while the adjacent and connecting rooms were occupied by
such resident believers as the honored Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí25,
25   For autobiography see Stories from Delights of Heart.

Zaynu’l-Muqarrabin26, Mishkin-Qalam27, and some others.

These souls had closed their eyes to all the pleasures of earthly
life, had forsaken all the comforts of present society, had renounced
all the ease of modern civilization, and had fixed their gaze solely on
the face of the Beloved. They consumed but little food, had
abandoned desires or attachments to worldly affairs, and longed to
attain [‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s] presence, hold fast to the hem of His
garment, hear His voice, partake of His bounties, and taste the joy
and wisdom of His sweet, heavenly utterances. Beholding His
countenance and hearing His eloquent words <10> was the source
of their satisfaction and hope, and allowed them to renounce every
regard and affection for this world.

‘Akká (Acre) circa 1900

What serene lives they led! What spiritual, resplendent and
unrestrained men they were! What tranquil and joyous atmosphere
26   For biography see Memorials of the Faithful, pp. 150-153.
27   For biography see Memorials of the Faithful, pp. 97-101.

they had created, causing one to forget all the affairs, the pains, and
the cares of this world! No sorrow, no anguish, no avarice, no greed,
no lust, no attachment, no anger, no dispute, no concern for today
or tomorrow, no political conniving, no craving for rank or position
– none of these were allowed into those hallowed and ethereal
surroundings. Indeed, it seemed as if the promised Kingdom had
materialized and the inhabitants of this celestial place had become
the embodiment of what Sa‘dí28, upon whom rest the mercy of God,
described:

If you grant me the choice on the Day of Resurrection,

friendship would suffice me, while I leave all the
bounties of paradise to you.

Through self-effacement, self-sacrifice and self-renunciation,
and through the breath of the life-generating Divine Breeze, they
had attained the station of the true seeker. Their ego had left and
spirituality had filled its place. They had indeed become spirit
reincarnated. [As the poet has versed:]

Man can reach a summit that beholds naught save God,

Lo, how lofty is the station of man!

The sight and insight of those that have witnessed the
instability and infirmity of this world and its dwellers, and have
comprehended the end of things, and determined the volatility of
the present order, and renounced all material desires is summed up
in [the Arabic proverb], “The sweetness of it is as tribulation, and its
reprimands like unto a passing cloud.” That is, earthly enjoyments
are mirage, not reality. They are ephemeral, not lasting. To those
endowed with understanding material pleasures are naught save
childish desires – a fleeing delight – followed by darkness and
gloom.
28 Sa‘dí is the famed writer of Shiraz whose prose and verse remain among the
foremost examples of Persian literary achievement.

Therefore, these things were unworthy of their attention as
they did pass the stage of vain imaginings and arrived at certainty
and understanding of the purpose of creation.

How true indeed were the penetrating insight and faithful
sentiments of the renowned poet of Shiraz, Sa‘dí, upon whom rest
the mercy of God:

The world is not worth the envy that it produces in them,

they grieve for either its existence or its non-existence.
Indeed, one must admit that those who have the proper view,

are those who have not cast their vision at this heap of
> dust.
Whatever the true knowers cannot find firm and permanent,

even if it is the entire kingdom of the world, they will not
> pay anything for it.
Unless you disapprove of haughtiness and arrogance,

by God, in the kingdom there are many beasts like you.29

My God, what had these sanctified souls seen or experienced
that, in such wise, they had relinquished all the pleasures of the
world and had decided to remain in this prison-city of ‘Akká, with
its foul air and water, a citadel for the most criminally-minded, a
place more nefarious than any other?

This town was devoid of every merit or advantage. Even air
and sun were reluctant to approach it. It was a prison for the
enemies of the powerful monarchs of the Ottoman Empire, and the
permanent grave for murderers, thieves, highwaymen, rabble-rousers
and the most dangerous criminals of the realm. Anyone who
received the judgment of banishment from any part of the Ottoman
Kingdom – be it regions in Europe, Asia, or Africa – was sent to
this prison-city, whence no hope of return could ever be entertained.
It was a Bridge of Sighs30 that allowed no return.
29 The present translator is grateful to Prof Alan Godlas for his kind assistance in
rendering these lines by Sa‘dí.
30 The Roman Emperors in Venice, Italy, constructed the Bridge of Sighs, where

However, for discerning souls, it was a verdant and flourishing
orchard, with musk-laden scent. From the hair of its camels we
inhaled the fragrance of life, and from its fleas31 and flies we heard
the melody of divine verses. From its walls and owls we perceived
the Songs of David, and from its prison and captivity wafted the
sweet perfume of the garment of Joseph. Blessed are those who
come upon it, happy are those that attain unto it, and glad tidings be
upon them that visit it.

[First Pilgrimage]
During this first pilgrimage, I had the privilege of staying for nearly a
month, that is, nineteen days, while Mírzá Isháq Khán Haqíqí was
present, and then eleven more days with the Hamadání pilgrims [of
Jewish descent]. Day and night I had the bounty of beholding
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s countenance and drinking my fill of His engaging
utterances. Sometimes I was thrilled to the depths of my soul and at
other instances my tears flowed unceasingly. From the rapture of
this wine of union, I was so intoxicated that I beheld no world save
the realm of spirit and the paradise above.

Because of the provocations of the Covenant-breakers and the
machinations of the Ottoman authorities, pilgrims could not attain
the presence of the Master collectively. Often, two by two, we would
walk the narrow alleys from the pilgrim house to the Master’s
residence.32 These alleys were so narrow that if a pedestrian came

criminals sentenced to life-imprisonment would pass over on their way to
permanent captivity. (HM)
31 The congestion of ‘Akká’s fleas is well beyond the imagination of those that have

not experienced it. I recall that while in Khán-i ‘Umdán, my feet were covered with
them, much like wearing a black boot. In this regard, it is revealed in a hadith, “And
if you were bitten by one of its [i.e. ‘Akká’s] fleas, that would be more meritorious
before God than sustaining a severe injury by an arrow in the path of the Almighty.”
(HM) Compare with hadith cited in, Bahá’u’lláh, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 79,
“He that hath been bitten by one of its fleas is better, in the estimation of God, than
he who hath received a grievous blow in the path of God.”
32 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and His family lived at that time in a spacious building known as the

from the opposite direction, we had to press our backs against the
wall to let him pass. However, when we arrived at the Master’s
house, particularly on the night that we gathered at His reception
hall, we would be galvanized by the vivifying atmosphere,
particularly when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá began to speak. His utterance had
such a profound effect on the audience that it seemed to penetrate
the very depths of one’s soul and being.

His words often centered on the harm and injury perpetrated
upon His Holiness the Exalted One [i.e. the Báb] and the Blessed

House of ‘Abdu’llah Pasha. It was in this building that the remains of the Báb were
secretly kept for a decade and that Shoghi Effendi was born.

Beauty [i.e. Bahá’u’lláh] and the opposition of the wayward, the
sufferings the martyrs sustained at the hand of the ungodly and the
detachment of the Chosen Ones of God. Occasionally He would
speak of the infidelity of the followers of Yahya [Azal] and the
wickedness of the violators of the divine Covenant. Afterwards, a
Qur’án reciter would come in and, once he had received permission
to sit, would chant Qur’ánic verses in a Hijází or Egyptian style; and
when the Master said, “Sidq Alláh33”, he would immediately stop. At
that time, Áqá Husayn Ashchí34 would serve coffee, and
subsequently all would take their leave.

The tradition was that twice a week, on Friday and Sunday
afternoons, we visited the sacred Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, the Point of
Adoration of the dwellers of the Celestial Paradise. These visits were
always the same and consisted of Isfandíyár going back and forth
several times, taking the friends from ‘Akká to Bahjí in his carriage.

33 lit. Truthfully said God.
34   He joined Bahá’u’lláh’s household in Baghdad and remained with them
throughout various exiles. He eventually passed away in the Holy Land in 1925. His
fascinating memories are available at: Áqá Husayn Ashchí, Táríkh Vaqá’i‘ Baghdad va
Istanbul va Edirne va ‘Akká (Lansing, MI: H-Bahai, 1997) at
http://ahang.rabbani.googlepages.com/ and rendered into English by the present
translator at the same internet site.

There was a small pilgrim house near the Shrine where the
believers would wash their hands and face, refresh themselves, and
perform their ablutions. They would also be served tea and chant
prayers, often led by Mírzá Mahmúd Káshí. When all the pilgrims
and some of the resident believers had assembled, calmly and
reverently, with hands folded over chest, we would walk to the
Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh; and afterwards, in the same manner, we would
return.

Once or twice during the week, we would visit the Ridván35

and the Firdaws36 Gardens, as well as Tellu’l-Hamrá [the crimson
hill] and ‘Aynu’l-Baqar [spring of the cow]37.

35 For description see, David Ruhe, Door of Hope, pp. 95-102.
36 For description see David Ruhe, Door of Hope, pp. 102-103.
37 The spring is named from the Muslim legend that Adam watered his ox here,

hence among other descriptions the spring-water is thought to be healing to oxen.
This spring is mentioned by Bahá’u’lláh in Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 178 and p.
180, and joining another spring, ‘Ayn’u-Sitt [the spring of women], it flows to the
east of ‘Akká, though their combined volume is inadequate for the city. For more

It continued in this fashion until our allotted period of
pilgrimage was concluded and instructions for departure were
received. Since the plan was for me to go to the United States, the
American pilgrims, such as [Helen] Goodall and [her daughter Ella]
Cooper of San Francisco, were informed; and even in a general
nightly meeting of the friends, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá specified that I should
travel with the American friends and in consultation with them enter
a university in America. He also remarked:

The Blessed Beauty has provided the means for
> the unification of the world of humanity and has
> removed religious and social conflicts. No longer is a
> person to be defined by such labels as Jewish or
> Christian. All are embraced by the effulgence of the
> Faith, and all dwell beneath the tabernacle of unity.

What occurred at that time was: the honored Hakím Hárún
Hamadáni threw himself at ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s feet and pleaded with
Him that I may be permitted to undertake the same study at Beirut
College [instead of going to the United States]. He entreated, “We
know him [i.e. Habíb Mú’ayyad] and are acquainted with his
background. We implore You to allow him to study in Beirut where
he can associate with other Bahá’í youth.” A little while later, I was
summoned into the presence [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. I went in, bowed
down and was greeted with the customary, “Marhabá38!” Afterwards
the billowing ocean of His utterance surged and His all-embracing
grace and compassion surrounded me. He remarked, “Your
honored friends have made such a request, but what do you say?”
“Whatever is Your good wish,” I responded. “The Blessed Beauty
has stated,” He commented, “‘My pleasure is in the pleasure of My
creatures.’”39

details see, David Ruhe, Door of Hope, pp. 125-126.
38 Lit. Well done, or welcome.
39 Bahá’u’lláh’s Persian Hidden Words, no. 43, states: “O My Friends! Walk ye in the ways

of the good pleasure of the Friend, and know that His pleasure is in the pleasure of His creatures.

[Visit to Jewish Holy Places]
In short, it was decided for me to go to Beirut. Therefore, the
American friends left and I remained for a few more days until the
Hamadání believers were also dismissed, at which time I
accompanied them. During this time, whatever He uttered and all
that He commanded regarding travel in the Holy Land, applied to
me as well. For instance, regarding the ancient holy places, He
All of these were the dwelling-places of the

That is: no man should enter the house of his friend save at his friend's pleasure, nor lay hands
upon his treasures nor prefer his own will to his friend's, and in no wise seek an advantage over
him. Ponder this, ye that have insight!”
40 I should note that at that time, that is, in 1907, the word “Palestine” was not

commonly employed, as this area was under the Ottoman rule and was part of [the
province of] Syria. Some of the Ashkenazi Jews referred to it as “Palistin” or “The

You must go and with utmost reverence,
veneration and humility visit these holy sites.

Afterwards, I returned to the pilgrim house and was pondering
His words. Soon I was overcome with evil thoughts and was tested
spiritually. I thought – and I take refuge in God! – perhaps the
Master has erred and is not aware that I have come in this direction
to further my education and, since I missed the opportunity to leave
for America, I must now proceed to Beirut for this purpose.
Possibly He was thinking that I was part of the group of pilgrims of
Jewish descent and like them must now visit Jerusalem and other
sacred spots. It is likely that such a delay would prevent me from
Land of Israel.” (HM)
41 Israel means, “hasten unto God,” and was a title of Jacob, father of Joseph.

enrolling in the university and cause irreparable damage to my
academic pursuits. Moreover, I do not have the funds for such a
journey, nor the desire to become a “Hájí”, and I do not think that
one who has visited Bahá’í Holy Places needs to see other spots. I
said to myself:

Hájí goes for the Ka‘bih and I too seek a pilgrimage,

he searches for the House, but I the Builder of the
House.

In short, such thoughts perplexed and disturbed me. In the
pilgrim house I was sharing these concerns with the honored Hájí
Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí when, suddenly, one of the attendants entered the
room and informed me, “You have been summoned [by the
Master].” Immediately I went to His sacred presence and bowed
down. He greeted me with “Marhabá!” and showered upon me
expressions of bounty and grace. He made further remarks, which
were approximately these:

All of this land is the Holy Land, and it bears
> traces of the footsteps of the Divine Prophets.
> Therefore, every grain of it is sacred and sanctified. The

The Wailing Wall in Jerusalem

Together with the Hamadání pilgrims of Jewish descent, using
horses and mules, we set out on this journey and for the following
two weeks traveled from village to village.42 Nightly, as we visited
each place, we heard from the Jews wondrous and remarkable
stories pertaining to the miracles associated with each spot. With
utmost respect and admiration, we listened to these accounts and,
with hands extended beyond the sleeves of our ‘abás, we stood in
prayer by each of the sacred tombs, reverently kissing the holy
ground.

[In Beirut]
After a long journey to the Jewish sites, eventually I arrived at the
American University in Beirut and after taking an examination,
entered the fifth year of high school.43 I must note that I should

have been enrolled in college classes, but since my school
certification from the American school in Hamadán44 was not
authenticated, the school board consulted and decided that I should
write an essay of 500 words in English on the history and teachings
of the Bahá’í Faith. They determined to accept this paper in lieu of
the entrance test requirements. Fortunately, as I had studied various
[Bahá’í] pamphlets and booklets received from the United States, I
was familiar with such big and prestigious words as “Manifestation”
and “Divine Civilization”, and some others.45

At the appointed time, I quickly penned a section on the
history of the Cause, the Most Great Manifestation, and sacrifices of
the martyrs in Iran, and devoted another section to whatever of the
teachings I recalled. In all, two full pages were written and presented
to Professor Hull, the chairman of the department. He was very
impressed by my composition, which saved me a myriad troubles
and allowed me to enter the final year of high school. From that
date, which was early 1908, I enrolled as a boarding student in the
S.P.C. [Syrian Protestant College]46 and began to attend regular
classes.

44  Because of religious impediments and socio-economic factors, many Iranian
Bahá’ís sent their children to the primary and secondary schools of Protestant
missionaries – which the diarist attended – or to those of Alliance Israelite
Universelle, or the Zoroastrian Amelioration Society, which also had Western
curricula; see, John Elder, Tarikh Misiyun Amrikai dar Iran, (Tehran: 1966); Mary
Boyce, “Maneckji Limji Hataria in Iran,” Cama Oriental Institute Jubilee volume
(Bombay: 1969) pp. 19-27.
45 The language of instruction at the Protestant missionary schools in Iran was

English; see, John Elder, Tarikh Misiyun Amrikai dar Iran, p. 36.
46 Since 1922, the Syrian College is known as the American University of Beirut. For

a study of Bahá’í students in this college see the forthcoming article by Richard
Hollinger, “An Iranian Enclave in Lebanon: Bahá’í Students in Beirut, 1906-1940”

Further Notes on the First Pilgrimage47

Second Preface [By the Author]
It should not elude men of insight that it was in my youth that I was
granted the privilege of attaining the presence of His Holiness
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. At that time, I was neither overly concerned with
spiritual issues, nor with matters pertaining to the world hereafter.
My sole desire was to behold the luminous countenance of the
Master, and, in a state of rapture, listen to Him speak. Hence, being
unaware of their future significance, the notes I kept were very
abbreviated, intended principally to aid me to remember the events
of those days and the sweetness and joy of being in His presence.
With pen or pencil, I recorded the essence of whatever I perceived
to be important or beneficial in a small pocketbook that I always
carried with me. Therefore the utterances of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
[presented in this diary] are not His exact words, but rather, what I
recalled after I had returned to the pilgrim house, when I committed
them to paper, often using my own inadequate expressions.

Little did I imagine that one day these [records] would be of
interest to the friends or be worthy of submission before the sacred
presence of the Guardian of the Cause of God. Had I anticipated
such an eventuality, I would have prepared several mighty books of
the utterances of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and recorded the very words as
spoken by Him, as each of those words is endowed with a myriad
spiritual potentialities. Alas, this thought occurred too late to me,
and the little that could be assembled and copied from my various
scattered papers is mostly from the time shortly after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
had returned from His European and American travels. I, as well, at

47 This chapter represents diary notes kept by Dr. Mú’ayyad during his first visit to
‘Akká from 13 December 1907 to 13 January 1908 and reproduced in Khátirát, vol.
1, 25-81 (17-58).

His bidding, had sojourned in Europe and learned modern customs
from the Europeans, including the keeping of notes on important
matters.

Utterances of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá During My First Pilgrimage

> to ‘Akká, Dhi’l-Qa‘dih 132948 A.H./1907

in the House of ‘Abdu’lláh Páshá Jazzár

When I first attained ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence, I threw myself
at His feet and was about to kiss them, when His blessed hands
48As noted in the earlier chapter, 1329 is a typist error and the correct year should
be 1325 A.H. Dhi’l-Qa‘dih 1325 A.H., which corresponds to 6 December 1907
through 4 January 1908.

lifted me, saying, “Astaghfuru’lláh, astaghfuru’lláh!49 We will
embrace, we will hug!” After He had lovingly inquired of the journey
and our difficulties en route, He spoke of the Blessed Beauty’s visit
to Kirmánsháh [on His way to Baghdad]. He remarked:

How bitterly cold was that winter! We arrived at a
> caravansary located by a moat. The journey was full of
> sufferings and difficulties, but since it was in the path of
> God, it was filled with joy and delight, and we were so
> happy. In Asadábád it was particularly cold. The
> temperature was 38 degrees below zero. My socks were
> wet, which caused my feet to be frostbitten. That
> evening we were to eat some halvah. By mistake,
> however, pepper had been added in place of sugar,
> which severely burned our mouths and throats. That
> night we did not sleep, and constantly drank water. From
> the blessings of those adversities, those banishments,
> now the banner of the Divine Faith is hoisted most high!

A picture of the believers of Qazvín was presented, which
‘Abdu’l-Bahá kissed several times and said, “These resplendent
friends;” “countenances illumined by the light of Bahá;” “well-
pleasing gift;” and “with bright faces they fix their gaze on their
Lord!”

[Hardship Endured by the Prophets]
Regarding the many exiles of Bahá’u’lláh and His banishment from
Iran to ‘Iraq, Constantinople, Adrianople, and eventually to ‘Akká,
Abraham’s    migration   precipitated the
manifestation and appearance of Moses, Christ,

Regarding the migration of one of the Páshás who had been
killed in the Arab-French war, He commented:

However, the migration and wandering of Abraham

In another instance, He spoke the following comments:

[Spiritual Orientation]
After we returned from visiting the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh and
attained the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, He remarked:

Pilgrimage has to do with one’s soul and,
depending on one’s approach, one benefits accordingly.

57 A reference to the legendary arch of the Sassanian palace. In 1915, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

prophesized that a Mashriqu’l-Adhkar will be raised over the same spot which will
incorporate the restored arch of the royal palace. See, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Memorials of the
Faithful, p. 20.

59   Shaykh Fadlu’lláh was a Shi‘ite cleric from Mázandarán. He was ashamed that the

[Bahá’í Hostels]
My father, the late Hájí Khudábakhsh Mú’ayyad, had built a hostel in
the village of Sahnih60 for the comfort of travelers and, to the extent
of his abilities, showed hospitality to both Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í
wayfarers. When his name was mentioned was made in ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s sacred presence, He remarked:

This is very wonderful! The friends of God must
> do the same in every town and hamlet and provide a
> befitting place for the comfort of the itinerant believers
> so that when they go from town to town, they know that
> in a fixed location such hospitality is provided for them.

> tumult and turmoil, and yet it is a mother that will
> constantly give birth. The Mashriqu’l-Adhkár is a magnet
> that attracts divine confirmations and draws divine
> assistance.

[Arrival of the Vakílu’d-Dawlih]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke ceaselessly in praise of Hájí [Mírzá Muhammad-
Taqí] Vakílu’d-Dawlih Afnán61, and further remarked, “They wanted
to take the honored Afnán directly to Jeddah. In these days, travel is
extremely difficult. The [Iranian] travelers are not permitted to

disembark in any of the Ottoman harbors, but instead are taken
directly from Batum to Jeddah.”

At the time of the arrival of the honored Hájí Vakílu’d-Dawlih
Afnán, the sea was turbulent; and when he was going from the ship
into a boat, the waves overwhelmed the boat, and the honored
Afnán fell into the sea. With great difficulty, the sailors rescued him.
Upon his arrival in ‘Akká, His Holiness ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to us, “Let
us go and visit the honored Afnán.” When he saw the Master, with
trembling body, he threw himself at ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s feet. The Master
tenderly inquired of him, “Illustrious Afnán, today was most
arduous on you. How are you?” The Afnán burst out weeping
uncontrollably as pearl-like tears flowed down his white beard. Then
with a broken and weak voice, he recited a verse, “Thy presence I
craved, to unburden to Thee my heart,” but the outpouring of tears
did not allow him to say the second verse of the couplet as he
unceasingly and bitterly wept. Witnessing his condition, all those
present were overcome with emotions and wept profusely.

[A Humorous Story]
Today, the Master was very cheerful and jubilant and wished for all
the friends to be joyful as well. For this reason, He told us a story
about Jamál Burújirdí:

‘Alaviyyih Khánum, the wife of the martyred Mullá
> ‘Alí Jan [Mafuzaki], had a dream which she recounted to
> Jamál Burújirdí.62 She said, “I dreamt that Jamál Mubárak
> [the Blessed Beauty] came to this room and graciously
> spoke in praise of me.” In response, Jamál Burújirdí had
> remarked, “Yes, this is a true dream, for I have now
> come and am showing kindness to you!”
62 Áqá Jamál Burújirdí was among the most prominent believers in the time of
Bahá’u’lláh, who had a strong base of support in such places as Qazvín, Tihrán and
Mázandarán, including Mafuzak a village near Sari of Mázandarán. After Burújirdí’s
rebellion against ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, he lost his following and prestige.

It would have been good if she had dealt with
> Jamál Burújirdí the same way that the Princess dealt with
> a homely suitor. One time, the Princess had fallen in love
> with Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar Khán Núrí. She was informed
> that a visitor had come and was sitting in the guestroom.
> Thinking that this was the same Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar Khán
> Núrí, she had taken a lantern and quickly entered the
> room only to find a homely and sickly-looking man
> sitting there. With both hands she had hit him in the
> head such that his hat was torn, and loudly she had cried,
> “Is this you Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar Khán Núrí? Is it really you
> Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar? How despicable you look, Mírzá ‘Alí-
> Akbar!”

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Bounties]
Afterwards, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá summoned me alone into His presence

and, after showering His infinite bounties upon me, remarked:

Marhabá! Praise be unto God that you traversed
> the lands, the seas, the islands, the meadows, the hills
> and the valleys until at last you arrived at this resplendent
> realm and attained this spiritual gathering! This is naught
but a sign of the purity of your motive!

All the people of the world arose to exterminate
> the descendants of Abraham63, but they failed. Truly, this
> is by reason of your faith and fidelity. “He bestows
God’s bounties upon whomsoever He wishes.”

I am well pleased with you since in the Abhá
> Kingdom you have brought joy and felicity to the spirit
> of your illustrious Ancestor, Abraham. The prophecies
> of the Prophets were foretold for your time.

I stated, “I spent four years of my elementary education
[living] in the home of the honored Hájí Músá Kalímí [Jewish],
whose immense kindness constantly surrounded me and who
exerted much effort for my sake. He has offered the gift of a silver
candelabrum for Your august presence and has beseeched divine
confirmations.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá replied, “Very well. For a few nights, I
will keep the candelabrum on my nightstand. Afterwards, you are to
take it to the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh and, with your own hands, place
it there. This bounty is being bestowed upon Hájí Músá for the
generosity he has shown you.” He also revealed a Tablet in his
honor that is quoted below:

Through the honored pilgrim, Áqá Mírzá Habíbu’lláh, son
> of Khudábakhsh, [for the attention of] the honored Áqá Músá
> Kalímí, upon whom rest the Glory of God, the Most Glorious!

He is God.

‘A ‘A.

In a general meeting of the friends, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated the
following:

It rained all last night, which kept Me up. Farmers
> must be thankful for the divine bounties that help them
> reap the fruits of their labors. People should likewise be
> grateful that the outpourings of divine grace cause
> verdant greens and choice fruits to come from their

[Dealing With Opposition]
For some time I had benefited from the tutelage of the American
Mr. N. L. Euver, the principal of the American school in Hamadán,
where I had completed my primary education.65 He had had high
hopes to baptize me and convert me to Christianity. When he heard
that I was leaving for ‘Akká, he wrote me, expressing great regret
[for this decision], and referred to me as “a follower of the false
Christ.” With much sympathy, he had lamented over my
“waywardness.” This letter and the painful thoughts it evoked

65 As noted earlier, this was a small Presbyterian school established in early 1900’s
which grew from a home school to a formal school. In 1930s it moved to Tihrán
and was absorbed by the Tehran American School. For details see:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_High_School_Tehran,_Iran

continued to agitate me. Throughout the entire course of the
journey [to the Holy Land] and whenever I had a spare moment, I
had been composing a response filled with verses from the Bible,
proving that indeed it was he who was the antichrist for having been
so heedless towards the Person of the Manifestation.

I presented my thick proof-treatise to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and shared
the details of the situation with Him. “Nay, nay!” He advised, “You
are not to send this treatise. Do not write such things to the
Americans. It will cause rancor. It will suffice to write, ‘Since you
have been my teacher, I will never forget your efforts and your
kindness. You are my spiritual father and will remain forever in my
prayers.’ This should be enough.” I wrote according to His
instructions and destroyed the treatise I had composed.

Regarding a polemic pamphlet that was published in Tihrán,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated:

People are exerting [great efforts] to extinguish the
> Light of God. They have written and will write many
> polemics, as they recently wrote in Tihrán. However,
> they do not understand that these polemics will only
> serve to propagate the Word of God. They will not be
> able to deny the Sun its radiance. If the entire world were
> to unite, it could never stop the surging billows of this
> ocean. With but one wave, it will discard all the froth and
> deadwood. Of course, the believers are vigilant to deal
> with such accusations convincingly. Those that serve the
> Cause, according to the explicit Text, are promised
> ultimate victory: “We… shall aid whosoever will arise for the
> triumph of Our Cause with the hosts of the Concourse on high and
> a company of Our favored angels.”66 That is, with invisible
> hosts, the Almighty will support and preserve the
> servants of the Cause.

66   Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb Aqdas, K53.

<25> Addressing Mírzá Mihdí Rashtí, Mashhadí Bába and
Karbalá’í ‘Umrán Bádkúbih’í, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked:

Mírzá Mihdí, how is your health? I am sure you
> have endured much hardship? It is most befitting to
> suffer troubles in the path of the Beloved. Consider the
> animals. The more delicate they are, the more their labor.
> Stones and rocks are given no burden. But the trees are
> assigned relatively more responsibilities. And yet more is
> expected of the animal, particularly those with a voice,
> and beyond them, man, who has more strain than all the
> rest. There is a Turkish poem that conveys this
> concept.67 It is:

Collyrium must endure great hardship,

> Be burnt, and crushed and mixed with dye
> Before it is worthy of the beloved’s eye.

[Benefits of Public Institutions]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá further noted:

Whatever is public is divine, and whatever is
> private is devised of man.68 Therefore, whatever is
> established by the friends of God must be public,
> whether a Mashriqu’l-Adhkár, or other institutions.
> Whatever is public is divine, and whatever is private is
> manmade. The efforts of the friends must benefit all
> people. Recently, [the Bahá’ís] have founded a school
> and plan to build a hospital associated with the
> Mashriqu’l-Adhkár [of ‘Ishqábád]. If the believers
> undertake philanthropic efforts, it must be public and
67 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá quotes two Turkish couplets.
68 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Will and Testament, p. 13, reveals, “Universality is of God, and all
limitations earthly.”

> not exclusionary against anyone. For instance, if they
> establish a school, none must be denied entrance. It
> pleases Me when the friends show utmost charity in all
> that they build, as in the Mashriqu’l-Adhkár of
> ‘Ishqábád, which is firmly established in that region. His
> Holiness the Exalted One [The Báb] has revealed,
> ‘Whatever is built on a firm foundation will receive
> God’s confirmations and blessings.’

The Incident of the Rabid Dog
Very quickly a dog entered the reception hall and hid under the
chairs. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá commanded, “Chase out this untamed dog! It
is dirty and unsightly. Chase it out!” Áqá Siyyid Asadu’lláh Qumí
went to chase the dog outside when the dog bit him. The Master
ordered, “Slay him! Slay the dog!” Quickly the attendants rushed
forth and with sticks and shovels attacked and killed the dog. Then
it was discovered that it was rabid and had already bitten a few other
people who had contracted the disease.69 In front of the door of the
inner quarters, the dog was killed, and Áqá Siyyid Asadu’lláh Qumí
was instructed to proceed to Constantinople for a remedy.
Immediately, this wise old man departed for Constantinople, where
he stayed for two months until he was cured.70

The Bahá’í Mr. Dodd71
[‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked:]

The Reuters news agency telegraphed that a Bahá’í

69 It should be noted that at the time rabies was a death sentence – that is, incurable.
70 At that time, ‘Akká was a particularly polluted city, with people living in close
quarters, and special care had to be taken to protect the population. As there were
no facilities for quarantine of sick animals, there was no alternative but to put a
dangerous animal to death quickly.

In the Orient scatter perfumes,

And shed splendors on the West.
Carry light unto the Bulgar,

And the Slav with life invest.72

In a letter I wrote, “Soon will the East and the

the same Tablet confirms that this poem was composed a year after the passing of
Bahá’u’lláh.

[Ever-Advancing Process]
In a gathering hosted by Mírzá Mihdí Áqá Akhaván-Safa and Mírzá
Habíbu’lláh Samímí and held in ‘Akká’s pilgrim house, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
The Ottoman Ambassador in America has written

The Honored Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl

Regarding the honored Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl, [‘Abdu’l-Bahá commented
as follows]:

Even though he is old and very frail, Mírzá Abú’l-
> Fadl devotes night and day to the service of the Cause of

> weak and delicate. America’s climate was too cold and

> and suffers from chest pains. He could not survive in
> those conditions, otherwise he would not have returned.
> He has served the Faith most diligently and has
sustained much hardship.

They have sent a photograph of him [from
> America] that is very interesting. With his turban and

[On Divinity]

Mírzá Mihdí Akhaván-Safá asked, “In the Qur’án it is revealed,
‘Uzair [Ezra] a Son of God.’”74 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá interpreted:

There were certain tribes in the old times, which
> no longer exist, such as Samaris or Pharisiyan. Another
> such tribe was Uzairiyh [who are no longer extant], and
> in much the same way that the Christians today refer to
> Christ as the Son of God, they referred to Uzair [Ezra]
as the Son of God.

The background is that the people and the chiefs
> of Nijran and Fady came to Medina and attained the

laid down such a law ...”76

74 The complete Qur’ánic verse (9:30) is: The Jews call Uzair a son of God, the Christians
call Christ a son of God. That is a saying from their mouths; (in this) they but imitate what the
unbelievers of old used to say. God’s curse be on them: how they are deluded away from the truth!

[A Teacher for India]

81 Matthew 26:41 reads, “Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the
spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.” Mark 14:38 states essentially the same.

Áqá Mírzá Mihdí Rashtí departed for a teaching trip to India, and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá [wished him well and] stated, “Honored Áqá Mírzá
Mihdí:

The Indian parrots will become sweet-toothed,

from this Pársí sweet going to Bengal.82

God willing, you will be confirmed, successful and triumphant.

There was an Áqá Muhammad Javád of Turkish background who
would recite this poem with his delightful accent.”

‘Akká’s Pilgrim House
The pilgrim house of ‘Akká consisted of a large room facing the sea
and was on the eastern side of the city (located in Khán-i ‘Avámíd or
otherwise known as Khán-i ‘Umdán). Two rooms with stone walls
were built on its western flank where the honored Hájí Mírzá
Haydar-‘Alí and the esteemed Mishkín-Qalam resided. There was
another room on the eastern side, which opened into the hallway
and served as the kitchen, where visitors removed their shoes.

A parrot lived in a cage and whenever ‘Abdu’l-Bahá entered
the room, in a loud and clear voice the parrot would say, “Allah-u-
Abhá!” He would say this with such resonance that it could be heard
from a considerable distance. Occasionally he would say,
“Marhabá!” and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would smile and respond “Allah-u-
Abhá!”

82The poem is by Háfiz and was composed when he planned a journey to India – a
journey that he never completed. The same verse appears at the beginning of
Bahá’u’lláh’s renowned Lawh Shikar-Shikan Shavand (The Bahá’í World Volume, vol.
18, p. 11) revealed in response to the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mírzá Sa‘íd Khan,
who had suggested that Bahá’u’lláh leave Baghdad in favor of India – a scheme that
Bahá’u’lláh foiled and rejected. “Pársí” means Zoroastrian, and some modern
scholars (e.g. Du Guftar by Delárám Mashhúrí) have argued that Háfiz was a
Zoroastrian.

The honored Áqá Muhammad-Hasan Khádim [servant], who
was corpulent but very agile and efficient, arranged all the affairs of
the pilgrims. Single-handedly, he prepared the pilgrims’ meals three
times a day, cleaned the rooms, shopped for provisions, cooked,
washed the dishes, set the sufrih83, served tea, and even occasionally
washed the pilgrims’ clothing. The meals were very simple and
unceremonial. They typically consisted of a simple broth, at times
served with yogurt.

[In the mornings,] he would bring water, fire up the samovar
and serve breakfast that consisted of some pure wheat bread with
one or two cups of sweetened tea. Then he would go to the bazaar
and purchase meat, potatoes, onions, and other necessities. Once he
had returned, he would commence making the broth. Afterwards, he
would bring wheat flour, make the dough, and by late morning
would carry a large pan of dough, often over his head, to the bakery.
Once the bread was made, he would bring it back to the pilgrim
house wrapped in a white tablecloth and would begin his other
work. Very calmly, about an hour past noon, sometimes two, when
all were hungry, he would spread the sufrih and place on it plates of
raw vegetables and cheese. Each pilgrim was served some broth that
contained one or two pieces of meat, about two pieces of potatoes
and an occasional tomato.

All the pilgrims were the same and considered equal. All types
of backgrounds, rich and poor, young and old, urbane and villager,

83   Tablecloth, typically spread on the floor at mealtime.

and people of various religious descents could be found among the
pilgrims. However, there was no favoritism or discrimination in their
ranks whatsoever, nor was there any luxury or self-indulgence. In
fact, during their free time, the pilgrims were asked to assist in sifting
wheat. Each person would pour about a pound of wheat on a paper
or a tray and, seed by seed, separate good seeds from the rejects.
Áqá Muhammad-Hasan would take the good seeds to the mill, and
then bring back bags of flour to the pilgrim house where he would
make the dough. After he made bread with it in the bakery, the
pilgrims themselves enjoyed the product. What wonderful taste and
what great joy were concealed in this collaborative effort. Nothing
else could compare with it. With utmost eagerness and delight the
pilgrims, often numbering in excess of thirty or forty, ate this bread
all by itself, and such joy would overcome them that it can never be
described. Another reason why the bread was so satisfying was that
Áqá Muhammad-Hasan was unable to serve lunch or dinner at the
standard mealtime. Therefore, being very hungry, we pilgrims ate the
bread with the greatest pleasure and enthusiasm. Indeed, no food
can ever hope to rival the delight of that bread!

Day and night the pilgrims were in the utmost ecstasy and
rapture, their spirits soaring to the Supreme Concourse, thoroughly
oblivious to worldly concerns and such mundane things as food.
Rich and poor were one and the same. All were profoundly devoted
to the Beloved and adored His heavenly, moon-brilliant
Countenance. Neither superiority nor inferiority existed among the
pilgrims. Rich or poor, we all sat at the same table, enjoyed the same
food and drank from the same chalice of love. “How magnificent is
that assemblage of love where the deprived sits equal to the king!”

To cheer the friends, His Holiness ‘Abdu’l-Bahá often came
and joined us in meals. After inspecting the kitchen and the situation
of the pilgrims, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would provide the necessary
instructions for improvements.

In addition to his services at the pilgrim house, which included
cooking meals and arranging the affairs of the pilgrims, the honored
Áqá Muhammad-Hasan greatly loved to engage in discussions and

discourse, and offering detailed opinions accompanied by historical
deductions. If anyone raised a question, he would provide a long
explanation that would thoroughly and completely explore all
aspects of the subject matter. He was truly learned, particularly in the
areas of mysticism, philosophy and proofs. He also had a deep
knowledge of the Faith’s history.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Utterances in the Pilgrim House of
‘Akká

Since I had not seen the friends all day, I decided
> to come to the pilgrim house and visit you. The weather
> was stormy, I had the lingering trace of an illness and,
> therefore, thought it best not to leave the house so that
> my condition would not worsen. This was in accordance
> with the command of Bahá’u’lláh, Who has enjoined
> upon us the observance of wisdom. Consequently, I
> rested. Under all circumstances, we must be prudent, as
> the Sacred Text has explicitly ordained wisdom upon us
all.

It was in accordance with this ordinance [of
> Bahá’u’lláh] that I sent Áqá Siyyid Asadu’lláh to Istanbul
> to remedy (the bite of the rabid dog) so that it would
> serve as an example to the friends. Whenever sickness
> prevails and health is disturbed, seek the counsel of a
> competent physician. Protection of one’s well-being and
> health is repeatedly enjoined in the Qur’án.84 However,
> the Muslims do not follow the laws of the Qur’án and
> are unaware that it states fate is of two kinds,
> irrevocable85 and alterable. It is revealed that one must
> guard against the alterable. Consider a lantern in which
84 For example, the Qur’án 2:191 states: “... throw not yourself with your own hands into
ruin.”
85 The original term is “hatami”, which implies being preordained.

> the owner has deposited fuel and wick sufficient for ten
> nights. If no interference occurs, it burns brightly for ten
> nights. But with the gust of a strong wind, it will be
> extinguished, which is why it is revealed that one must
guard against sudden gusts.86

Similarly, it is revealed, “The knowledge of bodies
> and the knowledge of religions.”87 Notice that the
> knowledge of the body is given preference over the
> knowledge of religion. Consider: A Christian has three
> children and exerts the utmost care in guarding their
> well-being and health. But a Muslim has twenty offspring
> and as he is careless in their affairs, they all roam the
streets, expire and die.

A cholera epidemic broke out in Tripoli, and since
> the Christians were vigilant, only two of them died;
> whereas two thousand Muslims perished due to their
lack of attention and safekeeping.

It was for this reason that I sent Áqá Siyyid
> Asadu’lláh so that none would speak critically. In truth,
> the root of wisdom is with God – He gave wisdom to
> the Prophets, and the physicians have inherited the same
> from Them.

86 The Gleanings, LXVIII, p. 133, states: “Know thou, O fruit of My Tree, that the decrees of
the Sovereign Ordainer, as related to fate and predestination, are of two kinds. Both are to be
obeyed and accepted. The one is irrevocable, the other is, as termed by men, impending. To the
former all must unreservedly submit, inasmuch as it is fixed and settled. God, however, is able to
alter or repeal it. As the harm that must result from such a change will be greater than if the decree
had remained unaltered, all, therefore, should willingly acquiesce in what God hath willed and
confidently abide by the same. The decree that is impending, however, is such that prayer and
entreaty can succeed in averting it.” Regarding “gusts” and predestination, the Qur’án 77
states, “By the (Winds) Sent Forth one after another (to man's profit); which then blow violently
in tempestuous Gusts, and scatter (things) far and wide; then separate them, one from another, then
spread abroad a Message, whether of Justification or of Warning – assuredly, what ye are promised
must come to pass.”
87 This is a well-known hadith, attributed to Prophet Muhammad. Bahá’u’lláh evokes

the same tradition; for example, see Tablet to Mírzá ‘Alí-Muhammad Ibn-Asdaq
quoted in ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd Ishráq-Khávarí’s Ganjinih Hudud va Ahkam, p. 244.

Unclad, Dark-skinned Arab
[‘Abdu’l-Bahá related the following story:]

One day in Baghdad, I went hunting with two or
> three of the friends. Riding a camel, an unclad Arab
> Bedouin came towards us. In jest, one of the friends
> raised his gun to scare the Arab, but another one
> prevented him. The Arab came, dismounted and asked
> for bread; we gave him some. He asked for tobacco and
> pipe, which we also gave. He asked for ammunition, and
> we provided it. But we had no coffee to give him.
Pleased with us, eventually he left.

<35> The friend who had prevented the mock
> shooting said, “Do not be deceived by the appearance of
> this unclad, skinny and dark-skinned Arab. He is the
> chief of a large tribe and commands many men. If
> anyone were to attack him, he would raise a cry, which
> would summon multitudes of supporters to his aid. A
> huge commotion would ensue, and his men would exact
severe revenge.”

Now, our condition is much the same as that dark
> Arab’s. Outwardly we seem naked and alone, with no
> support or champion, standing single and alone. But in
> reality, the invisible hosts of the Supreme Concourse are
> our aid, and whenever they see us attacked or threatened,
> They immediately rush forth to our assistance.

[Diffusion of the Faith]
Regarding the fact that each day the call of the Cause of God was
raised in yet a new location, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked one-day:

When He had returned to Baghdad, one day the
> Blessed Perfection was passing over a bridge and
> someone mentioned to His blessed Person that a letter
> was received from Mosul in which reference had been
> made to Bahá’u’lláh. With greatest excitement and joy,
> the Ancient Beauty cried out, “Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-
> Qulí, Áqá Mírzá Muhammad-Qulí88, come quickly and
88A younger brother of Bahá’u’lláh, he was raised by the Latter, shared all His exiles
and hardships, and most devotedly served Him throughout his life.

> hear the glad-tidings that the fame of the Cause has
> reached Mosul!”

Regarding Tihrán
[About Tihrán, and the effect of the Constitutional Revolt, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá noted:]

Tihrán is in great agitation. In truth, the late
> Muzaffaru’d-Din Sháh did all he could for his subjects.
> But it would have been better to have first educated the
> people of Iran, and then have given them liberty. It is
> like many well-fed and trained horses that have been
> raised on a ranch and then all of a sudden released and
set free. The result is chaos and disorder.

Now in Tihrán they are beating, killing and cursing
> each other. They desire civilization, and indeed civil
> society is a good thing: but it must depend on spiritual
> education. Otherwise, the outward evidences of
> civilization are the Krupp cannons, Henry Martin guns
and other destructive weapons. This is not civilization.

In former Ages, at a time when no such notion as
> civilization existed, when a king decided to wage war
> against another monarch, at most two or three thousand
> would be killed. But now that [material] civilization has
> appeared, each hour hundreds, nay, thousands perish [on
> the battlefield]. When divine civilization is established,
> then out of necessity, material civilization will follow as
well.

Ponder this: Amru’l-Qays had entrusted Samuel
> the Jew, who lived in the Island of Barlsham, with five
> bags of coins. The Isle’s ruler heard of this and
> surrounded Samuel’s fort, demanding the coins. Samuel
> refused on the grounds that they were a trust, and
> eventually the two sides came to blows, in the course of

> which a son of Samuel was killed. But the trust was not
> violated. At last, a son of Amru’l-Qays came, and the
> bags were returned to him. Now, in which European
> country can a similar civilization be found? Nevertheless,
> the Europeans consider these people as animals and
> barbarians, whereas today, in truth, in none of the [so-
> called] civilized countries of the world can a similar
civilization be seen.

My point is that the Bahá’ís of Iran live in peace
> because I have repeatedly written that they should not
> interfere in political matters. Praise be unto God that
> they never intervened and are now in safety. And if some
> did meddle in politics, then they alone suffered the
> consequences. Repeatedly and successively, I have
> written to the friends of God in Iran not to breathe a
> word about politics, even should they be slaughtered. I
> am well pleased with them and grateful that they have
not entered into politics.

Anyhow, such affairs are not our concern; ours is
to bring about spirituality and morality.

[On Satan]
The honored Akhavan-Safá inquired of the nature of Satan89 and
[‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s] response was:

Satan is the base self, which provokes destruction
> and impetuosity. Outwardly some individuals are refined
> and presentable, but in their essence they remain base.
> That is, externally they appear like others, but they
> harbor sordid intentions and designs.

89The Hebrew word “‘izazil” is used in the original. Izazil is equivalent to Lucifer, or
to Arabic Iblis; see Isaiah 14:12.

Izazil, however, is the name of a person.

Utterances for the Pilgrims of Jewish Descent
[Addressing the pilgrims of the Jewish descent, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
remarked:]

You must be thrilled that on such a Day you have
> come to the Holy Land. Truly, it is because of your
> sincere intentions and pure hearts that in this Day you
> have heard the divine call and have immediately
> recognized it. How great are the tribulations that you
> have sustained at the hands of the Romans and the
> Muslims and others, and yet you have persevered. At
> last, the promise of the Prophets regarding you has been
> fulfilled. Soon, when others accept the Faith, you will be
> the source of great pride, and many will claim that they
> too were of Jewish descent and speak of you with
> admiration and praise. You must be very, very happy
> that in the Day of the Manifestation you were not
> deprived, but indeed attained unto it and came before
> the Sacred Threshold, arrived at the Sacred Land of
> Palestine and enrolled under the banner of the Lord of
> Hosts. This is an explicit promise and clearly enunciated
> by the Divine Prophets. They have foretold that even
> outwardly, the Jews will come to the Holy Land and
> once more reclaim their ancient splendor. I am very
> pleased with you. You have gladdened the spirit of your
illustrious Ancestor, Abraham, in the Abhá Kingdom.

Be under the protection of the Blessed Beauty.
Marhabá, fi ámáni’lláh90.

On another occasion, He remarked:

90   Lit, Welcome, be under the protection of God.

No other spot in the world is as pleasant and
> vivifying as this realm, nor can any rival it in beauty and
> majesty. On this mountain (Carmel), the Prophets of
> Israel spent Their nights in prayer and supplication. Its
> soil has been blessed by the footsteps of the Prophets.
> Soon will the Jewish people return to the Holy Land, and
> even in outward appearance, they will be exalted. They
> will then be so glorified that they will be the object of
> the enemies’ envy. This is naught but a divine decree,
> and nothing can impede its fulfillment. The sovereignty
> of David and the splendor of Solomon will once more
> be manifested. This land will be the envy of the world. It
> will be the center of industry and sciences. ‘Akká and
> Haifa will be connected, and all this land will be fertile
> and developed.

He is God.
O God! In the Sacred Books and Scriptures, revealed
> through Thy Messengers, Thou didst give the Israelites the glad-
> tidings and promise that the Day would come when despondent
Jews would prosper, and this captive and abased people would be

> the Holy Land. From lands far away, they would come together in
> Zion;91 and the outcast would be glorified, the needy would become
> affluent, the unknown would gain renown and the forsaken would
become the beloved of the world.

Now praise be unto Thee that the Day of that promised

O Lord, make evident Thy promise and glorify the

and Thou art the Seer, the Hearer and the All-Knowing.

‘A ‘A.

Regarding the publisher of the Egyptian newspaper al-
Mú’ayyad
[‘Abdu’l-Bahá commented:]

91 In Qur’án 17:104 it is stated: “And We said unto the Children of Israel after him: Dwell
in the land; but when the promise of the Hereafter cometh to pass, We shall bring you as a crowd
gathered out of various nations.”

This man thinks that he is uprooting the Tree of
> the Cause and does not see that he is promoting the
> Divine Faith. The Ancient Beauty has stated,
> “Whosoever arises to harm us is indeed a teacher of the
> Cause of God.” This newspaperman writes, “Alas
> Muslims! With utmost audacity, these people [i.e.
> Bahá’ís] have built their mosque in Chicago and erected
> their Mashriqu’l-Adhkár in the mid-heart of America! Is
> there not a Muslim left, or has Islam been robbed of its
> courage to protest?” Because of his articles, so far, two
> individuals have embraced the Faith! Such attackers are
> the propagators of the Cause, and yet they do not know
> they can never hope to harm the Tree of the Cause.
> However, they can perpetrate what they wish upon My
person.

Shaykh Mahmúd, the Mufti of Egypt, has written a
> polemic [against the Faith] and therein has noted, “None
> can deny or doubt His (‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s) humility and
> spirituality.” I wanted to write him and say, “Yes, there is
> a denier; he is My own brother!” Consider how the
> banner of the Cause of God has been hoisted upon the
> apex of the world, and yet the honored Mírzá
> Muhammad-‘Alí wants to bring it down. Truly this is
> humorous! By God, besides Whom there is no god, they
> will never be able to harm the Cause in the least, but if

> Insha’lláh, they will devise the means for Me, too, to
> drink from the chalice of martyrdom. I will be very
> grateful if they do such a thing. This is My highest
aspiration.

At the time of the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh, as we

[General Exhortations]
On the occasion of the arrival of Áqá Mírzá Mihdí, son of Hájí
Hakím Hárún Hamadáni, who had come from Beirut, the latter
organized a feast in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who remarked:

Earlier I was speaking with Áqá Mírzá Mihdí, and I
> said to him: You must be very happy as you have a
> father who is a believer. If you had been a son to the
> most powerful monarch on earth, you would not have
> attained such an exalted station. This is because we see
> that the kings of the realm perish completely and
> without trace, but the believers in the Day of the <40>
> Manifestation live forever. For instance, now, nearly
> thirty-five hundred years have passed since the
> Manifestation of Moses, and I am presently proving the
> truth of His Cause. Yesterday, incidentally, I was writing
> to a philosopher who maintained that the Prophets are
> barriers to progress, and I proved his error. I wrote him
> about the truth of His Holiness Moses. Consider how
lofty is His sovereignty!

Conversely, consider the case of Pharaoh. There is
> no sign of him, no name of him, no trace of him. The
> little name that remains of him is because he was a
> contemporary of His Holiness Moses. Otherwise,

pharaohs were many.

Insha’lláh, Áqá Mírzá Mihdí will complete his
> studies, for I have much work for him. The friends of
> God are confirmed under all conditions if they do not
> merely busy themselves with their own concerns, seeking
> only wealth and position, saying, “I have become a
> doctor and must therefore lead an easy life, and do this
> or that.” They must have good intentions and consider
> themselves the servants of the world of humanity. They
> must endure hardship and seek comfort for others. If
> they succeed in attaining such an attitude, they will be
> confirmed, and divine assistance will surround them. No
> fruits whatsoever will be manifested from those who are
> educated in worldly things and remain unaware of
> spiritual matters. However, those among the believers
> who live in accordance with the divine teachings,

[‘Alíyu’lláhís]
Áqá Akhaván-Safá asked of the prominent figures of the

‘Alíyu’lláhí92 faction, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá commented:

We have nothing to do with the past. “What has

Yahyá in Cyprus
[Regarding Mírzá Yahyá Azal in Cyprus, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked:]

Repeatedly the illustrious American believers send
> missives, desiring to go to Iran and visit the native land
> of the Blessed Beauty. I reply, “Now is not the time as
> Iran is in turmoil and there is no security. Insha’lláh, you
will go later. It is amazing and most remarkable.”

Yahyá is in Cyprus and his son, Ridván-‘Alí93, has
joined a [Christian] church. His other son, Ahmad, has

92 ‘Alíyu’lláhís or ‘Alí Iláhís, is the name often incorrectly ascribed to a Sufi order
known as Ahl-i Haqq. The latter order traces its original to the tribes in Qara-
Quyunlu Empire in the 15th century and constitutes a loose network of groups, each
with their own set of beliefs. While the Twelver Shi‘í Imams are revered by them,
They are not central to their convictions. The ‘Alíyu’lláhís on the other hand
maintain the supremacy of ‘Alí and believe in certain other extremist and skewed
views. For details see, Moojan Momen, An Introduction to Shi‘i Islam, pp. 46-7 and
Hasan Balyuzi, Eminent Bahá’ís at the Time of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 314.
93 He is remembered for having devoted much time to transcribing Bábí writings,

particularly many manuscripts for Prof E.G. Browne. A number of Writings of the
Báb and other prominent figures of that Dispensation, such as Quddús, have
survived in the hands of Ridván-‘Alí.

evinces the utmost incompetence and ineptitude.”

Regardless, it is good to go and see for yourself.

[Service to the Cause]
In the course of our journey from Tihrán to ‘Akká, the Holy Land,
wherever we met the friends of God, they implored us to mention
their names in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s august presence. We had made a list
of these names and one day, the honored Mírzá Isháq [Haqíqí] and I
presented it [to the Master]. He commented, “You are always
present and observe how many letters I have penned for you.
Despite all the work that I have – of which you are well-aware – I
have written a very long Tablet, nay, a book.94 Send it to Tihrán so

94This long Tablet is printed in Makátib ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, volume 2, pages 105[-112].
(HM)

they can transcribe and send it to all communities. It is very
comprehensive. Insha’lláh, you will go and revive the world for the
body of mankind is dead.”

Mírzá Isháq Khan Haqíqí responded, “By the grace of God,
we will do so. Otherwise we have no such worth!” “Consider this
tree,” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “If it only focuses on its own merits,
then it will have no hope, and will be deprived. However, if its hope
is on the billowing waves of the sea of nature that send forth clouds,
rain, merciful breezes and nourishment, the tree will eventually grow
green and verdant, with leaves and blossoms. The sun will shine on
it, and it will bear fruits and bring forth goodly results. It is the same
as you have stated. If a person does not sense the same, remains
unaware of his shortcomings, and exerts no efforts to improve
himself, then he is no better than a stone. When a person is humble
and becomes selfless, then he grows hopeful [of divine assistance].
We, too, are confident of the bounties and confirmations of the
Blessed Beauty. Insha’lláh, you will also be fruitful and productive.
Be confident.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá then brought a bottle of pure attar [of rose] and
anointed our faces. “I wish to perfume your faces much the same as
in past ages, when people cleansed and perfumed themselves, so
that, God willing, you will be confirmed and successful and, through
consultation with the friends of God, will try to exert your utmost.”

Afterwards, He turned to me and said, “You have many
brothers and sisters there, and I wish to send a few of the Iranian
[Bahá’ís] to America. For now you may take your leave. Marhabá, fí
ámánu’lláh. Be under the protection of the Blessed Beauty!”

[Dr. and Mrs. Krug]
‘Abdu’l-Bahá had revealed a Tablet for someone in Canada.
(Apparently, this person was Mrs. Krug, wife of Dr. Krug. When
she embraced the Cause, her husband protested and disapproved of
the Bahá’ís frequenting his house or for the gatherings to be held
there. He was also unhappy that she was spending most of her time
in the service of the Cause and less on household matters or on him.
Eventually, their differences deepened and precipitated certain
difficulties about which she wrote to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and beseeched
His prayers so that either her devotion [to the Cause] would be
lessened, or her husband would be enabled to recognize the Faith
and no longer be in conflict with her. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá revealed a Tablet
and gave certain instructions, and eventually her husband embraced
the Cause and attained a distinguished station in the Faith.95

95Initially Dr. Florian Krug of New York was not a Bahá’í, but his wife, daughter
and son were. He met ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on His journey to the United States in 1912.
Eventually he became a Bahá’í and went on pilgrimage in late 1921. He was there
when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá passed away and since he was a physician, was summoned by the
family. Hasan Balyuzi, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: The Centre of the Covenant, p. 452, states that it

Because he ranked among the philosophers and the learned,
had mastered the natural sciences and was a man of liberal
proclivities with great influence and power, who initially disapproved
of his wife’s religious tendencies, whenever he conversed with his
friends after his conversion, he would remark, “The path we took
was not the path of righteousness, but we thought it was.”96 And
also, “We must seek the right path in the same way that it was
sought by the righteous and mend our own ways.”97)

On this occasion ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked:

Consider the majesty of the Word of God! This
> girl came here when she was engaged to an American
> who was a very learned and prominent scholar of that
> land. All spoke highly of him. When she came here, she
> grew very spiritual. She wrote Me a letter stating that she
> deeply loved him, but asked that I pray so that this love
> would end; for he was not a Bahá’í, and in no wise did
> she wish to marry a non-Bahá’í. The parents of the
> fiancée also wrote Me. Firmly, I wrote her that she must
> show affection to her husband. That is, I said, she was
> most definitely to marry him. Eventually, they married
> and afterwards he embraced the Faith. Now both reside
> in Canada and are engaged in service to the Cause.

was he who closed ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s eyes. There is also a short biography of Dr. Krug
in Marzieh Gail, Arches of the Years, starting page 106.
96 The statement could be a reference to the following verse of the Bible (Romans

10:3): “For they being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and going about to establish
their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of
God.”
97 It seems the following verse of the Bible (Isaiah 55:6-7) is being echoed: “Seek ye

the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near; Let the wicked
forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the
Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly
pardon.”

Lunch in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s House
All the pilgrims and a large number of the resident believers were at
the house of the Master for lunch and benefiting from His
utterances. A pitcher of warm water had been placed on the table
from which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá poured so that the guests could wash both
hands with soap. Standing next to the Master was Shoghi Effendi
who would hand each guest a clean, white towel. Some of the
friends were clever and also washed their face with the warm water
and soap.

With Shoghi Effendi on his way to England

After we sat around the table, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá served food for
everyone, looked after their needs, and commented:

Praise be unto God that through the generosity
> and benevolence of the Blessed Beauty, we have come to
> this resplendent spot and are assembled under the
> canopy of Bahá’u’lláh’s bounties. Such gatherings are
> held solely through divine grace and favor, and,
> therefore, we must be thankful for them. With deep
> devotion and longing, each of us has come from some
distant land and has no purpose except the good

pleasure of God. It is a feast of love and fellowship.

The believers must be servants to the world of
> humanity. They must be kind to one another, nay
> sacrifice themselves for others. They must not just love
> their friends but should also be kind to their enemies and
> indeed count them as friends. Since these people have
> not drunk from the chalice of divine love, they know not
> [such sentiments]. But since you have been raised under
> the shadow of the bounties of the Ancient Beauty, <45>
> you must befriend all the peoples of the world. You
> must be a true servant to each member of humanity, not
> just by your words, but, verily, by your conduct and from
> the depth of your soul, heart and belief. You should do
> so not because people may recognize your good deeds,
> but because the Blessed Beauty has wished it and it
> meets His good-pleasure.

[Duty of Bahá’ís]
On the occasion of the departure [for Iran] of Mírzá Isháq Khan
Haqíqí, Áqá Mírzá Mihdí Akhaván-Safá and Mírzá Habíbu’lláh
Samímí, [‘Abdu’l-Bahá said]:

The spirit of the world is dead. Each of you, in
> accordance with your own capacity, must arise in service
> and sacrifice. Insha’lláh, with utmost joy and well-being,
> rejuvenated and renewed, and by the life-giving Most
> Great Spirit, in felicity you will return to serve the Cause
> of God. God willing, you will be confirmed and
> successful. Tell the friends of God in Iran that, at
> present, the government and the people have arisen to
> destroy one another. Now is your time: Arise and win
> the prize of everlasting happiness! You must guide the
> people. Each Bahá’í must teach at least one soul each
> year. Each believer can revive another soul during the

> year, even through praise and prayers. And if a greater
> number is taught, so much the better. However, at least
one person must be taught by each Bahá’í [every year].

Each night that I cannot sleep, I implore and
> beseech the Sacred Threshold of the Blessed Beauty with
> utmost intensity and fervor to confirm His divine friends
> under all conditions. Of a certainty, He will do so. If it
> had not been for My supplications, no trace could be
> found of My bones or those of the friends. Therefore,
> with fervent supplication, the friends must ask for
> whatever they desire from the Threshold of the Ancient
Beauty.

When you go to ‘Iraq, convey my earnest greetings
> to each and every one of the divine friends and tell them
> that I was greatly perturbed and saddened by their
> differences. Praise be unto God that the news of their
> unity and peace was received and brought much joy to
> My heart. At the beginning, I was so grieved that I
> terminated My correspondence with them, but now I am
very pleased and joyful with them.

In truth, if, God forbid, the slightest dust of
> disagreement clouds the relationship between two of the
> friends, others must quickly arise and do their utmost to
> settle the dispute and reestablish love and unity. Even if
> one or two days pass with an unresolved difference, it
> will become firmly rooted and animosity will develop.
> The friends of God must be peacemakers and in matters
> of common good, promote the general well-being. They
> must consider Bahá’ís and nonbelievers as one and the
> same. We have been created for the betterment of all
> people and nothing else!

When these friends were departing, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
affectionately embraced each and said, “The same way that I have
embraced and kissed you, you must embrace and kiss each and every

one of the friends of God that you meet. Fí ámánu’lláh. Marhabá!”

After their departure, He noted, “Saying farewell is a bad
thing, but what can we do? It is a tradition. It would be good to
remove it from our ways because it brings sadness.”

[Husayn Sádiqí]
The story of the honored Husayn Sádiqí is very interesting and
worth telling. I first met him in Haifa’s Rahmání pilgrim house.98
During the First World War, 1914-18, I returned to Iran and, on a
postal card, received a Tablet which contained the news of [the
imminent] arrival of Husayn Sádiqí. I waited for some time, but
there was no sign or news of Sádiqí. Eventually in 1919, when Iran
was embroiled in total turmoil, discord and disorder ruled the land
and murder and chaos were at their height, one day I saw a very
unkempt man with tribal headwear approaching me. I recognized
him to be the long-expected Husayn Sádiqí, who had been in the
Ottoman military and who had crossed the border of Iran, walked to
Kirmánsháh and had now found me.

Since he was a soldier and a guard in the Ottoman army, he
preferred sleeping during days and staying awake at nights, guarding
our residence. I took advantage of his availability and gave him a
gun, and all night he would pace the courtyard and protect us, while
we slept at ease. At that time, midnight thieves would often attack
homes and rob them of everything. It seemed that this heavenly
guard was sent to me by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for my protection and safety.
After a few months with me, he left to teach the Cause in the
surrounding regions, and wherever he went, he left behind
unforgettable memories. The mercy of God rest upon his departed
soul.

It is befitting to quote at this juncture a Tablet sent to
Baghdad and revealed in honor of Husayn Sádiqí, son of Mírzá

The pilgrim house of Haifa was built by Mírzá Ja‘far Rahmání of Shiraz, known as

\[98\] 
Hádíoff, and in the early days was known by his name.

Músá Harf Baqá [the letter of eternity], which speaks about the
differences among the believers of that region. The original of this
Tablet I have sent to the [International] Archives on Mount Carmel.

He is the All-Glorious!
O ye eager souls trembling with the breezes of the love of
> God wafting from the meads of the Kingdom of the All-Glorious
> One! I swear by the one True God! Verily the Sacred Concourse,
> those essences of certitude in the divine unity, those temples of God’s
> singleness, all yearn for you, especially this pitiful servant, a
> stranger in this land, humble, broken, and lowly. I beseech God
> that “He may dispose of our affairs in the right way,”99 and that
> He might ordain for me the joy of beholding the faces of the loved
> ones of God and associating with those dawning places of light in
> the assemblage of faithfulness. O my Lord! Grant me this bounty,
> inebriate me with this mystic wine and illumine mine eyes with the
> light shining from the faces of Thy righteous loved ones. Verily
Thou art the Most Bountiful, the Giver, the All-Merciful.

Praise be unto God, the Provider of Divine Bounty and
> Nourishment, He Who is the Inscriber of the Point from which the

> the apex of the heavens, He Who casteth forth meteors dispersing

> in the globes of faithfulness, making them to be stars of His Abhá
> Kingdom. Salutations, glory, and praise be upon those holy souls
> who have humbled themselves, prostrated, and brought themselves
> low before the dust trodden by the footsteps of the beloved ones of
God.

O ye chosen ones of God! It is incumbent on you to attain
> unity and concord and at all times to eschew dissension and
> estrangement, and to avoid hypocrisy. Be as one single cord,
> heavenly and united, and as the arrayed hosts of the concourse on

> amidst all the communities, tribes and sections of humankind, that
> He may send forth to you victory and success from the Realm of
> Abhá, and support you with the spiritually marshaled and engaged
armies and regiments of the Sublime Concourse.

But if ye be divided and be afflicted with dissension, grace
> and bounty will vanish from your midst, the floods of divine
> generosity will be impeded, your Heavenly Beloved will show His
> wrath towards you, your portion of divine grace will diminish, and
> the Divinely ordained Physician will flee your company, your
> adversaries will defeat you, and they that hate you will achieve
> domination over you, your assemblage will disperse, your company
> will fragment, your lights will be darkness, your scintillating star
> will set, and your gathering will be scattered, your flowing water
> will completely ebb away, the fire of your spiritual torment will
> blaze deep, and you will become as bodies without spirit, as cups
> bereft of mystic wine, a bulb of glass without a light, lost in your
ways, without any means of ascent.

I supplicate God, however, that He may open unto you the
> portals of unity under all conditions, sanctified from all limitations
> and imitations, that at all times ye may cling to the hem of
> singleness and detachment. I swear by the righteousness of God that
> the heart of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá will never be joyous but in the unity of
> the friends, and love among the chosen ones of God. I beg God that
He may vouchsafe this joyous bounty unto me.

Áqá [Muhammad-]Ridá Qannád101

Translation by Dr. Khazeh Fananapazir.

\[100\] 101Originally of Shiráz, Áqá Muhammad-Ridá had a confectioner’s shop in
Baghdad, which earned him the title of Qannád. When Bahá’u’lláh left Baghdad,
Muhammad-Ridá accompanied Him to ‘Akká. After the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh, he
continued to serve ‘Abdu’l-Bahá until his passing in about 1912. His son, Mírzá
Habíbu’lláh, was a secretary of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá during the first phase of His ministry

The late Áqá Ridá Qannád Shirází was a sincere and devoted
servant. Though he was very old and broken, day and night he
served with utmost diligence and obeyed the wishes of the Master
with all his heart. In truth, whenever he was sent [by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
on an errand, he would run the whole way, much like someone who
was being chased. Most of the external affairs of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
household and transmission of messages were conducted through
him. He had a particular affinity for reading newspapers, and when
Iranian newspapers subscribed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá arrived in ‘Akká, he
would read the whole thing and, in a few words, report the contents
to the Master.

This day, like other days, he gained admittance to the presence
[of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] and reported on the news of Iran, the
Constitutional Revolt and the present government.102 [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
We desire neither absolute despotism, nor

and a strong defender of the Covenant. Later he sought service in the diplomatic
field and became the Iranian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia and Yemen. His son,
Amír-‘Abbás Huvaiyda, served as the Prime Minister of Muhammad-Reza Sháh
Pahlaví for some 15 years, while he always insisted on his Muslim identity..
102 On history of the Constitutional Revolt in Iran see E.G. Browne, The Persian

Revolution 1905-1909, Janet Afary, The Iranian Constitutional Revolution 1906-1911, and

Mírzá Mihdí, Son of Hakím Hárúm
After the departure of Mírzá Mihdí, (who was a student of medicine

in the French University in Beirut,) son of Hakím Hárún, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá said, “When he left, he was very happy, better than when he
came. It is certain that divine exhortations are like the spring breeze,
which generates joy and longing, and rejuvenates the soul. However,
the discourse of others is like the fall’s blast, causing sadness and
weariness. Praise be unto God that the divine breeze wafted over
him and gave him joy and felicity. Surely it will have an effect.”

Situation in Iran
[‘Abdu’l-Bahá said,] “Presently, Iran is in turmoil, but it will be
better later. Consider: First the wind blows, then the sky becomes
cloudy which causes rain, hail and snow to descend, which in turn
results in the ground being covered with ice and sleet. But then the
springtime emerges. We too are hopeful that after these turbulences,
the veils will be lifted and we will witness the emergence of the life-
giving spring.”

In the midst of His utterances, the Iranian Consul came in and
after the exchange of pleasantries, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá commented, “Yes,
about four months ago I wrote that until the government and the
people are mixed like milk and honey, <50> the desired benefit
would not be realized. Did you see with what vulgarity and
impudence the Rúh-i Nahs103 (Rúhu’l-Quds Newspaper is intended)
has loosened its tongue to criticize the king?104 When they try to

103Lit, the ill-omened spirit.
104 Rúhu’l-Quds or Rúhu’l-Qudus [the Holy Spirit] was the name of a newspaper
printed in Tihrán under the editorship of the Sultánu’l-‘Ulamá of Khurásán. It
printed a total of 26 issues from 5 August 1907 to 20 May 1908. This newspaper
achieved special notoriety due to its extraordinary boldness, and published in its 13th
issue a personal attack on Muhammad-‘Alí Sháh and his anti-constitutional actions,
threatening him with the fate of Louis XVI, King of France, and recalling the
French Revolution. In consequence of this article it was suppressed, but after a
while resumed publication. E.G. Browne in his The Press and Poetry of Modern Persia,
pp. 87-88, notes: “The editor of this newspaper was a man of extraordinary
conviction and zeal, and took a personal share in the National efforts to defend the
Constitution. Thus he participated vi et armis in the struggle between the Nationalists

force and pressure the monarch into concessions then how can they
hope for royal bounties and support? Praise be to God that Bahá’ís
are completely uninvolved in these affairs and are safe. These
revolutions are for the enemies of the Cause. They do not realize
that they are paving the way.”

Subsequently the Master instructed Mírzá Muhsin Afnán,
“Take the Hamadání pilgrims (of Jewish descent) to meet the
American pilgrims, Mrs. Cooper and Mrs. Goodall.”

Shortly before dusk, we collectively went to visit the
Americans, and after the usual exchange of pleasantries, they asked
the Bahá’ís of Jewish descent, “How did you come to be Bahá’ís?
Did you first become Christian, then Muslim and then Bahá’í, or
was it in some other manner? Please do tell.” “We were first
Jewish,” was our response, “and unwilling to even hear the names of
Christ and Muhammad, much less declare the truth of Their
missions. However, once we became Bahá’ís, then we attained the
shores of certitude regarding Them as well. Therefore, our belief in
Them is through the teachings of His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh, which
has rent asunder the veils before us and has given sight to our blind
eyes so we can discern the truth of Their claim.”

The American Pilgrims and the Feast at the Master’s
House
[In a feast held in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s house, He remarked:]

This feast belongs to the illustrious pilgrims of
> Jewish descent. Through the favors of the Blessed
> Beauty, many diverse people have gathered in this

and the troops of Muhammad-‘Alí Sháh on the occasion of the Reactionary Coup
d’Etat of 23 June 1908, and fought valorously in defense of the Majlis [parliament].
Finally he was taken prisoner, was confined in chains in the Bágh-i-Sháh, and
ultimately suffered a martyr’s death, and was thrown into a well. The politics of the
paper were Revolutionary.” The text of the issue 13, alluded to by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
appears in Browne’s Persian Constitutional Revolution, pp. 156-161.

One of the Renowned ‘Ulamá of Khurásán has Died
The honored Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí remarked that one of the
renowned ‘ulamá of Khurásán had passed away. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked,
“In what way do they acquire learning and become recognized as
scholars? By study of jurisprudence and scripture?” “By offering
obligatory prayers,” the Hájí responded, “Whoever among them
observes this law more frequently, he is more learned than the rest.”
These people study for fifty years to learn the signs

Tea must be Good in Every Way
I took tea into the blessed presence [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá], two serving
pots on a clean tray. In one pot was tea, in another was boiling
water. There were also two cups, one filled with hot water and the
other empty and covered with a white cover. Next to these was a
small crystal bowl of sugar lumps. He said, “This is very good. Tea
must be like this: good sugar, excellent tea, purified water, clean cup
and in every way neat and organized. Otherwise, it is better not to
drink it. ‘What is not cared for at the beginning cannot be remedied
at the end.’”

He continued: “The Egyptian chiefs want to become Wahhábí
and promote Wahhábí convictions. Perchance they hope to resist

105   Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-i Íqán, p. 146

European expansion through wars, violence, confrontations and
slaughter. However, they are increasingly powerless and ineffective.
They use this as a distraction. ‘A drowning man will cling to
anything.’ But it will bear no result, none whatsoever, since its
foundation is infirm and not based on divine teachings. These very
designs will cause their own division and demise. They must first
understand what brought about the progress of Islam and then
follow suit. Their goals will not be achieved through political
methods or nationalistic sentiments, especially when they are
imitating others. The initiator is of course superior to the imitator.
‘And they who were foremost on earth – are the foremost still.
These are they who shall be brought nigh to God.’106 ‘And God will
never forget the one who has rendered victorious His cause. There is
no demise for him, and the converse holds as well. These people will
not become righteous at the end unless they become righteous at the
beginning.’”

[The Situation in Russia]
Addressing the honored Áqá Ridá Qannád, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá inquired,
“What news do you have?” He described whatever he had read in
the newspapers about the turmoil in Russia, the killings of the Jews
and the imprisonment of people from the Duma. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
replied:

After these occurrences, it will be better. There was

108 The woman who wrote about the Báb and Tahirih was Izabella Grinevskaya: 1) A

Tragedy Named “Bab” and, 2) a poem named “Bahá'u'lláh”. Her drama on the Báb
was published in May 1903 and was played in St. Petersburg in January 1904. It was
this drama that brought Leo Tolstoy a knowledge of the Bahá’í teachings. After

‘Akká’s Fleas

three decades from these dates Martha Root researched this subject thoroughly and
wrote about it in several publications. For a short introduction by Martha Root see

111 These fleas are renowned and until a person has experienced them, one finds it

hard to believe how terribly plentiful and bothersome they are. I remember that
once I walked into a room and immediately my two feet were covered by them to
near my knees, much like wearing a pair of black socks. (HM)

[Consecration to the Cause]
Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí remarked, “My Master, I have found the
Tablet addressed to Mírzá Yúsuf Khán.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá replied:

112   Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-i Aqdas, K53

Charity to the Poor113
Once or twice a week, the poor received their allotment, which was
distributed by His blessed hand. Most of them were disabled and
would encircle the Master’s house in a single row. When all had
assembled, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would emerge and with His own hand give
to each as he deserved. Some would receive the alms, but then they
would circle the line and stand at the end so that they might receive
an additional share. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá called each by name, and when
someone tried to get money a second time, He would say, “I have
already given you some, but come and get some more.”

This time, the school children and the poor came and ‘Abdu’l-

113 These were professional beggars who regularly received governmental welfare
and also alms from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. However each dawn, the Master would visit the
homes of those that were truly destitute and give them whatever sum they needed.
Each day, He visited a different street. In addition, every year, he distributed two or
three hundred sets of clothing, several ‘abás, and other provisions and gave each
needy person what he required. The entire city of ‘Akká, whether rich or poor,
Jewish, Christian or Muslim, was a recipient of special bounties of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and
each received His generous care and compassion. (HM)

Bahá said, “Give Me some money so I can distribute it among them
and enjoy so doing.” He went and distributed the alms among the
needy.

[Various Notes]
Each Friday morning, Bahá’í children attained the presence of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá and presented their weekly studies and exercises. He
reviewed and corrected most and gave each student a prize. The
children did their work in nasta‘líq calligraphy, taught by Mishkín-
Qalam and, because of him, all Bahá’í students had exquisite
handwriting. This pattern in the Holy Land is now the model for all
Bahá’í children’s classes.

Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí inquired, “Áqá Siyyid Nasru’lláh
Baqiroff has asked if Doctor Mírzá Muhammad Khán [Mahallatí]
should stay with Áqá Siyyid Asadu’lláh [in Constantinople], or if he
should return.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded:

Why would he not stay? He has a merry time and
> in addition will complete his studies. However, he may
> not have sufficient funds, for when he left here, he
> stated that he had the necessary money for only four
> months of living. But when a person is confident and
> assured of divine confirmations, then the entire earth
and heaven will serve him.

About that time the Qádí of ‘Akká and some other non-
Bahá’ís entered and went directly upstairs to the second floor of the
Master’s residence. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to us, “The friends must
excuse me. If I delay meeting these visitors, they will be annoyed.
Forgive me.” With that, He left.

The Shrine of the Báb – Mount Carmel
The following comments of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá are recorded [in Arabic] in
the diary of Dr. Zia Baghdadi:

Consider the foolishness of the governments of
> Iran and the Ottoman Empire, how they banished
> Bahá’u’lláh from Iran to Baghdad and Constantinople,
> and from there exiled Him to ‘Akká. They perpetrated
> this deed in the hopes of destroying the foundation of

there is no other course left for them.

However, regarding the future of Carmel, I now

However others are not endowed with this insight.

On another occasion, when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was strolling in the
garden115, He paused and for awhile looked out to the sea at ‘Akká,
and after a few minutes of silence, said:

> I have seen many places, but none has the vivifying air

He then said to Áqá Rahmatu’lláh Khádim, “Send two or
three of the squashes you have planted to the house so they can
make Me a broth with them.” He left afterwards.

Chapter 3

Years of Study in Beirut

I completed the last year of high school and received my diploma. I
then spent the spring of 1908 in Beirut and that summer in ‘Alíyyih
in Lebanon with Mírzá Ridá Khán Tahmasb who [years] later in
Tabríz received the title of Shamsu’l-Atibbá [The sun of physicians].
He was a nephew of Najif Áqá, one of the chiefs of the ‘Alíyu’lláhí
[Sufi] order, and was my roommate and classmate. He was a
wonderful and upright youth, and we spent two or three years
together. Most of the time, he would associate with Protestants and
had developed inclinations towards Christianity. When he met the
believers, saw their ways and attitudes, and heard them speak of the
Faith, he was enchanted by the Cause and would speak of it in
meetings of the Protestants.

[The Brilliant Proof]
One day117 Mírzá Ridá Khán came to me and had brought along a
repudiatory pamphlet written by [Reverend] Peter Z. Easton, one of
the Protestant Missionaries in Tabríz. He said, “The Protestants
gave me this pamphlet.”118

I took it to the esteemed Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl and explained the
situation to him, briefly outlining the content of the pamphlet.
Residing in a hostel, the honored Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl was ill and bed-
ridden, but immediately rose, placed his ‘abá over his shoulders, and
instructed me to take pen and paper to take down dictation of his

117 This incident must have taken place on 27 December 1911 and seems to be
reported by Dr. Mú’ayyad out of chronological sequence.
118 This essay was published in Evangelical Christendom. Easton’s attack followed a

meeting between him and the Master in September 1911 in London. For details see
Hasan Balyuzi, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, pp. 149-151.

rebuttal. For about one hour he dictated, and I wrote. It was not
finished, but he grew very tired and had to return to bed, saying, “Fi
ámánu’lláh. You go now and when I feel better, I will finish
composing the reply.”

The following day, I went to the hostel [to visit Mírzá Abú’l-
Fadl] and he informed me, “I have completed the reply to Peter Z.
Easton. Submit it by post to the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to do
with it as He deems appropriate.” <60> I mailed the treatise to the
United States and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá instructed that both the Persian and
the English translation be published in the United States. He titled
this document Burhán-i-Lámi‘ [The Brilliant Proof] and today is a
well-known treatise among the friends.119

[Medical School]
Once more the academic year commenced [in Fall 1908], and I
started as a freshman in the [Syrian Protestant] College. At the
completion of the year and the beginning of the summer [1909], I
went again to ‘Alíyyih in Lebanon and spent that season in ‘Aynu’s-
Siyyidih, a very pleasant village located between ‘Alíyyih and Súqu’l-
Gharb. This village has a vivifying air and most agreeable
atmosphere.

After my sophomore year, I spent the summer [1910] in the
company of Dr. Yúnis Khán Afrukhtih and Badí‘ Effendi Bushrú’í
(a very bright young man whose studies were being financially
supported by Miss Barney. She later became known as Madam
Dreyfus and published Kitáb-i Mufávidát [Some Answered Questions
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]). We went to Haifa and spent the summer [of
1910] on Mount Carmel, under the shadow of the Shrine of the Báb.

119   First published in 1912 by Chicago’s Bahá’í News Service.

Haifa’s City Hall, 1910

Occasionally, we would go to ‘Akká, and at times, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá would come to visit the Shrine of the Báb. It so happened that
one time when He came, I was sick and in bed.120 He visited me and
offered me the remaining grapes that He was eating. I ate the grapes
and a few hours later regained my perfect health! That illness was a
thousand times sweeter than any state of well-being, and for the rest
of my life, I will never forget their wonderful taste. What other fever
brought such unceasing rapture and what other illness caused such
perpetual joy and happiness! I have always wished for its recurrence,
and many a night have I dreamt of its delights, that perchance it
would revisit me and reunite me once more with my Beloved!

Shouldst Thou come by my bed as healer,

For its delight I would not barter both worlds.

But, alas, “take ye joy in the beauty of the narcissus of Najd,
for night will fall and it will be no more.”121 Never again will I
behold that experience, nor attain unto that longing [to see ‘Abdu’l-

120 I had a fever for several days and those who were around me later said that it was
very severe. (HM)

Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 258.

Bahá].

When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá visited the Shrine of the Báb, He always
spoke of the sufferings and hardships sustained by the Blessed
Perfection and the martyrdom of His Holiness the Exalted One [i.e.
the Báb]. He praised the invigorating air of Carmel and emphasized
how richly the divine favors had surrounded these unworthy
servants and how we stood under the shadow of the beneficence of
His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb]! He would say:

Attaining unto this Mountain was the ultimate
> desire of the Prophets, and it is the point of adoration of
> the Supreme Concourse. All the past Manifestations

> Dispensation, and their highest aspiration was to witness

> Peace will be hoisted and the foundation of the
> wondrous Divine Order will be established. All this land
will be built and developed.

After two thousand years of wandering, the Jewish

The First Two Years of Medical School in Beirut
With hardship and hard work, I completed the first year of medical
school, and during this time rendered some services to the Cause

not worthy of mention.122 Whatever the Holy Family requested, or
the pilgrims to the Holy Land required, or other students in Beirut
needed, I would gladly attend to and carry out. I would also
disseminate to the surrounding communities whatever Tablets and
correspondence were received from the Holy Land and dispatch the
friends’ missives, including the letters and writings of the illustrious
[Mírzá] Abú’l-Fadl.123 To the extent of my abilities, I saw to the
comfort of the pilgrims by securing their visas or passports,
purchasing their travel tickets and guiding visitors.124 Fortunately,
these insignificant gifts were accepted by the pilgrims, and for that, I
always thank God’s favors.

The second year of my medical studies was filled with
difficulties. First, I was required to pass the mid-studies examination
by the medical faculty in addition to another test administered by an
examining board of the Ottoman government, which came from
Constantinople. Second, since there was a delay in the arrival of my
stipend, my [financial] situation was growing critical, and I did not
even have the twenty-five liras needed for the examination fee.
Third, because of my immense workload, I became very ill, requiring
hospitalization and medical attention.

During my hours of solitude, I supplicated ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in my
heart and fervently besought His assistance. With tearful eyes and
soul on fire, I would compose supplications and submit them unto
His august and sanctified presence. Indeed, it was a strange year.

122 Khátirát Habíb, vol. 2, p. 36, notes that during this period the diarist was
associated with such believers as, Áqá Muhammad-Mustafá Baghdádí, Dr. Berkat,
Anton Haddád and ‘Ináyatu’lláh Cháí-Chí.
123 Several Bahá’í communities in the Near East served as conduit for

communication between ‘Akká/Haifa and Bahá’í communities of Iran. On general
migration patters of Iranian Bahá’ís see, Moojan Momen, “The Bahá’í Community
of Iran: Patterns of Exile and Problems of Communication” in Asghar Fathi, ed.
Iranian Refugees and Exiles Since Khomeini; (Costa Masa, CA: Mazda Publishers, 1991)
pp. 21-36.
124 Khátirát Habíb, vol. 2, p. 36, notes that with the departure of Áqá Muhammad-

Mustafá Baghdádí for Alexandretta, the diarist became responsible for seeing to the
needs of pilgrims and resident believers.

From every direction, troubles and difficulties beset me and I was
overwhelmed by their stress and gravity. Every time a letter arrived
from my father, it was filled with grievous and most unhappy tidings
and lamentations. He informed me of the plunder of our house by
the Sáláru’d-Dawlih and many other troubles that unceasingly
surrounded them. My nerves were fatigued, my body weak, and my
spirit depressed. All strength was drained from my being.

Below is a section that I recall from a poetic-missive that I
composed at that time, which to some degree conveyed the intensity
of the tribulations and the fire of misery, pain, depression and
paralysis that had engulfed me, and yet I had to advance my studies
and continue with life’s struggles:

O Hadrat-i ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,

O Center of the Covenant of Bahá,
O builder of the House of God,

Hold Thou my hand, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, have mercy on me,

Sacrifice my life for Thee,
Sacrifice it for Thy locks,

Hold Thou my hand, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Thou art aware,

Thou art life-taker and life-giver,
Thou art the guide of every wayward,

Hold Thou my hand, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, I am wretched,

I have no hope and am lost,
Like a babe in the cradle,

Hold Thou my hand, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
O Jehovah, resplendent Lord,

Have mercy on this ill one,
O promise of the tribe of Abraham,

Hold Thou my hand, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.125

125   ‘Ali Nakhjavani is thanked for the rendering of this poem.

In response to my supplication, a Tablet was revealed that was
the cure of all my ills. All my sorrow and melancholy vanished
completely. I forgot every pain that had ever afflicted me and with
new vigor and infinite enthusiasm resumed my studies and activities.
A few days later, yet another Tablet was received that redoubled my
joy and brought me an even larger measure of delight and felicity. I
quote both Tablets:

O thou who art firm in the Covenant! Thy letter arrived. A
> brief reply will be written, as there is no time. Do not be saddened
> by the occurrences in Kirmánsháh. God willing, thy health will
> return. I hope that thou remain protected in the face of trials.

And in the second Tablet it was revealed, exalted is His
station:

O thou who art firm in the Testament! Thy mellifluous
> poems were most sweet, endowed with eloquent and fluent
> expressions. Talent is like unto a spring: from some will flow sweet
> streams, while from others naught save bitter, salty water is tasted.
> Praise be unto God that from the gifted faculty of that friend who
> stands steadfast in the Covenant such clear water issues forth. You
> must give thanks that thy talent billows forth and thy spirit is
confirmed by the grace of the Almighty.

However, thou must employ this pure water in praise of our
> loving Lord, the Ancient Beauty and the Greatest Name [i.e.
> Bahá’u’lláh] – may My spirit be a sacrifice unto His friends.
> You must sing His laudation since ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is but a drop,
> but the Greatest Name is the mighty Ocean. When you have
praised the ocean, it will also encompass the drop.

Convey my warmest greetings to the friends of God. Upon
thee rest the Glory of God, the Most Glorious.

‘A ‘A.

It was not long thereafter that my versed-missive became an
anthem of the [Bahá’í] students in the [Syrian] College and was often
sung in the gatherings, which brought great excitement and joy to
all. The honored Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí, that love-intoxicated elder
believer, would be filled with delight by hearing this chant.

Since during this time ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was on a journey to Egypt,
Europe and America, Beirut had become an important center for
the Cause. Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl, that ocean of knowledge and sincerity,
was in Beirut, and Bahá’í travelers always frequented the city.
Despite the lack of funds, whatever was needed would be arranged.
I would convey ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s telegraphs and Tablets to the
illustrious Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl. Some of my time was devoted to my
studies and the rest to the service of the Faith, even during the hours
of leisure. Indeed the conditions of Beirut and the activities of the
friends attracted the repeated attention and the infinite bounties of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who sent many Tablets in honor of the students who
regularly kept coming there.

In a blessed Tablet received in honor of another student in
Beirut, Áqá ‘Abbás Khán, son of Sa‘ídu’l-Mulk Rashtí, known as
Akbar, the following was revealed:

O honored Áqá Mírzá Habíbu’lláh! The son of the
> illustrious Sa‘ídu’l-Mulk is in Beirut, and you must make every
> effort to ensure his well-being. Of course, from the outpouring of
> celestial favors, all the trees of the Abhá paradise in Beirut are
verdant and flourishing splendidly.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‘Abbás.

It was in the summertime [1911] that the illustrious Dihqán
family came to Beirut, while I was in the mountains of Lebanon.
The honored Mírzá Muhammad-Báqir Khán Dihqán126 arranged for
his children to remain in the mountains of Lebanon and he took me
126 A prominent Bahá’í of Shiraz and an important governmental official of Fárs;
see, Ahang Rabbani, In the Land of Refuge.

to Damascus and ‘Albak for a few days of sightseeing. We
subsequently returned to Lebanon.

<65> The Illustrious Abú’l-Fadl in Beirut
The number of students and visitors in Beirut had grown
considerably when the illustrious [Mírzá] Abú’l-Fadl arrived to settle
here. At first he rented a very modest house, but later moved to a
hostel. During that period, the number of visitors was increasing
each day, and many groups of friends visited in wave after wave.
Whoever had heard that the esteemed Abú’l-Fadl was in Beirut
eagerly came to benefit from seeing him. With a bent back and
trembling hands, this learned and renowned philosopher would
receive them and provide hospitality. He insisted on doing all the
work himself and never allowed anyone to help. For instance, when
guests visited him, he would go and fetch the water, place the kettle
on the kerosene-burner, wash the cups, dry them with a silk
handkerchief, place a lump of sugar in each and personally serve
each person. When we implored him to at least allow us to serve tea,
he would not consent to it and would devote two or three hours of
time to this task. He never permitted anyone to serve him, and in
fact, always insisted on serving others. We repeatedly entreated and
beseeched him for permission to do his regular shopping or attend
to his other needs, but even this he would refuse. With the utmost
fervor we would beg him, “Your time is so precious and must not
be wasted on mundane household chores. It is best if you spend
these hours writing for the Cause, even if it is only a short piece.”
Yet he was insistent in his refusal.

We reported the situation to the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
thinking that perchance He would instruct Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl to
accept the services of an attendant. He instead commanded,
“Absolutely do not disturb him, or interfere in his affairs. Leave him
to do as he pleases, as he is thus inclined.” Even in a blessed Tablet
addressed to this servant:

Find a residence in Beirut for the illustrious Abú’l-Fadl in
> an upper apartment that receives adequate sunlight and air. None
> is permitted to interfere in his affairs.

Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl’s conversion is among the most astounding
teaching stories of all time and was precipitated by Karbalá’í Husayn
Na‘lband [the farrier], who was an unlettered and ordinary man. The
late Ustád Husayn, otherwise known as Karbalá’í Husayn, had a
humble [black-smith] shop near the entrance of [the shrine of Sháh]
‘Abdu’l-‘Azím, where he proclaimed the Faith to his customers, who
brought him their horses and mules to be shod. He would
commence his task by tying down the animal’s legs, busy the
customer with holding the bridle, and immediately engage him in
teaching discussions.

One day, as was his custom, the honored [Mírzá] Abú’l-Fadl
was going on pilgrimage to the [Sháh ‘Abdu’l-‘Azím] Shrine, when
he had to stop by Na‘lband’s shop for some repair. Ustád Husayn
warmly greeted him and while engaged in the repairs, he inquired,
“My master, I have a question.” [Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl] signified his
permission for the query to be presented to him. The farrier asked,
“I have heard that there is a hadith [i.e. Islamic tradition] indicating
that angels do not visit a home wherein a dog dwells. Is this true?”
“Yes, it is correct,” was Mírzá’s reply. “O honored Shaykh,” the
shoe-smith responded, “now the matter becomes complex.”
“Why?” asked Mírzá. “I have also heard that there is another true
tradition that states that each raindrop is carried by an angel. Is this
also correct?” “Yes, indeed,” Mírzá replied. “Well, your answer has
added to my confusion, since in that case, rain should never fall on
homes in which a dog is kept, whereas we see that it rains uniformly,
regardless of the existence of pets.” Perplexed, the Mírzá
admonished him and walked away. Later, he asked a companion as
to the convictions of the farrier and was told, “Do not listen to him.
Áqá Husayn is a well-known Bábí and not worthy of attention.” But
this very comment impelled the honored Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl to take
up a serious investigation of the Faith which eventually resulted in

his conversion by Áqá Muhammad-‘Alí Máhút-furúsh [a broadcloth
salesman].

In short, the illustrious [Mírzá] Abú’l-Fadl remained in Beirut
and made a proof copy of his magnum opus for which he had
previously completed all the required research. This book was in
response to all the polemics against the Faith, and one part, which
by itself was a mighty tract, was in response to Athím ibn Athím127.
Another part, in itself a thick book, was a response to the Azalís and
outlined irrefutable proofs for the validity of Bahá’u’lláh’s claim.
Another section addressed materialists and opponents of the Cause,
while yet another was devoted to the Covenant and the activities of
the violators of the divine Testament.

As was my habit, each day after completing my studies and
finishing at the hospital, I would attain his presence and present him
with telegrams, correspondence and any other Bahá’í news that was
received, including news of the arrival or departure of visitors. In
particular, when newspapers or periodicals mentioned the Faith, I
would share with him an outline of the article and other pertinent
details.

One day in the college library, as I was looking through
various magazines and journals, I saw an advertisement in a Jesuit
magazine published by the renowned Catholic scholar, Louis
Shaikhuan, regarding the Kitáb Nuqtatu’l-Káf published by Prof.
Browne. When I informed the honored [Mírzá] Abú’l-Fadl, without
the least pause, he said, “Go immediately to Beirut Jesuit Publishing,
inquire for the representative of Louis Shaikhuan128, the owner of
the publishing house, and ask the cost of printing a book, about one
thousand pages, on good quality paper and large fonts, so that I can
start composing it and give it to him section by section for printing.”

He also instructed, “Write this question, have it signed by all
the students in Beirut and send it to Prof Browne, the instructor of

127 Athím [sinner] was a penname of Hájí Mírzá Karím Khán Kirmání, the self-
proclaimed head of Kirmání Shaykhís. His son, Hájí Muhammad, also adopted the
same epithet.
128 The original text gives the name as Shaikhu.

Eastern Languages in Cambridge University, asking for the favor of
reply.”129 I did as bidden and with registered post sent the notarized
petition to Prof. Browne. Twelve days later, I received a reply in
Prof Browne’s own hand in Persian. This in truth was the best and
most precious document in refutation of the Nuqtatu’l-Káf and the
fraudulent attempt to tie it to the martyred Hájí Mírzá Jání [of
Káshán]. When the late Mírzá [Abú’l-Fadl] saw this letter, he was so
jubilant that he nearly started dancing and was constantly laughing
and immensely delighted. Indeed his state of joy [over this
admission] can never be described. With this irrefutable document,
which Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl considered the best lightning rod against the
enemies of the Cause, the decision to publish a response was
finalized.

Often he would say, “As the Faith gains strength and as its
influence is extended, its enemies will grow more determined and
exert their utmost evil against it, resorting to any means, lies, or
slanders to attack and eradicate the Tree of God. Even if our
enemies are in disagreement [over ways to oppose the Cause], they
will gain synergy from other camps attacking the Faith and will be
united in their purpose.” In this regard, he often recited this verse:

Verily they have plotted their plot, and their plot is with
> God, though their plot were one whereby the mountains should be
> moved”130 and “Had We sent down this Qur'án on a mountain,
> verily, thou wouldst have seen it humble itself and cleave asunder
> for fear of God.131

In short, while we awaited ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s approval, final
129 The question posed to Prof Browne by Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl through the students of
Beirut was about the source and authenticity of the book [The Nuqtatu’l-Káf]. He
replied that he had acquired it from the library of [Comte Joseph A.] Gobineau. It is
evident that Muhammad Khan Qazvíní had interpolated the text and deposited it in
the library. (HM). [For Qazvíní’s own admission see, “‘Abdu’l-Bahá Meeting with
Two Prominent Iranians”, Ahang Rabbani, World Order magazine, Fall 1998.]

copies of his various notebooks containing his rebuttal were
prepared and readied for submittal to the publisher. We telegraphed
America, asking for the Master’s permission, and He immediately
cabled:

From New York. The Iranian Khudábakhsh.132
American College in Beirut.

> Imperative publish book with great haste. Print in Egypt.

‘Abbás.

Upon the receipt of the above telegraph, Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl left
for Cairo and, after a while, passed away in that realm, attaining his
permanent place in Almighty’s Grace, with the book remaining
incomplete. [During his final days,] when he was not well and
unconscious, a section of this manuscript was stolen by Dr.
Amínu’lláh Faríd, son of Mírzá Asadu’lláh Isfahání, who wished to
publish it in his own name and thereby gain universal notice. This
unscrupulous act, which severely harmed the Cause of God, greatly
perturbed ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Who expelled him from the Faith. The
Master stated, “This thievery will result in his defeat and ruin. ‘Soon
the tyrants will know of their doing. Where art Thou, O Reformer of
upheavals? Verily, thy Lord is the One Who schemes.’”

In short, in addition to his worldly achievements, the
illustrious Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl possessed outstanding heavenly
qualities. He was polite, unassuming, jovial, serene and spiritual.
Those who had seen him in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would
readily testify to his utter humility and discerning eyes. On such
occasions, he would leave his walking stick outside, and with hands
folded over his chest and trembling body, would enter [the room].
He would then bow all the way down and, after receiving permission
would sit, keeping his hands over his chest, his eyes cast downward
and his body motionless. He never spoke in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, and when a response was required of him by the Master, he

132   Cable-address for me. (HM)

would immediately stand and with a few words provide a sufficient
reply, then once more regain his previous posture. In His presence,
he was all ears and was, in truth, a manifestation of this verse of
Hafiz <70>:

One cannot speak in the chambers of the Beloved,

As all faculties must become eyes and ears.

Most reverently, he would ponder every word spoken by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. At leave-taking, he would back away towards the
door, never turning his back to the Master. Once outside, he
radiated immense joy, delight and rapture and at all times praised the
bounties of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and divine favors, reciting this verse, “They
taunt thee with having embraced Islam. Say: Taunt me not with your having
embraced Islam; God rather taunteth you with His having guided you to the
faith -- acknowledge this if ye are sincere.”133

Though Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl was only a seminary student, yet the
power of the Word of God and the influence of Divine Sovereignty
can make a heap of dust the envy of the heavens and breathe a new
spirit into moldering bones. This effect had transmuted this small,
frail man into the envy of the world, whose writings shine
resplendently as a sun in both the East and the West, guiding the
seekers of the Beloved to their ultimate goal and diffusing his
sanctified fragrance throughout the world.

If anyone spoke his praise, Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl would become
very embarrassed and only speak of his own shortcomings,
particularly expressing his immense regret over his weakness and ill
state. He would note that because of these infirmities, he was not
able to serve the Faith the way his heart demanded. He used to say,
“My earnest desire is to be granted a thousand lives a day so I could
sacrifice them all in the path of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá!” In all gatherings, his
sole expression was that of abject humility and nothingness. I take
refuge with God, never was he heard to say, “I”, or in any way speak

133   Qur’án 49:17.

of himself. He was the quintessence of lowliness and humility, and
his tongue always turned in praise of God and the infinite bounties
bestowed by the Author of Revelation. He repeatedly stated, “If it
had not been for the divine grace, I would now be but a seminary
student in a corner of a mosque.”

When we asked him how it was that he had acquired such
immense knowledge, depth of learning, complete mastery of the
most abstruse subjects, and become a true mystic, he would say, “I
learned everything in the school of God’s Faith. I have partaken of
the spiritual feast of the Center of the Covenant, as I have no
powers or abilities of my own. The likes of me are many in Iran
though because of their lack of recognition, they have come to
naught. However, solely from the Grace of God, rays of the divine
effulgence of our Sanctified Beloved shine unceasingly upon the
believers and bestow on them manifold bounties. The heavenly feast
is spread, and the door to the Lord’s House is flung wide open.
Under the standard of the Cause anyone can be a teacher to Abú’l-
Fadl. Abú’l-Fadl is nothing! Abú’l-Fadl is most insignificant!”

The illustrious [Mírzá] Abú’l-Fadl always warned us and would
exhort, “The enemies of the Faith and the evildoers are constantly
scheming and poised to attack. You must be vigilant and not fall
prey to the words of [ill-meaning] people. Our opponents will first
approach you in the guise of friends so that they can subtly win your
sympathies. Once they have gained your confidence, then they will
sow the seeds of doubt in the soil of your heart and take an axe to
the root of the Faith. The enemies of the Faith are not one or two
or just a few thousand. All the diverse denominations and religious
factions will arise in opposition to God’s Faith.”

Repeatedly, he recited this verse, “Had we sent down this Qur’án
on some mountain, thou wouldst certainly have seen it humbling itself and
cleaving asunder for the fear of God.”134 and would recite this verse of
Sa‘dí:

Snake will bite man’s foot,

When he fears that he would be killed.

He would also say, “The whole of mankind is trembling and
fearful of the influence and the penetration of the Cause.”

The Reasons for the Expulsion of Dr. Amínu’lláh Faríd,
son of Asadu’lláh Isfahání135
For twenty years, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá funded the studies of this person
[Faríd] and eventually he became a physician. [Having been
showered with all these bounties,] it was hoped that he would
become a sincere servant of the Cause, would grow as a fruitful and
fertile tree under the canopy of the Faith and would devote his life
to its service, thereby repaying all the effort of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on his
behalf. Regrettably, egotism and self-indulgence, coupled with the
lack of religious and spiritual conviction, finally brought out his true
self and, for him, made materialism victorious over spirituality. His
satanic self was ultimately triumphant and caused him to perpetrate
such deeds that caused his expulsion from the Faith, earning an
eternal curse. O Lord, save us all from ourselves!

On the occasion of the expulsion of Dr. Amínu’lláh Faríd,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá summoned me one day and instructed me to travel to
Europe. He spoke with great pain, and he paced back and forth with
His headdress removed. He made His remarks with such incredible
force and conviction that they truly made me tremble uncontrollably
to the point that I nearly fainted. He said:

> Do you know why His Holiness the Exalted One [the
> Báb] was martyred and the Blessed Beauty sustained
> such life-long hardships and sufferings? Do you
135Dr. Faríd’s mother was the sister of Munírih Khánum, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s wife. Mírzá
Asadu’lláh was the emissary who had taken the remains of the Báb from Iran to the
Holy Land. For details see “Efforts to Preserve the Remains of the Báb: Four
Historical Accounts”, Ahang Rabbani, Bahá’í Studies Review, 2003, pp 83-95.

He spoke of Faríd and said, “Never argue with anyone,” and then
added:

> Is it rational for us to aid him? If a thief wants to enter a

Sijn” was engraved on it. He would sign the Tablets “‘Ayn ‘Ayn” and seal them on
the upper right corner. Afterwards, He commenced signing, “‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‘Abbás.”

announce it publicly.

Ask Mírzá Mahmúd Zarqání to tell you each of his
[Faríd’s] actions and you inform the friends.

That afternoon, in accordance with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s instructions,
Mírzá Mahmúd Zarqání came to see me and said:

The first meeting of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá with the American Bahá’ís took place on 11

\[137\] 
April 1912 at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Edward B. Kinney of New York.

1.       Faríd wanted to have a separate residence where

3.       Late one night, when Mrs. Pinchot139 was

138 The implication is that by not showing a draft to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and not enclosing
the original Tablet, Faríd was mistranslating the Text and passing his own writings as
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s.
139 Gifford Pinchot (11 August 1865, Simsbury, Connecticut – 4 Oct. 1946, New

York City), American conservationist and politician, was the first Chief of Forest
Service, 1905-10 and later Governor of Pennsylvania. He invited ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
His travel-companions to his estate on 3 June 1912 in Milford, Pennsylvania. His
mother was Mary Jane (Eno) Pinchot, (1838 New York City – 1914 Simsbury,
Conn.). She was the wife of James Pinchot (1831 -1908) and in 1900 moved from
New York City to Washington, DC. It was in the latter city that she met ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá on 10 May 1912.

[Bahá’ís of Beirut]
During the years 1910-12, the city of Beirut had emerged as an
important post for the Cause and through an increase in the Bahá’í
students our number had grown to about forty. As they witnessed
the joy, sincerity, humility, and unity of the friends, non-Bahá’ís also
joined us and discontinued their association with other Iranians in
Beirut. These included: Dr. Ridá Khán Tahmasb, Mahmúd Khán
Fátih and Ya‘qub Khán Armaní [Christian] Urúmíyyih.

From the port of Naples in Italy, the illustrious Shoghi
Effendi, who was scheduled to leave with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for Europe,
returned and joined us at Beirut University. Because of their
conflicts with the Turks, the Italians in Naples had been dithering
[thinking ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and His entourage were Turks]. Dr.
Amínu’lláh Faríd had taken advantage of the situation and, under
the pretext that they had an infection of the eyes, prevented the
illustrious Shoghi Effendi, Mírzá Munír Zayn142 and Khusraw
Khádim [attendant] from joining ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. It was divine
wisdom that brought Shoghi Effendi to the College at Beirut and
bestowed this honor upon the American University.

142A son of Zaynu’l-Muqarribín, he was one of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s two secretaries. The
other was Mírzá Mahmúd Zarqání.

During his years at College, Shoghi Effendi conducted himself
like any other student, without demanding the least preferential
treatment or privilege. No one was aware of his future [office], and
he himself did not expect any special consideration from anyone.
Several times, the honored Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí remarked, “This
old servant has said to Shoghi Effendi, ‘It is sufficient for you to
attend the school of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and to wear a garb like His,’ but
he paid no attention.” We heeded not such talk as our sole focus
was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and we saw none besides the Master. All the rest,
we considered to be different than Him, and if anyone spoke
otherwise, we viewed it as disunity in the Cause. Even once, my
father, the late Hájí Khudábakhsh, who for a second time had come
to the Holy Land and attained the blessed presence, was critical of
our behavior towards Shoghi Effendi. Several times he exhorted me,
“Change your ways towards the eminent Shoghi Effendi and know
that this wondrous youth is the Master’s successor.” But we had
been so concerned with the Covenant and the Testament that we
were uninterested in all else. When I heard my father’s words, I
protested vigorously, saying, “What manner of talk and speech is

this? Discard such notions and thoughts! Despite [Bahá’u’lláh’s]
explicit commands and exhortations [to remain focused on the
Master], you wish to name a successor for the Master?” My father
remained silent, and only at the end he said, “By God, this youth will
be the successor of the Master as his eyes are like the eyes of the
Master and his manners are like His.” He said this and no more, and
I too thought it best not to pursue the matter, as my father was my
guest for only a few days in Beirut. But now, I testify to my own
spiritual blindness and my father’s sagacity. Indeed it was the same
discerning eyes [of my father] that, when the whole of mankind was
heedless, upon hearing the Call of the Beloved, “Am I not thy
God?” responded, “Yea, yea!” and ranked among the believers of
the first epoch of this Cause, faithful to the very last breath.

During these years the number of students in Beirut had
grown considerably, and the majority were enrolled at the
[Protestant] College. Ghulám-Husayn Ibtiháj and Abú’l-Hasan
Ibtiháj, two sons of the honored Ibtiháju’l-Mulk Rashtí, who were in
Paris, were dispatched to Beirut by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá with instructions
for me to serve as their guardian. Soon thereafter, through the
national bank, the honored Ibtiháju’l-Mulk sent me a check for sixty
pounds. Though I was thoroughly destitute, I sent it back to him in
accordance with the [Persian] saying, “Treasure in sleeve with pocket
to let, rejecting the offer.” I also enclosed a harshly worded letter.
However, the Ibtiháju’l-Mulk did not heed my objection and, once
more, sent the same sum in the care of Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí,
asking him to appeal to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that I be compelled to accept
this sum. However, as the Master was aware of my inner thoughts,
He revealed the following Tablet in honor of Hájí Mírzá Haydar-
‘Alí:

> The honored Áqá Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí, upon whom rest the Glory
of God.

O thou who art firm in the Covenant! The letter thou hast
> written for Mírzá Munír has been perused and despite the shortage
> of time, a brief reply is provided.

The response offered by Mírzá Habíbu’lláh [Mú’ayyad] is
> praiseworthy. Of a certainty, the honored Ibtiháj will need to
> expend this sum on other requirements of the Divine Path. That
> is, it must be sent to Dr. Muhammad Khán Mahallátí in Paris,
> because he had previously supervised Ibtiháj’s sons and for this
> service had received an annual stipend from the honored Ibtiháj.
> However, since I sent the sons to Beirut, this salary arrangement is

best of ways.

The sums that the illustrious Afnáns and others have

My Third and Fourth Years of Medical School in
Beirut, 1913-14
Overcoming various hardships and difficulties, I managed to
complete the third and fourth years of my medical studies and, by
divine grace, received a diploma from the Ottoman and American
governments. I sent the following telegram to the sacred presence of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

> Haifa. Hadrat ‘Abdu’l-Bahá                ‘Abbás.     Successfully
> completed. Habíb.

143   Lit. the City of God, a reference to Baghdad; see Arabic Tablet of Ahmad.
144   The remainder of the Tablet not quoted by the author.

Praise be to God that under the shadow of the Master’s
guidance, I was able to complete my medical studies though I had
no will of my own, and indeed had not thought about becoming a
physician, but ‘Abdu’l-Bahá guided and encouraged me to enter this
profession. In a Tablet, He had revealed:

> Since Iran is in need of physicians, it is best and of prime
> importance to study medical sciences.

Therefore, despite my own shortcomings and lack of ability,
but through obedience to His wishes, this servant studied as bidden.
Day and night, I was busy with my schoolwork, and when there was
a little time left to me – moments when other students played,
relaxed or swam – I devoted it to meeting Bahá’ís and being in their
service. I spent the summers under the shadow of the Shrine of the
Báb on Mount Carmel – an immense bounty that bestowed untold
benefits on me.

[‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Egypt]
During the time that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sojourned in Alexandria145, on
two occasions I attained His august presence with other students
and for several days partook of the divine feast spread for the
friends, gaining much from His heavenly teachings.146 Rank upon
rank of the friends and nonbelievers also attained the Master’s
presence and benefited from His association. His sun of glory
radiated most brilliantly, and the billowing ocean of His utterances
surged forth mightily, and the feast of His bounties was spread most
abundantly, enthralling and captivating each listener. To the extent

145 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was in Alexandria from October 1910 to 11 August 1911, from
December 1911 to March 1912, and from 17 July 1913 to 2 December 1913. For
details see, Ahmad Sohrab, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Egypt.
146 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Egypt 329 records that Dr. Mú’ayyad and eight other Bahá’í

students arrived at Ramleh, Egypt, on 18 September 1913.

of his own capacity, each person benefited from these heavenly
words and stored those spiritual gems for future times. Spirits were
filled with joy and delight, and tongues turned in praise and gratitude
to God.

One day ‘Abdu’l-Bahá summoned this unworthy servant, and
in His presence, we walked the busy streets of Alexandria. As He
walked, He described for me the glory, the majesty, the might and
the splendor of the Imams of Islam, upon Whom rest God’s peace.
He said that the martyrdom of each One was in the path of God
and He particularly showered His praise and tribute on His Holiness
‘Alí and Husayn, peace be upon both. He then recited the following
verses, and line by line translated them [from Arabic into Persian],
interpreting each phrase. He explained and interpreted these with
such potency that the sweetness of His words and the effect of that
experience will never be erased from memory. Every time I am
overwhelmed with sorrow and sadness, I recall those verses and that
celestial scene, and instantly I am transported to a state of joy and
bliss.147

<80> During one of the nights that I was in His presence, He
spoke about the enemies of the Cause:

They wanted to obliterate the name of the Faith
> from the pages of history. They killed, harmed,
> imprisoned, exiled and did what they could in
> murdering, plundering, injuring and banishing the
> believers; and no one was shown mercy, not even

147The poem in Khátirát Habíb, vol. 1, pp. 111-113 (79-80), is not translated in the
present volume. The present translator is grateful to Omid Ghaemmaqami for
noting, “All of the verses are actually from one and the same poem. The ode can be
found in the diwan that is attributed to Imam ‘Alí. The full citation is: Diwan Amir al-
Mu’minin wa-Sayyid al-Bulagha’ wa-al-Mutakallimin al-Imam ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib. Beirut: Al-
Maktaba al-‘Asriya, 2004. The poem is found on pages 78-82 of the diwan with the
abyat recited by the
Master being on pages 78-80. There are a couple of discrepancies between the
poem as recorded in the Diwan and as it has been mentioned by Dr. Mu’ayyad in his
diary.”

infants, pregnant women, or the disabled. They
committed such heinous deeds that history has never
witnessed their like, and in no other age had the
persecutions been so intense. However, despite the
opposition of the people, the banner of God’s Faith is
hoisted most high and the sovereignty of the Cause and
its divine splendor has enveloped the world.

His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb] was
martyred, though He was the quintessence of meekness.
With bare head and feet, under a scorching sun, the
Blessed Beauty was forced to walk from Niyávarán to
Tihrán. He was held captive in the Síyáh-Chál, where His
neck was made to bear the weight of the Qará-Guhar
chain, and where He lived among thieves, murderers and
criminals. The blood of many innocents was spilled. The
Blessed Beauty was banished a number of times and
eventually exiled to the Most Great Prison where every
minute of His life was in peril. Nevertheless, under the
sword of persecution, the call of the Kingdom reached
the whole of mankind and the standard of the Cause was
planted upon the highest peaks of the world.

Now, they still say the same things and think that if
they slay Me, the divine light will be extinguished. God
forbid! They inflicted the same upon His Holiness the
Exalted One [the Báb] and had the same purpose for the
Blessed Beauty, but it only had the opposite effect. The
lamp of God’s Faith grew brighter, and the fragrance of
divine love perfumed the horizons of the world. This is
precisely why you see that the cry of “Yá ‘Alíyu’l-A‘lá!”
has reached every hearer, and the call of “Yá Bahá’u’l-
Abhá!” has penetrated every heart.

Now is but the beginning of the Dispensation. The
springtime of the Faith is yet to come. We have only
seen the break of the dawn. Soon the sun of the Cause
will rise, and its effulgence will envelop the whole earth,

bestowing life and energy.

If the intention of these people [i.e. the enemies] is
> [to harm] Me, I have repeatedly said that they may do
> unto Me as they desire; and if so inclined, they may slay
> Me, bury Me in the depths of the sea or crucify Me on a
> cross. But if their purpose is to extinguish the light of
> the Faith, “though they hate it, God will protect His
> light, despite the hatred of the infidels, hypocrites and
> violators of the Covenant.”148 …149

He then recited several verses of poems of Abú’l-Hasan
Muhammad ibn ‘Umrán ibn Yaqúb al-Anbárí composed in memory
of Abú-Táhir Muhammad ibn Baqíyyih bin ‘Alí, surnamed the
Násiru’d-Dawlih, the vizier of ‘Azu’d-Dawlih.150 When He recited
these lines, He expressed His longing for martyrdom and said, “I
want to give a sermon when I am crucified,” and with both hands
raised heavenward, He said,

Verily, thou rose to what thou didst preach,

And all rose to prayer.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Journey to Egypt, Europe and America
Once when we were in His presence in ‘Akká, the Master suddenly
said, “Let us go to Haifa and visit the Shrine of the Báb.” In several
carriages, all the pilgrims accompanied Him to Haifa and stayed in
the pilgrim house on Mount Carmel.

powerful ‘Azu’d-Dawlih had said that he wished he had been killed instead and this
fine poem was composed for him.

Haifa

That night151, we saw a ship leaving the harbor going south.

Some said that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was onboard. Soon afterwards, it was
confirmed that indeed He had departed on that steamer, known as
Manyih152 Khadivi. The next vessel took the illustrious Shoghi
Effendi, the honored Áqá Siyyid Asadu’lláh Qumí, the esteemed
Mírzá Núri’d-Dín Zayn and Áqá Khusraw Khádim [attendant] to
the presence of our Beloved in Port Said. We spent that summer [of
1910] in Haifa under the shadow of the Shrine of the Báb.

The story of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s journey to Egypt, Europe and
America is, by itself, a massive account. Each day of it opened a new
vista in the history of the Faith. It has been thoroughly covered by
Bahá’í chroniclers, and therefore this servant will refrain from
further mention.153

We spent the holidays near the Shrine of the Báb and both
outwardly and spiritually partook of the heavenly feast of the Primal
Point. All the students [from Beirut] were present, and in every way

151 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá left Haifa late August 1910.
152 Name was left blank in the original, but description given in Khátirát Habíb, vol. 1,

153 One such account was kept by Mírzá Mahmúd Zarqání and published under the

title of Badíy‘u’l-Áthár, translated as Mahmud’s Diary.

we had a marvelous time. The glad-tidings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá were
continually pouring forth from Egypt, Europe and America. Also at
all times we attained the presence of the illustrious Mírzá Haydar-
‘Alí, that sage philosopher, and immensely benefited from his sweet
utterances and learned counsels. We had no thoughts except singing
the praise of the Beloved, meeting the friends, visiting the Shrines of
Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb, enjoying the Garden of Ridván and
climbing Mount Carmel. At every moment we chanted Bahá’í
anthems and had no care or sorrow, nay, it was all bliss and felicity.

We were completely unconcerned with the world and all that is
therein. This ephemeral servant had composed one or two paeans;
and with utmost joy and elation, we sang these hymns, and our
voices echoed throughout the mountain and the town of Haifa.
Frequently, non-Bahá’ís came to watch us, and beholding our joy,
they too became elated. This is the text of two of the humns:

With melodies, music and aria,

sing out the people of Bahá!

From beyond, cometh nigh this utterance:

lo, shineth forth the sun of His presence;

From the Countenance of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

Grief and sorrow; anguish and ferocity,

fade to naught by His awesome majesty!

Do thou tell me, what sorrow now?

for hath spread the Cause of Bahá;

Through the efforts of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

The wolf and the flock graze with amity,
while eagle and dove fly in harmony!

From the serpent cometh no harm;

for Isaiah’s promise, fulfils this Dawn154

Through the might of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

Sayeth the world with abundant gaiety,

with melody, joy and ecstasy!

Dominion is His, the All-merciful God,

for He has vanished the burden of our wrongs;

Through the grace of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

Once there appeared the Moon, the All-glorious,

the world turned into a paradise all wondrous!

Hail to ye, all dwellers of the earth,

for heavenly hath become this black turf;

Through the appearance of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

Afflicted since it was with ills and pains, our globe,

filled with evil and vice, this, our world!

A banner was raised of God’s glory,

for manifested was the age of grandeur and
majesty;

In the person of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

Time has come now for peace and unity,

so, do thou spread this tiding to humanity!

154Isaiah 27:1 states: In that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword
shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and
he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea. (King James)

Evident it is to the entire world,

that hast perished tyranny and woe;

Through the majesty of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

Witness the world so enthralled and rapturous,

with thy soul, behold His Covenant, so wondrous!

Every lover’s desire, do thou see,

now the very self of Bahá

In the vesture of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

And this is the hymn that was sung at the dinner table in ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá residence:

> O ye band of lovers,
> melting away in separation’s pain!

> Sing ye this song: for lo,
> life hath been bestowed anew!

> Let Him live forever this Branch Eternal
> our Master, His Holiness ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

> Darksome night of separation hath come to pass,
> for the Sun of Glory hath dawned at last!

> To abyss, hath perished every wicked;
> for His Covenant hath now appeared!

> Let Him live forever this Branch Eternal
our Master, His Holiness ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

The Light of Truth is shining bright,
the Sun of Reality is radiating light!

To sing His praises, we must;
for life hath been breathed into dust!

> Let Him live forever this Branch Eternal
> our Master, His Holiness ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

From the West, each and all,
those with woes, travails and trials;

be they Jews or gentiles;
have arrived jubilant and joyous!

> Let Him live forever this Branch Eternal
> our Master, His Holiness ‘Abdu’l-Baha

The Messiah of the Age,
for the healing of the ails;

with the panacea of love and grace,
hath graciously arrived to grant benevolence!

> <85> Let Him live forever this Branch Eternal
> our Master, His Holiness ‘Abdu’l-Baha

Our Commander and Master He is;
our Judge and Saintly Father He is!

Manifestation of the Lord of Hosts;
hath arrived like the King of the worlds

our Master, His Holiness ‘Abdu’l-Baha

> Merrily, with glory and splendour;
> He hath come in the garb of servitude!

> The Centre of the Lord’s Covenant;
> The Beloved of our soul; so resplendent!

our Master, His Holiness ‘Abdu’l-Baha

> O, Thou majestic Beauty;
> Manifestation of the essence of glory;

> Fixing our gaze on Thy munificence;
> We have gathered round Thy table of benevolence!

our Master, His Holiness ‘Abdu’l-Bahá155

‘Abdu’l-Bahá from the Author’s Perspective
While I was in the Holy Land, people from all strata, races,
ethnicities and backgrounds, whether visitors, resident believers,
easterners or westerners, would attain the presence of the Master.
Each would ask his questions, which hardly ever resembled the ones
posed by others. One inquirer had materialistic tendencies, another,
philosophical proclivities. One would be religious and deeply
attached to his convictions, while another was afire by the love of
his country or was universalistic in his approach, and considered all
people equal and the same. Some were black, others white, some
from Asia, and some were European. While one talked of feminist

155Translation of the above two hymns composed by the diarist were graciously

movements and advocated women’s emancipation, another spoke of
the subjugation of women and the advantages of multiple wives.
One spoke of the needs of the proletariat, while another would ask
the Master of communism. One wished to know about literature
and poetry, another, about history and philosophy. One would ask
about the traditions and prophecies, and sought solutions to
complex problems, while another inquired about the meanings of
abstruse passages in the Sacred Books – passages that had perplexed
him for some time. One was Arab and would present the problem
of Arab liberation, inquiring of its solution; another was Jewish and
wished to know of the future of Palestine.

In short, hundreds of people attained His sacred presence, and
each had his own questions and inquired about matters that
interested him, whether in the field of religion, science or spirituality.
In every instance, they would depart from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence
with the utmost joy and tranquility, praising and glorifying Him.
They were all captivated by His charm and personality and
considered Him an utmost expert and authority in their field of
interest.
In addition to such inquirers, there were many with material needs
and difficulties and they too approached ‘Abdu’l-Bahá with hope of
a solution. Whatever their troubles or material worries, or problems
with adversaries in the governmental agencies or the military
establishment, they considered the Master to be their sole support
and confidant.

In turn, with utmost compassion, He would listen to their
problems, heed their requests, solve their difficulties and, with words
of encouragement and comfort, send them away happy and hopeful.
When poets, scholars, scientists and men of letters attained ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s presence, they would instinctively began to extol and exalt
the Center of the Covenant. In particular Arab poets – whether
Muslim, Druze156 or Christian – would spontaneously compose
156Founded in the eleventh CE by the Persian immigrant Hamza Ibn ‘Alí Ibn
Ahmad, it is a sect of Islam which reveres the Fátimid caliph al-Hakím, and
incorporates elements of Christianity and Greek philosophy.

elegant verses extolling the Master. At times, these poems exhibited
the highest degree of eloquence and beauty, and were read by them
in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and then decorated and given to
Him with great respect. He always graciously received such papers
and when they had left, would tear the papers up and throw them
away.

In summary, He was a spiritual teacher for the world, and His
sacred teachings were universal and of great benefit to all people.
His knowledge was innate, not acquired. Despite the onrush of
troubles and the onslaught of enemies, He was never gloomy or
disconsolate. Each moment He was brighter and happier than the
instant before and easily communicated His joy to others who were
touched by His delight, elation and humility. His words penetrated
the very core of one’s being and would even humble His most
resolute adversaries. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s spiritual teachings were firmly
founded on the basis of justice, the elimination of differences, the
resolution of difficulties, the unification of men, the establishment
of universal peace and the inauguration of a new divine order. He
exerted great efforts to bring about spiritual and physical comfort,
and material and eternal happiness to the grief-stricken inhabitants
of this world, and give hope and courage to every despondent and
desolate hearer of His words. Truly, His ways caused one to become
detached from worldly cares, bestowed immense serenity and
enabled one’s soul to ascend to higher planes.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s eating habits were most amazing and
noteworthy. Often at the dinner table, holding a pitcher of water
and speaking, He would serve food and assure the comfort of His
guests. He would eat only after everyone had dined. His bites were
very small, less than the size of an almond, and would be chewed
very well. He ate extremely slowly, did not like meat, nor cared very
much for fruits, but occasionally took a tangerine or a sweet lemon.
Most of the time His food was bread, milk, cheese, and raw
vegetables, particularly mint, tarragon and sweet basil. Altogether,
He ate little and drank very hot tea, which towards the end of His

life was changed to herbal tea157. He ate and slept very little.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the Eyes of Others
Many eastern and western observers and European and American
travelers have written extensively about their experiences of attaining
the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and their feelings during such
encounters. Moreover, there are many oral accounts about the
influence and the majesty of His blessed Person, or which share
delightful memories of hours spent with Him. Nevertheless, no
discerning writer has been able to befittingly sculpt words and
phrases to describe the qualities and attributes that defined ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, nor has any skilled painter been able to befittingly capture His
myriad expressions. However, if we were to carefully consider these
accounts and to deeply reflect on the reports of those who attained
His presence, we would arrive at the irrefutable conclusion that each,
in his own limited way, has spoken of His majesty, splendor, power
and perfection.

Before the august presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, each visitor
considered himself most insignificant, his own thoughts flawed, his
own pen erring and his understanding inadequate, testifying to his
own inability to fully grasp the Master’s essence and attributes. For
instance, one has likened Him to a powerful monarch with a
corresponding measure of radiance and glory, Who was also the
embodiment of humility, compassion and modesty, and saw himself
as unimportant and petty in relation to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Another has
described Him as an accomplished, true mystic, while another has
emphasized His generosity and was awed by the Master’s depth of
commitment to charity. Yet another has seen Him as an elderly man,
but possessing utmost power and strength, while another has viewed
Him as a prisoner, yet with sovereign might and unbounded
grandeur. One has called Him a pillar of light, and another has

\[157\] 
mint family.

referred to Him as a manifestation of pure spirit. One has become
self-renouncing upon meeting ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, has testified to his own
nothingness and poverty, and spoken of the wonder of His person.
One has bowed before the heavenly radiance of His person, and
considered Him the possessor of unimpeachable and trenchant
judgment, life-giving breath and magnetic and wondrous spirituality.
One has noted that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was unrivaled in the religious
realm and sciences, likening Him to a teacher who has taught those
subject matters for a great many years, possessing innate knowledge
of all the Sacred Books of the past and capable of their absolute and
total recall, able to discern and expatiate their innermost meanings
and mysteries.

Yet another, out of prejudice and ignorance, has attempted to
dispute with Him. For instance, there was a certain Sunni by the
name of Hájí Sádiq Afghání who was deeply biased, odious, fanatical
in religious matters, and antagonistic towards ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the
extent that every time he saw the Master, he turned, looked the
other way and changed his course. One day he became ill and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá told Áqá Ridá Qannád to arrange for a doctor to visit
this man each morning and evening and to charge the cost to the
Master’s account. <90> Moreover, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá emphasized that all
his medications be provided and that Áqá Ridá check and arrange
for whatever provisions or funds this man’s family required. It
proceeded thus for a while and the physician regularly visited him
until the Afghání became well. He never forgot this compassionate
charity of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and was frequently heard to remark,
“Except for ‘Abbás Effendi, no one came to my rescue or saw to my
needs. How am I to forget this immense kindness?!” From then on,
his behavior and attitude completely changed, and whenever he saw
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, he would rush forth and kiss the Master’s hands and
express his obedience and servitude.158

Another was the chief minister of education of Beirut, a
thoroughly irreligious man, bent on dispute and contention. When
158 A somewhat different version of the same incident is told in Myron H. Phelps,
Life and Teachings of Abbas Effendi, pp. 8-10.

he arrived in ‘Akká and attained ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence, he heard
Him speak on such topics as divinity, oneness of God, and belief
and certitude in the Authors of the sacred religions. However, he
began to argue and rejected everything spiritual. No amount of
exhortation had the least effect. He departed the following day for
Beirut and assumed his previous post. But two or three days had
hardly passed when he sent a telegram to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Turkish,
stating, “I deeply regret my words and the manner of my conduct,
and humbly kiss the hem of Your garment. Once more I apologize
for what transpired and seek Your forgiveness.”

In sum, in the course of the very first meeting with the Master
and hearing His short and wise discourse, and witnessing His
sanctified manners and conduct, the visitor would be overcome with
awe and wonder and testify to His majesty and might. For instance,
I remember well that at that time a very learned woman from
England by the name of Miss [Alice] Buckton159 came carrying a
large case of books for the sole purpose of converting the Master to
Christianity. However in the course of her first interview she was so
impressed and enchanted with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that without ever
opening the suitcase of books, she returned to England filled with
profound love and admiration for the Master and for many years
wrote of Him in various journals and spoke glowingly of the Cause
of God, serving it with great distinction.

A philosopher would speak of sciences with the Master and
[afterwards] would describe Him as superior in knowledge to all
natural scientists of the past or contemporary philosophers. And
when he had heard full and sufficient response to his complex
scientific queries, he would express gratitude and praise and leave in
a state of utmost joy and felicity.

There was a professor of literature who, after engaging
‘Abdu’l-Bahá in matters of interest, had declared himself an
unlettered child and had professed immense respect and humility for
159She was the author of the Christmas mystery play, Eager Heart, the Dawn of Day,
and other plays. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá saw this play on 22 December 1912 in London’s
Church House, Westminster.

the Master. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá interpreted this Arabic poem:

The delicacy of glass and the grace of wine

are opposite yet similar,
As if there were wine but no cup,

or there were chalice but no wine.

He spoke in Turkish in exposition of the works of Sa‘dí and
others.

A teacher of history spoke in the Master’s presence of the
evolution and conflicts of history, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, much like a
skilled painter, outlined for him a lively and meaningful perspective
that truly evoked the wonder and admiration of the listeners,
prompting everyone to testify to His all-encompassing knowledge
and erudition.

Another was a physician who in the Master’s presence spoke
of issues related to medicine and remedies. Like a seasoned
physician and a highly trained specialist with years of experience
who was singularly recognized for his learning and discoveries,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá commenced to discuss the minute details of medicine
and anatomy. One by one, He explained the function of each organ
and disclosed before our astonished eyes the hidden secrets of the
body and the wisdom of creation behind various parts. In a state of
wonder and utter astonishment, we bowed our heads in respect and
exchanged words in praise of His greatness.

The words He spoke and shared were indeed but a drop from
the infinite ocean of God’s knowledge, and represented a brief
effulgence from the immense divine resplendence. In truth, what He
uttered during this time is well beyond the comprehension of man in
the present age and is meant for as yet unborn and distant
generations that will benefit from them for at least a thousand years!
His immense learning was not limited to one or two subject matters,
but encompassed the whole range of knowledge, including science,
literature, history, religion, philosophy, social issues, economics, and
the reform and administration of the world. He spoke of and

exemplified things that are essential for happiness, promote spiritual
growth and assure progress and attainment for humanity, and cause
nearness to God. Whatever question or topic was presented to Him,
without the least hesitation, He would provide sufficient and
complete answers, causing amazement in the inquirer, who would
readily testify to His superior knowledge and insights and share
these sentiments openly.

What was even more bewildering was that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had
not studied in any school. Everyone testifies that banishment, exiles,
confinement in prisons, never-ending trials and tribulations, and the
assault of unrelenting enemies consumed His life. Therefore, one
may ask: From where did He acquire such refined moralities, the
knowledge of the secrets and mysteries of nature and the world
above? The answer is simple: for Him, there was no school but
divine inspiration and no training except the teachings of
Bahá’u’lláh.

With such power, majesty, mastery of knowledge and grasp of
topics, every thought and moment of His precious life was
consecrated to the service of others, the promotion of spirituality,
the promulgation of divine teachings, the education of people in the
fundamental doctrines of the Faith, reform and the betterment of
the society of men and the universal brotherhood of mankind. His
tongue and pen moved unceasingly to educate and exhort men and
women to moral and ethical standards and the attainment of
perfection. He labored until a large multitude from diverse
backgrounds and races were enrolled under the banner of the Cause
of God and were illumined by the recognition of the Divine Being,
and became endowed by celestial attributes and human perfections.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá called them “the Apostles of Bahá’u’lláh”.160

Despite all the troubles, difficulties, injuries, imprisonment,
opposition, hostilities, and threats that surrounded every instant of
His life, which gave no opportunity for a moment’s respite, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá was never fatigued or depressed and was never heard to

‘Abdu’l-Bahá often referred to the Bahá’ís of North America as “the Apostles of

\[160\] 
Bahá’u’lláh”; see, for example, Tablets of the Divine Plan, p. 49.

complain or show remorse. He was always happy and jubilant in the
midst of difficulties and tribulations, and, unperturbed by the onrush
of obstacles, would share humorous anecdotes to lighten the
moment. In fact, during such times, He would engage in trimming
flowerbeds, renovating the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh and other Bahá’í
Holy Places, and even organizing weddings and feasts. He was never
saddened or depressed, except when the violators of the Covenant
had caused the betrayal of a believer or news of disunity among the
friends was received.

In short, from the beginning of His life until the very end,
through divine bounties, He was joyful and confident in the ultimate
triumph and victory of the Faith – a confidence that was
communicated to all those around Him with great facility. During
the height of difficulties and the assault of diverse troubles, He often
recited these verses:

O that life was sweet, instead of bitter,

O that people were agreeable, instead of wroth.
O that it was peace between you and me,

Even if there was ruin between the world and me.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá slept very little, and at nights when He retired,
instead of resting, He prayed and supplicated to the Threshold of
Almighty God. Some nights, along with a few friends, I would
quietly go near His room, and we would hear the murmur of His
voice in meditation and, though we could not recognize the hushed
prayers, nevertheless could make out the words, “O my God, my
Beloved!”

Nevertheless, He was very strong and often walked long
distances. When we went to visit the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, for nearly
twenty minutes He would pump water without any rest.

Mission to Germany, Summer of 1914

After I received my diploma from the American College of Beirut, I
went to Haifa for a few days where I enjoyed ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
immense hospitality, both outwardly and spiritually.161 Frequently, I
attained His presence and was enraptured and enthralled by His
soul-stirring utterances.

19 July 1914, Haifa
Today, without any prior notice, I was summoned to the presence of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá where for over an hour I had the honor of being the
only one in attendance. I stood at attention as He paced and spoke
about the martyrdom of His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb]
and the exiles, banishment and tribulations of Bahá’u’lláh. He
repeatedly emphasized that the purpose of sustaining all these trials
in the path of the Divine Beloved was for the people to become
repentant, awakened and detached, to walk in the ways of God and
to grow in spirituality and sincerity. He then removed His táj162,
allowed His hair to fall over <95> His jubbih163 and in a resonant
and clear voice said to me:

> I want to send you to Europe. I wish for you to perform
> miracles in that land; give eloquent talks. Never consider

161 Bushrú’í, p. 23, states that he, Dr. Mú’ayyad and Ridá Khán Tahmásb, a non-
Bahá’í Iranian student, graduated in June 1914. Bushrú’í, p. 44, states that the author
arrived in the Holy Land on 22 June 1914. It is very likely that Badí‘ Bushrú’í was
traveling with Dr. Mú’ayyad and both arrived at the same time.

Twice more I was summoned that day into His presence and
each time became the recipient of His special bounties and received
His instructions for the [forthcoming] journey.

Together with Mírzá ‘Azízu’lláh Bahádur164 we left for
Europe.165 Hájí Siyyid Yahya166 and Mírzá Asadu’lláh Isfahání167 also
joined us, destined for London, where they planned to speak with

164  Bahádur was a fellow student at Syrian Protestant College where Dr. Mú’ayyad
had just graduated.
165 The Diary of Mírzá Ahmad Sohrab (Star of the West, issue 17 May 1916) quotes

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s comments “to two young college men from the orient as they started
west to ‘promote the glad tidings of the Kingdom of good-will and peace.’” Given
the date of the diary entry, it is clear that the two young men were Mú’ayyad and
Bahádur. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s words were:

> You are the angels of the Kingdom of Abhá; guide the people. You
> are the rays of the Sun of Reality; bestow upon them light. You are
> the trees of the orchard of God; produce loving fruits. You are the
> water of eternal life; allay the thirst of mankind. You are the guides of

and admonish Dr. Faríd.168 Mírzá Mahmúd Zarqání left for India as
well, and Mrs. [Emogene] Hoagg was sent on a mission to Italy.169

We attained ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence several times that day and
in the gatherings [of the friends] received His special and infinite
blessings. Afterwards we departed on the Egyptian sailing vessel
Monya.170 The Master sent the illustrious Shoghi Effendi and a
number of other friends aboard the ship to bid us farewell once
more and to convey His bounties.171 Shoghi Effendi had brought for
us the following Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as a means of introducing
us to the European Bahá’í community:

> Europe.

For the purpose of the diffusion of divine fragrances and to
> visit the friends of God, the honored Áqá Mírzá Habíbu’lláh
> [Mú’ayyad] and Áqá Mírzá ‘Azízu’lláh Khán [Bahádur] are
> permitted to journey to Europe that they may befittingly sacrifice in
the path of God.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‘Abbás.

In short, we traveled to France, Italy, Switzerland and

168 Hasan Balyuzi, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 407, has recorded the following:

> By the middle of the year [1914] the defection of Dr Faríd had come

169 Hasan Balyuzi, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 407, informs that Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar Nakhjavání

was sent at that time for Caucasus.

journey from Haifa to Port Said [in August 1910]. (HM)
171 Khátirát Habíb, vol. 2, p. 42, gives the name of those sent to the ship to bid the

travelers farewell as: Shoghi Effendi, Badí‘ Effendi Bushrú’í, Mrs. Sanderson, Mírzá
Ahmad Sohrab, Áqá Ahmad Yazdí and Husayn Áqá.

Germany and in Germany witnessed the onset of the First World
War, 1914-18. In addition, the honored Mr. [Charles Mason] Remey
and Mr. [George] Latimer came to Stuttgart, and we had many warm
and wonderful gatherings, and were able to propagate the divine
teachings. I have recorded the details of this journey in three
separate notebooks and, should the Almighty grant me time, I will
publish these notes and make them available to all.172

It was then that the following telegram was received from the
Master:

> Through Consul Schwarz:
> Remey, Latimer, Habíb and ‘Azíz must come to Haifa.

‘Abbás.

In light of this cable, therefore with the honored Mr. Remey and
Latimer, we returned to ‘Akká and Haifa.

Dr. Mú’ayyad was able to publish some of these notes and they appear in Khátirát

Holy Land, Fall of 1914

28 September 1914, Customs [Office] in Alexandria
We were distraught all day. They questioned us extensively, and
closely searched our belongings, checked and rechecked our
passports and scrutinized everything. Meticulously, piece by piece,
the officials went through our papers and inspected every page and
all of our possessions. They even confiscated the missives that Mr.
Latimer was carrying [for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá].173 All of our pockets, the
linings of our clothes and every conceivable nook and corner were
very closely examined. Never in the past had we been subjected to
such exact inspections or made to endure such inconvenience.
When we left the Customs area, it seemed as if we were freed from a
prison or had been cured of a severe illness.

We rested a little and then proceeded to the [train] terminal for
Egypt174, where we were welcomed by the honored Áqá
Muhammad-Taqí Isfahání, Hájí Niyáz, [and Abú’l-Qásim]
Gulistánih, dining in the residence of the esteemed Áqá
Muhammad-Taqí. Then we left for the Hotel Bristol to retire for the
evening.

29 September 1914, Cairo
Hájí Niyáz came early in the morning, and together we went to visit

173 Khátirát Habíb, vol. 2, p. 229, states that the package of letters for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
was stolen by the secret police in the Custom Office, and only after the travelers had
reached Haifa had they realized that this package was missing. Some time later, these
letters arrived for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, all opened and stamped by the censor’s office. A
few of them, however, never arrived.
174 Presumably meaning Cairo.

Dr. Sálih175. Afterwards we went to see the editor of the Chihrih-
Namá Newspaper.176 That night over fifty of the divine friends were
gathered in the home of the honored Hájí Mírzá Hasan Khurásání,
and the honored Mr. [Charles Mason] Remey and the esteemed Mr.
[George] Latimer gave extensive talks, translated by this servant. The
friends wished me also to speak, so I told them about the amazing
progress of the Cause of God in Germany. We went to our hotel
afterwards.177

30 September 1914, Cairo
Today, together with our American brethren, we went to see the
Pyramids and the Sphinx [near Giza]. Then, in the company of Dr.
Sálih, we went to the resting-place of the illustrious [Mírzá] Abú’l-
Fadl – may my spirit be a ransom for his remains – and when a súrih
of the Qur’án was recited [in his memory], it seemed as if the spirit
of Abú’l-Fadl had transformed the atmosphere.178 A deep serenity
and an overwhelming spirituality enveloped us and profoundly
touched and affected our traveling party.

That night, a number of friends and seekers were present in
the home of the honored Khurásání, and eloquent talks were
offered. The honored Mírzá Ridá Gulistánih and Shaykh Hasan also
spoke, focusing on proofs about the Manifestation of the Great
Announcement [Bahá’u’lláh].

175 Dr. Sálih was Egyptian and became the first Bahá’í to study in the Syrian
Protestant College of Beirut in 1901; See, “Dr. M. Sálih,” Bahá’í World, vol. IX, p.

\[606\] 176 Chihrih-Namá was a Persian weekly, and its editor was Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-

Muhammad Irání, the Mu’addibu’s-Saltanih, who in the past had been antagonistic
towards the Faith, but upon ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to Alexandria had a change of heart
and became very friendly. With great admiration, this paper reported ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
travels.
177 Khátirát Habíb, vol. 2, p. 229, suggests that the night was spent in the home of

Áqá Muhammad-Taqí Isfahání.
178 Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl’s death took place on 21 January 1914.

1 October 1914, Cairo
Today was the day of farewells. A large number of the friends came
to the [train] station and, unlike the time of our departure in
Germany, great joy and spirituality surrounded all as we said our
good-byes. What was most wonderful was the loving and
affectionate exchange of farewell between the eastern and western
believers, which made for a striking and heart-warming scene. This
marvelous display of love attracted the attention of other travelers
who were observing this heavenly scene, as the spirits in utter
wonder exclaimed, “Sanctified art Thou, Founder of this
resplendent Age!” I recalled vividly that in Stuttgart, when we were
exchanging good-byes, tears streamed forth like spring rain, but now
what an amazing difference!

On the express train, we journeyed from Cairo to Port Said in
four hours, one of which was spent crossing the Suez Canal. In Port
Said we stayed in the Hotel de la Poste [on Al-Gumhúríya Street].

2 October 1914, Port Said
Today we met the honored Hájí Siyyid Javad, Dr. Bashír and
Ibráhím Effendi179. In the afternoon we had a meeting, then visited
the statue of De Lesseps180, and that evening went to the home of
Dr. Bashír where some thirty new converts were present. These
friends had embraced the Faith about a year ago as a result of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s journey and stay in that region. Even though
[Bahá’ís] were not permitted to openly teach the Cause in Egypt, yet
these friends had investigated [and converted] and now, through the
love of God, blazed like towering, flaming conflagrations. They hold
regular unity meetings and when a disagreement appears among
them and a problem comes up at the gatherings, they sit together on

Rabbani, In the Land of Refuge: The Genesis of the Bahá’í Faith in Shiraz..

engineer who built the Suez Canal and started building the Panama Canal.

the sands of the shore, speak of their peerless Beloved and resolve
their differences with utmost love and affection. They had decorated
and framed verses testifying to the appearance of the Great
Announcement and placed them prominently in their shops. What
warmth, what rapture and what devotion!

About a month earlier, two of them had been assaulted with
watermelon rinds and [subjected to] insults and abuse, and the
Shaykh of ‘Abbásí Mosque had cursed and slandered them from the
pulpit, labeling them infidels and heaping all manner of slander and
slurs upon them. Yet these sanctified souls had remained steadfast
as a rock and radiant in the face of all tribulations. Their meetings
were joyful, and they prayed for the guidance of their adversaries.
Indeed, this is naught but the miracle of divine teachings!

3 October 1914, ‘Akká and Haifa
Boarding the Italian ship Strakoz we departed for the Ka‘bih of the
Beloved. The sea was angry on the fourth of October, and at a port
near Jaffa, everyone in the third class cabins was quarantined, except
us. Before the arrival of the Health Department’s agents, someone
had locked the entrance to our accommodation and opened it only
after the agents had left the ship, and thereby we were spared [from
this inconvenience]. We never learned who this person was, but he
must have been sent from the invisible realm as his action rescued
us from an enormous waste of time – perhaps this divine bounty
was bestowed upon us because we had been frugal with the Faith’s
funds and had obtained lower class passages. The Almighty must
have assisted!

That night, our ship anchored at the port of ‘Akká, where we
learned that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had gone to Abu Sinan.181 The next

181 By this time, the situation all across the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East
had become perilous with the British occupation of Egypt, the repressive measures
of Jamal Pasha and the spread of the World War I to the region. In order to protect
the Bahá’í community, some time around September 1914, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá withdrew
them all to the Druze village of Abu Sinan, situated to the east of ‘Akká. In this

morning, we disembarked at the port of Haifa and spent the fifth of
October visiting the friends of God. On the sixth, once more, the
city was blessed with the presence of the Master.182

In the afternoon we all gathered in His presence. Describing
the effect and positive influence of this journey, He stated, “It was
from God and unto Him it returned. It was a very productive
voyage. Its full effect will only become manifest in the future.”

period, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself stayed in ‘Akká with one attendant and occasionally
spent a night or two in Abu Sinan. In the past, Bahá’u’lláh had once stayed with
these friendly people for three months in the foothills of Galilee. See, Hasan
Balyuzi, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, pp. 410-411, and subsequent chapters of the present volume.
182 Bushrú’í, p. 39, confirms that Charles Mason Remey and George Latimer arrived

in Haifa on 5 October 1914 and stayed for 14 days, leaving on 19 October.

I asked ‘Abdu’l-Bahá about the insidious rumors spread by the
violators of the Covenant, that He was ill, bed-ridden and that
others were administering the affairs of the Cause. He responded,
“Those that spread such slanders know not that they are causing
their own demise and destruction. Each word revealed by the
Supreme Pen is endowed with a myriad hidden wisdoms and will
cause worlds of good for the benefit of the Faith. Whatever I say is
for their gain. However, their enmity prevents them from discerning
this truth. This is their test! ‘Blackened will be the face of the one
who is impure!’”

After the meeting, He summoned us and asked of the
condition of the War in Europe. He said, “They asked a German
woman if any news had reached her about her son in the battlefield.
She responded, ‘I have no news. Should he be killed, what good
would it do me if they gave me France in its entirety?!’” Then He
added, “Soon all the ethnic conflicts will be alleviated. National
differences will be no more, and all will be considered one and equal.
<100>Had it not been for the spirit of the Cause of God, by now,
the people would have become so savage that not a single family
could have been seen on the face of the earth!”

7 October 1914, Haifa
Early in the morning I attained ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence. He inquired
of the condition of the believers in Germany, particularly of Consul
Schwarz and his esteemed wife, and expressed His pleasure.183 He
prayed for the protection and safety of Mr. Eckstein’s184 sons and
smilingly said, “At times of trouble, hearts are softened and turn to
God. It is then that people develop capacity to hear [of God].” He
added, “Your journey was good. It served both to spread the Faith

183In April 1913, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had met Consul and Frau Schwarz in Germany.
184Herr Eckstein had served as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s translator on at least one occasion.
On 3 April 1913, the Master addressed a large audience in Stuttgart’s upper hall of
the City (Burger) Museum. Ahmad Sohrab translated into English and Herr Eckstein
then into German. See, Balyuzi, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, pp. 380-1.

and to inspire the friends.”

Once more that afternoon in the German colony and under
the olive trees, I attained ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence, and He again
inquired of our mission. “The friends in Germany have written,” I
responded, “and have asked, ‘O beloved Master! How can vicious
wolves find their way to the lambs of the Kingdom when we have a
kind Shepherd like You!’”

German Colony 1900

I reported on the sincere assistance of Mr. Eckstein, and the
Master offered many affectionate words [for him]. I shared, “A large
and wonderful gathering of the German friends was organized that
was possible only through the power of God! One of the believers
and I were speaking and saying, ‘If we were now in the presence of
the Master, we would boldly implore, ‘O Thou Founder of the
Celestial Sovereignty! Do not allow Thy heart to be perturbed by the
actions of two or three violators of the Covenant.’’” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
responded:

Astaghfuru’lláh! I desire for them everlasting glory.

I remarked, “The Bahá’ís of Germany have said, ‘Never has
history recorded that One of the Sacred Personages Himself travels
from East to West to propagate the Message and to raise the Call of
the Kingdom. However, since the Master was all too aware of the
need to exhort people to adhere to the divine teachings and could
discern the perils that lay ahead for humanity, He Himself rose in
this path so that the proof could be made complete.’”

“A year and half ago,” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “I penned a
general Tablet, and Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar Milání published and
disseminated it. Therein I spoke of all these matters and raised the
call of the Great Announcement for the East and the West. Thus
the proof is complete, and none may complain. Seek this Tablet and
ponder upon it carefully.” He walked a few more paces and then
said, “Locate the verses in the Bible that prohibit associating with
the munáfiqín [hypocrites], as they will be necessary at the
appropriate time.” Later with much care I read the whole of the
Bible, extracted those verses and have kept them since.

Mention of the Lamparter185 family was made to the Master,
and He revealed the following Tablet, which was sent for them:

Stuttgart. Mrs. Lamparter, Friedrich Lamparter [and]
> Otto Lamparter, upon all rest the Glory of God, the Most
> Glorious.

He is God.
O seekers of the Divine Kingdom! Happy are ye that ye
> have turned to God and have lifted your vision from this material

remain firm and steadfast in this path.

The Greatest Name ringstones that ye had requested are
enclosed.

> Upon ye rest the Glory of God, the Most Glorious.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‘Abbás.

That night we attained His presence in a general meeting of
the believers in His residence. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked:

These honored friends have brought many glad-
> tidings from Germany. Twice I was in Stuttgart; once on
> my return [to the Holy Land]. The believers in that city
> are indeed sincere, true and virtuous. The purpose of the

Áqá Siyyid Qásim, chant a prayer.

9 October 1914, the Sorrowful Incident of Bashír
Bashír was a sincere, faithful and hardworking servant in the
Master’s house, and one of his responsibilities was to oversee the
security of the house during the night hours.186 Unsure of the night-
186Bushrú’í, p. 41, notes: “During the days of the Blessed Beauty, Jamál Effendi,
known as Sulaymán Khán Tankábání, who was teaching the Cause in India [i.e.
Burma], brought several youth of that land to the Holy Land for service in the Holy

guards’ vigilance in their duties, he had awaken one night, circled the
courtyard a few times and then had hid. One of the Bahá’í guards
had inquired, “Who goes there?” But Bashír had given no response.
A second time it was asked, and yet no response. The guard then
had fired his gun and the bullet had struck Bashír in the midsection,
causing severe injuries. No one dared report the incident to the
Master, so I went into His presence and informed Him of the
situation. He instructed, “Inform the police inspector, the public
prosecutor and the medical examiner to come and investigate the
matter.” Immediately, His instructions were carried out, and the
officers prepared a report of the incident. Bashír confessed to his
own fault saying, “No other person is responsible, as I had no
enemies. This injury was due to my own negligence.”

Soon the internal inflammations, pain, fever and vomiting
worsened, and his condition became critical. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came by
his bedside and, for about ten minutes, stood there in silence.
Suddenly Bashír opened his eyes and saw the Master standing over
him. He extended his hand and said, “Allah-u-Abhá!” The Master
replied, “Alláh-u-Abhá!” Then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá placed His hand on his
brow and heart and left. Pausing by the entrance, He turned and
said, “It was a divine decree, a divine decree.” He then mounted His
donkey with Badí‘ Effendi [Bushrú’í] holding the bridle and Ustád
Muhammad-‘Alí and another believer walking on either side. I
followed from behind. It was a dark night with the sky dazzling with
stars. Total silence had enveloped us and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was also
completely quiet. When we were near the Shrine of the Báb, He said,
“The injuries of Bashír greatly saddened Me. Although the ascension
of such holy personages is their ultimate bliss because they will soar
like free birds into the heavens, yet their separation is very painful.”
On reaching the home of the honored ‘Abbás-Qulí, [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
said to me, “Áqá Mírzá Habíb, you worked very hard. May God
grant you a befitting reward.” A few minutes later Khusraw brought

Household. These included, Bashír, Khusraw and Isfandíyár, who all remained
faithful in the Covenant to their last breath and were most devoted to ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá.”

the news of Bashír’s ascension.187
The morning was devoted to meeting the friends. The honored Hájí
Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí spoke of the history of the martyrdom of the
King and the Beloved of Martyrs.188 That afternoon I was
summoned into ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence, and He kindly assured me,
“You had a good and enjoyable journey. If you had traveled to
London, it would not have been as pleasant. All the believers in
Germany are firm, steadfast, faithful and sincere. Today, it is the
spirit of the Covenant that animates the world. Wherever the
believers are firm, there is a spirit, and that spirit stems from the
Covenant. It is this spirit that gives life to all. Wherever doubts and
misgivings are experienced by the friends and the odor of Covenant-
breaking is inhaled, that place is dead and barren.”

He then added, “Health-wise I am well. Today I read about
one hundred letters. I am well, but some nights I cannot sleep. Last
night I slept two hours, from four to six. If I stay in a place more
than a few days, then I become sleepless. Nevertheless I am happy
with this condition as I can pray and supplicate to the Abhá
Kingdom, thinking of the friends and pondering the affairs of the
Cause – all of which make Me happy.”

Regarding Freud von Schwarz, I mentioned that his younger
brother had received a Tablet, but he had remained deprived of a
similar bounty. The Master responded, “Very well, I will write.
However all the communications have now been cut off. Foreign

post offices are closed, and there are no other dependable means.
<105> Besides, Europe is not at safety, and letters are lost. But I
will write.”

Regarding the death of the late Bashír, He said, “There was a
wisdom in this. Even in the minute details, there is a larger wisdom.
And when I consider the divine wisdom, then I am comforted. In
truth, he was honest, sincere, uncomplicated and faithful. He served
with utmost devotion and earnestness. However, divine wisdom
decreed it thus.”

That night, when we attained His presence, He showered this
evanescent servant with much kindness and said, “You were tired
and I sent you into town, which made you even more tired.”

He then inquired, “Did you use to ride automobiles in Germany, or
did you walk?”

I said, “There were no cars as all were confiscated for military use.
At times we used the metro; otherwise we walked.”

> He responded, “It is evident that you are used to walking.”
> He asked of the honored Consul Schwarz and remarked, “He had a
nice automobile. He took us one day to [Bad] Mergentheim where
there are warm-water springs.189 For about four hours we were in his
car.” I said, “That whole area is now made into a hospital.” “That is
amazing,” He responded, “the [potency of the] blood of a single
martyr will influence affairs until the end of time; yet the blood of so
many innocent millions is spilled, and no one is there to protest. All
of these wars are for the eternal graves. They remain here for a few
days and then go to their everlasting tomb. This [war] is naught but
for carnal desires. Otherwise, these few days of life are not worth
such blood and carnage.”

He asked if many of the letters [intended for Him] were
confiscated at the borders.

189 In Germany, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wished to travel to Budapest on 7 April 1913, but
Consul Albert Schwarz persuaded Him to visit Bad Mergentheim, about sixty miles
distant from Stuttgart, where the Consul owned the hotel and the mineral bath.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá stayed there for one night and left on 8 April.

“Three or four letters at the German border and one or two in
Alexandria were confiscated,” I replied.

“It is very difficult to communicate now. How about using post
cards for My correspondence?”

> “It will reach them. The Tablets reached them as well,” I suggested.

[He instructed,] “It will reach its destination. Perhaps they will
open some of the envelopes. Write to [Herr] Eckstein, [Consul]
Schwarz, Koestlin190 and others and assure them that their many
kindnesses are always remembered by Me and that at the Sacred
Threshold I will pray for the bestowal of divine bounties upon them.
When it is wise, I will write Myself. There is no harm in [writing]
such things.”
A memorial meeting was organized in the Shrine of the Báb for the
late Bashír Effendi, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke the following:

> The tragic passing of Bashír was indeed sudden. Therein
> lies a great wisdom that will only become apparent at a
later time.

He was brought here as a child and was raised in
> our house. He was a good-natured lad, and all enjoyed

> fell from a high roof, but no harm came to him.
> Immediately he rose and walked away. Indeed, destiny is
> an amazing phenomenon. In truth, he was a good youth
and his death was noble too.

Length or brevity of life is of little consequence.

190 In early April 1913, while in Esslingen, Germany, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá attended a
festival organized by Anna Koestlin for the children, which He enjoyed very much;

desireth, and none may question His choice!

What a fine youth! How good natured, righteous
191 A slight variation of these remarks is reported in the diary of Mírzá Ahmad
Sohrab (Star of the West, issue 9 April 1917) and is quoted below for ease of
reference:

The length and shortness of life is not considered important.

> is to achieve some definite results. If the tree of his life does not yield
> those luscious fruits, the purpose of his existence has not been

Last night, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked to Áqá Siyyid Husayn Afnán193:

192 Also known as Abú-Hurayrih, he was a son of Mírzá Mustafá Naráqí and became
a servant of Bahá’u’lláh after his father’s martyrdom in Tabríz. He and his mother,
Sáhib-Ján, accompanied the Holy Family throughout the various exiles. However,
subsequent to Bahá’u’lláh’s ascension, he became a follower of Mírzá Muhammad-
‘Alí and lived towards the end of his life near Tiberias, on a property belonging to
Mírzá Madji’d-Dín.
193 Most likely a reference to a son of Siyyid ‘Alí Afnán. The latter had married

Bahá’u’lláh’s daughter, Furughíyyih in 1886. Eventually, the entire family was
expelled from the Faith because of their allegiance to Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí.

Praise be unto God that not once did I rest in the
> bed of comfort. At the time of His ascension to the
> Abhá Kingdom, His Holiness Christ had nearly sixty
> believers. However after our passing, there will be in
> excess of one hundred thousand believers. If the Blessed

> letters from the believers in Germany, how jubilant

not been, not one that has already been illuminated.

Mírzá Áqá Khán Núrí, known as the I‘timádu’d-
> Dawlih, was the Prime Minister of Iran. There was a
> disagreement between his son, Mírzá Kázim Khán, the
> Nizámu’l-Mulk, and the Blessed Beauty. In an attempt to
> resolve this problem, he gave his daughter in marriage to
> our uncle, Mírzá Músá [Kalím]. Even though the discord
> was not completely alleviated, outwardly there was
> peace. Mírzá Áqá Khán was related to all the viziers of
> Iran and, therefore, he virtually ruled over the whole
> nation. One night, the Nizámu’l-Mulk said, “The future
> influence of our family is destroyed because of our
> kinship to Mírzá Husayn-‘Alí [Bahá’u’lláh].” The
> I‘timádu’d-Dawlih overheard this comment and noted,
> “No, the families that are established on the foundation
> of religion endure forever. It is ours that is lost!”194

194The following is reported in the diary of Ahmad Sohrab to be the words of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoken on this day (Star of the West, 21 March 1918):

But now after the lapse of many centuries, his highness, the
> Almighty, has again looked upon them with the glance the
> mercifulness, and the cup-bearer of celestial bestowals became
> manifest in the land of Persia. The Sun of Reality shone forth, casting
> the effulgences of graces upon that country. He proclaimed the
> heavenly teachings and instituted the religion of the clement Lord...
The departure of the students for Beirut elicited these comments
from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

I have been informed that you are leaving today,
> and thus, I have come to bid you farewell. In every
> regard, you have had a wonderful summer, surrounded
> by the vivifying air of the Shrine of the Báb and its
> spacious rooms, orchards, flowers and greenery.
> One must always try to bring comfort and well-being to
> others; otherwise, bringing comfort to oneself alone is
easy and can be readily achieved.

When the Commission of Inquiry came [in 1904],
> they made matters difficult for us. They closed the roads,
> installed a magistrate, guards and gendarmes and made
us the object of their slander and calumny. All of our

But, alas, alas! Still the majority of the inhabitants of Persia are
> in sound sleep and have not heard, neither are they informed of the

> the stranger, and the known as though he were unknown. They seem
> to say: “We are satisfied with this degradation. We are comfortable
> amidst all these distractions, dissipations, groveling in dirt and
> uncleanness. We do not want the owner of the house. We are not

> conquering, the fame of his grandeur reaching the ears of the rich and
> the poor alike, others from different parts of the world entering under
> the shade of his sacred tree by cohort and cohort, accepting his
> teachings and receiving a share from the table of his sustenance.

Following are the reported words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in diary of Mírzá Ahmad Sohrab,
(Star of the West, 21 March 1918):

> The Cause of Bahá’u’lláh is the fulfillment of all the prophecies in all
the books of the religions of the world.

> enemies in or outside ‘Akká now became informants,
> preparing reports to send to Constantinople. The very
> people who had instigated this event were now
> appointed as investigators and inquisitors. It should be
> obvious what was wrought by these people. For

> sovereignty in ‘Akká and had built a fortress on Mount
> Carmel. They accused Me of raising the banner [of the
> Greatest Name], circulating it in ‘Akká and then
> exporting it to the various Arab tribes and factions195
> through Mírzá Dhikru’lláh196 in Galilee and Shaykh
> Mahmúd [‘Arabí]. The illustrious personages [i.e.
> members of the Commission] announced this as a
> grievous matter. Our enemies then wrote them that
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had raised the standard of “Yá Bahá’u’l-
> Abhá197” and then appeared before the Commission of
> Inquiry to testify to the validity and accuracy of this
> charge. To affirm this falsity, they even arrayed a range
> of other witnesses. Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí had the
> Greatest Name inscribed by someone on a piece of
> white cloth which he presented to the Commission of
> Inquiry [as evidence]. The chief of the Commission198
> announced, “Sultán ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd has promised me the

beyond Jordan.
196 Son of Mírzá Muhammad-Qulí, the faithful half-brother of Bahá’u’lláh, who had

staunchly upheld the Covenant and stood firm by the side of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. By this
date, Mírzá Muhammad-Qulí was deceased.
197 lit. O Glory of the Most Glorious.
198 It seems at this point in His talk, the Master had proceeded to tell of the events

of the winter of 1907 as the threat of banishment to Fízán belonged to that
Commission of Inquiry – a four-man Commission, chaired by ‘Árif Bey.
199 ‘Akká was under the lordship of the Valí of Damascus.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá be sent to Fízán200? The reply was negative.

My point is that in the midst of this commotion, I
> sent seventy of the believers [to Egypt], including Mírzá
> Asadu’lláh and his wife and provided them all with
> sufficient funds that I had borrowed from an American
> in Paris. My point is that I accepted a great burden [to
> secure the well-bring of the friends]. Then a cargo boat
> came to take Me. The owner of that ship is present at
> the gathering.201 I asked a number [of the friends] to
> assemble. [They included:] Siyyid ‘Alí-Akbar, Siyyid
> Yahyá, Mírzá Asadu’lláh, Áqá [Muhammad-]Ridá
> [Qannád Shírází] and Áqá [Mírzá] Mahmúd [Káshí]. I
> then asked them to consult on the situation, since the

201Hasan Balyuzi, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 121, reports the following:

> One night a man drove from Haifa to ‘Akká in a covered carriage. He
> was an Italian who acted as Consul for Spain. Members of his family
> had the agency for an Italian steamship company. Taking great care
> not to be noticed and recognized he managed to reach the house of
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and asked to meet Him immediately. In the bay was an
> Italian cargo boat which this man, in his great love and regard for
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, had kept waiting, moving it from one end of the bay to

> safe passage to any port of His desire.

Bushrú’í, p. 12, gives the name of this man as Scopinoj and states that he was from
Spain and the ship brought by him was from Italy.

202 The following is recorded in the diary of Mírzá Ahmad Sohrab (Star of the West,
issue 20 August 1918). Sohrab’s entry is dated 12 October 1914, two days earlier
than Dr. Mú’ayyad’s:

The character of the general public is very dark,
> and I pray that each of you will shine like a sun giving

‘Abdu’l-Bahá inquired if news had been received of the students’
arrival at Beirut. “No,” I replied, “but their principal has sent a letter
stating that they will be accepted despite the fact that their tuition
will arrive late.” The Master remarked:

They have trust in us. When we first came to
‘Akká, we behaved in such wise that everyone trusted us.

203 Abú-Dharr Ghifárí, ‘Ammár ibn Yásir, Salmán Fárs and Miqdád ibn ‘Amr were
close companions of Muhammad who, after Prophet’s ascension, refused to give
their allegiance to anyone but ‘Alí. These four are acclaimed by Shi‘is as the first four
of their number.

The Master then addressed the American pilgrims:

Know this, that whosoever in America claims he is
> collecting funds in My name has no association with Me.
> Whoever has attachment to money is remote from the
> Kingdom. Whoever separates himself from money will
> experience nearness to the Kingdom. A person must be

When I was in New York, I told the friends: His

> been able to do so. I desire to attain this goal. Through

> contributed thirty-two hundred lira to Me, but I did not

> another and to aid the needy.209

208 Matthew 10:14 states, “And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your
words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.”
209 A slight variation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s talk for Charles Mason Remey and George

Latimer is given in the diary of Ahmad Sohrab (Star of the West, issue 4 November
1916):

When you return to America say to all the believers in my
> behalf that whenever a person comes to that country, no matter to
> what nationality he may belong, and tries to collect money in my
> name, know that it has no connection with me. I am free from it.
> Whosoever asks for money for me, does so of his own volition. There
> are some people who desire to collect money under all kinds of
> pretexts. I desire to impress upon your minds that I have nothing to
> do with such affairs. I never ask anyone to send me money.
> Whosoever loves money does not love God and whosoever loves
God does not love money.

On the other hand, if some of the believers voluntarily desire
> to help and assist one another or some philanthropic institutions,
> whose objects are for the pubic welfare and progress, it is very good
> and praiseworthy. I do not desire that anyone shall ask money in my

> Those souls who are attached to this world and its wealth are deprived
> of spiritual advancement. The believers must live such an independent
> life that if one comes and begs them to accept money, they should
> refuse him. As long as the souls are not severed, how do they expect
to journey along the ideal path?

From afar, steam from a ship’s engine became visible, and some
thought it was a warship. The Master remarked:

> Why are they perturbed? They are restless. This is a sign

> that every shout is against them.”210 Every noise that is

210 Qur’án 63:4. The full verse is: “They think that every shout is against them. They are

enemies – beware of them then – God do battle with them!”
211 The following version of the same talk is recorded in diary of Mírzá Ahmad

Sohrab (Star of the West, 2 March 1918):

These people who called on us today were in a state of fright.

> They are expecting daily the bombardment of Haifa by the foreign

Hájí ‘Alí mentioned the school in Abu Sinan, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

newspapers. The Master inquired, “What news do you have of the
war?” He reported some of the events of the day. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá then
shared some humorous stories and laughingly stated that once there
were three passengers on a ship: a Muslim, a Christian and a Jew.
The Muslim prayed, “O God, take the life of this Christian!” The
Christian prayed, “Lord, slay this Muslim.” Then they asked the Jew
why he was not saying anything, so he prayed, “O God, accept the
prayers of both of them!”214

Today the Master came to the pilgrim house. Greeting Hájí Mírzá
Haydar-‘Alí, He inquired of his health. The Hájí responded, “If Your
blessed Person is well, then everyone is well.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “I
am well, too. I have been in many places, but never inhaled an air as
vivifying as in this place. If the people of this region were not so
deeply immersed in the acquisition of worldly riches, this entire
mountain would have been developed. However, their sole objective
is to acquire earthly wealth, and of what use, since at the end they
will leave these riches for others and depart with a world of regret.”
He then said to the honored Hájí [Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí], “I have asked
for homemade bread to be baked.” The Hájí inquired, “With sesame
seeds?” “Yes, I have requested that they put sesame on it as well.”
[‘Abdu’l-Bahá continued His remarks:]

The following version of the same story is recorded in the diary of Mírzá Ahmad

\[214\] 
Sohrab (Star of the West, 7 February 1919), but is attributed to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
comments on 20 October 1914:

It is said that once a Mohammadan, a Christian and a Jew were
> rowing in a boat. Suddenly a tempest arose and the boat was tossed
> on the crest of the waves and their lives were in danger. The
> Mohammadan began to pray: “O God! Drown this infidel of a
> Christian!” The Christian supplicated the Almighty: “O Father! Send
> to the bottom of the deep this Moslim!” They observed the Jew was
> not offering any prayer, and therefore asked him: “Why do you not
> pray for relief?” He answered, “I am praying. I am asking the Lord to
answer the prayers of both of you!”

Áqá Haydar-‘Alí always served chilu-kabob215, and

217 Mírzá Javád was a believer in His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb] and had
been a teacher to the ‘Imádu’d-Dawlih. He disliked Azal and Mírzá Áqá Ján and
would often curse them, which caused the other believers to be annoyed with this
behavior. He wrote a book on abrogation of traditions, and when he grew ill, the
Blessed Beauty said to him, “Your remedy is to wash off that book.” He did as
bidden and regained his health. (HM)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá then pointed to me and asked about Germany. I
made a few remarks about the believers in Weibkin and Kunstadt220,
and shared the story of Mrs. Schwarz and the fact that she used to
say, “I will make the German believers like a magnet, attracting
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to our land.” The Master said:

‘Abdu’l-Bahá came to the pilgrim house and inquired of the status of
the students’ meals. He remarked:

‘Abdu’l-Bahá then asked me, “Any news of your father?” I
replied, “In Germany, I received his letter. He wrote about the
opposition of the Jews of Hamadán, who are in concert with
Muslims and Christians against the Bahá’ís, not accepting them in
businesses or allowing them in the public baths or schools.”

Addressing the honored Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí, the Master
said, “And now the Jews are causing us trouble. Let us wait and see
what happens. Indeed this feast of tribulation is bountiful and
presents all manner of heavenly nourishment. This last one is
needed too. Is it possible that all would mean us harm and the Jews
would refrain?”

The honored Hájí responded, “I have written them (meaning,
the Jews of Hamadán222) that the friends of God must ponder what
they have done that they are no longer confirmed. When there were
only two or three of them, they were triumphant over all others.
Now that they are the majority, they are no longer successful. They
must understand the underlying reasons and find solutions.”

The Master declared, “Whatever we endured must now be
endured by them. Now the Christians and the Jews have arisen in
opposition to us. Initially the Bábís were prepared to be torn into
pieces for their convictions, but now they have no patience for the
slightest guidance. We must deal with them [i.e. the opposition] with
patience. The contentiousness of the Muslim clergy is due to their
fear of losing [the position of] leadership.”

The Hájí said, “During the days of Bahá’u’lláh, wherever the
Muslim divines protested against the Faith, the Blessed Beauty
would say, ‘Give them some food. They want food.’” Smilingly,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá shared:

The late Mírzá Ridá-Qulí had an argument with his
> maternal cousin. The cousin bribed Mírzá Ismá‘íl

of him, I will support you!”

> not say such things and would be more considerate, then
> such disturbances would not occur.”

Today the honored Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí shared a few stories which I
committed in my diary and record below:

First story: Mírzá Mihdí Rashtí was the Iranian Qádí [jurist] in
Constantinople. Previously he had been a friend of the esteemed
Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí, but then had become a dervish though he
never adopted the accessories that this cast is wont to display. After
a time, the honored Hájí said to him, “Our ways are very different,”
and thus each went his own way. Arriving in Constantinople, the
Mushíru’d-Dawlih223 had appointed Mírzá Mihdí the Qádí. Soon
Siyyid Muhammad Isfahání224 befriended him and said, “Previously
everyone drank wine, but in secret. His Holiness the Exalted One
[the Báb] came and discarded all these superstitions and proclaimed
complete liberty. Therefore, should not wine be included among the
allowed ordinances?” Mírzá Mihdí liked this reasoning and therefore
became an Azalí, and was greatly aided by the Azalís. He then sent a
polemic to the Blessed Beauty. Bahá’u’lláh, in the name of Áqá
Muhammad-‘Alí Tanbákú-furush (tobacco trader), revealed a 410-
page reply known as the Kitáb-i Badí‘. All the Azalí objections are
answered therein.

Second Story: Until God manifests a certain attribute, it is hard to
imagine it. But once it is made apparent, its effulgence will emanate
from minds and spirits. It is revealed in the [Persian] Bayan by the
Báb, “You must recognize Man-Yuzhiruhu’lláh225 through your

223 Mírzá Husayn Khán was the Iranian Ambassador to the Ottoman court and at a
later time was appointed the Prime Minister of Násiri’d-Dín Sháh for three years.
224 He was one of the most venomous enemies of Bahá’u’lláh and the main inciter of

Azal. (HM)
225 Lit. Him Whom God will make manifest, a Bayánic term referring to all the

heart, never seeking proof of Him, and immediately accept His
Cause.” Though the Ancient Beauty had privately declared His
Mission in the year nine226, a few of the friends saw in themselves
such spirituality, <120> discernment and attainment that they
proclaimed themselves to be the [awaited] Man-Yuzhiruhu’lláh. [For
example,] Mírzá Músá Qumí in Tafrish declared himself the bearer
of this Office. In his meetings, one side would be served tea and the
other side would drink wine. [Eventually] the inhabitants of Tafrish
raided their homes, plundered their possessions and banished [the
Bábís]. Thereafter, Mírzá Músá declared his intention to proceed to
Baghdad to convert the head of that faction, Jináb-i Bahá227. He
came, attained His presence, and was so transformed that with his
turban and beard, he used to sweep the entrance of [Bahá’u’lláh’s]
house and serve all the friends of God. He was an old man of frail
stature, and when the believers came out of the house, he would
wash their clothing and serve them in many other ways.

Third Story: Nabíl Zarandí came to the Abode of Peace [Baghdad]
to convert the Ancient Beauty, but when he attained His presence,
he was so overwhelmed that he repented. Then he cut his beard and
used it to sweep the entrance of Bahá’u’lláh’s abode. He used to
wear a cotton headdress and serve by the door until the Ancient
Beauty departed for Constantinople. In Adrianople, when [the
Great] Separation took place [between Bahá’u’lláh and Mírzá Yahyá
Azal], Nabíl went to Tihrán and then, each day, proceeded to a
different destination in Iran for [the purpose of] propagating the
Cause.

This afternoon Haifa was engulfed by the fire of separation and

future Manifestations of God.
226 A reference to Bahá’u’lláh’s prophetic experience in October 1852 in the Síyáh-

Chál.
227 Bahá’u’lláh was known in the early years as “the honored Bahá”.

‘Akká illumined by the beauty of the Beloved of the Horizons.
“Sorrow hath enveloped this land, whilst another land rejoiceth.”228

In accordance with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s instruction, a number of us
joined Him in the carriage, went to ‘Akká and remained under His
sacred shadow. In the afternoon, He came to our room, inspected
our situation and arranged for our bedding and other provisions.
The evening meal was taken in His presence.

In ‘Akká, the blessed house [of Bahá’u’lláh] was known as the Bayt
‘Abbúd. The Blessed Beauty spent two years, two months and
eleven days in [the upper chambers of] the city’s Prison. Friends
coming to see Him journeyed for several months. They would tarry
in the surrounding regions of ‘Akká waiting [to see Bahá’u’lláh].
Their sole delight was to behold the Blessed Beauty waving His
hand or handkerchief from the window of His prison cell and
uttering words of greeting. With gladdened spirits, the friends would
then return to their native homes.

After the Ottoman authorities permitted [the Holy Family] to
leave the prison and reside in the city, they changed two or three
homes during a short period of time229 until they were eventually
established on the eastern side of the house of [Ilyás] ‘Abbúd. The
Kitáb-i Aqdas was revealed in an eastern room of this house.230
When the time came for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s wedding, the landlord,

228 Slight modification of the translation in Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 227.
229 After the barracks, Bahá’u’lláh lived in the house of Málik for three months,
house of Mansúr Khavván for a few months, and four more months at the house of
Rábi‘ih.
230 This house belonged to the Christian merchant ‘Udí Khammar. Only later when

this house was joined to the house of ‘Abbúd was the totality referred to as the
house of ‘Abbúd.

‘Abbúd, opened a new entrance connecting the eastern and the
western portions of the house and prepared a special room for
‘Abdu’l-Bahá.231

During the early days, ‘Abbúd was not very happy that his
house was occupied by the Holy Family, but as he witnessed ever-
increasing kindness and consideration, his resentment and enmity
gradually subsided. In later years, he gave the entire western section
of the residence to the Holy Family. In all, the Blessed Beauty lived
in this house for twenty years232. Even when the Blessed Beauty
resided in the Mansion of Mazra‘ih or in the Mansion of Bahjí,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá continued to live in this house and, from this location,
organized the affairs of the Cause.

Today, while pacing in the hallway [of the house of ‘Abbúd],
the Master remarked:

This room was the kitchen. The smoke bothered

> years, the Blessed Beauty resided in this house, and for
> nine years, He did not descend these stairs. It is well

Consider how unfair! The Blessed Beauty always said –

231The marriage of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá took place in late August or early September 1872.
232The last nine years of those twenty years, Bahá’u’lláh resided almost exclusively in
the Mansion of Bahjí. During this period, two of Bahá’u’lláh’s wives and their
children were with Him at Bahjí, while Ásíyih Khánum, known as Navváb, and her
children lived in the House of ‘Abbúd.

That night we all assembled in His blessed room and He sweetened
our soul with heavenly utterances:

233The following version of the incident, based also on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s comments, is
reported by Dr. Zia Baghdadi (Star of the West, 27 September 1918 issue, notes from
27 June 1914): “During the last days in Adrianpole, Agha Djamal and Agha Mírzá
Abdul-Rahim Boroodjerdy, twice came to the Most Holy Threshold. After their first

person, when he left he was transformed.”

28 October 1914, Corresponding to 10 Dhi’l-Hajjih 1332,
‘Íd-i Qurbán234
Early this morning, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá went to the Jamí‘ al-Jazzár
[Mosque of Jazzár], and from there, proceeded directly to the Shrine
of Bahá’u’lláh.

Masjid al-Jazzár

Soon thereafter, His carriage returned, and the honored
Isfandiyár, the carriage driver, informed us of the joyous news that
we had been summoned [to Bahjí]. We immediately proceeded to
the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh.

234 Literally “Feast of Nearness [to God]”. Another name for ‘Íd al-Adhá, the
Islamic “Feast of Sacrifice” of a lamb at the end of the month of pilgrimage.

It was in the flower gardens around the Shrine that the beauty
of the Master illumined our eyes. Indeed, the beauty of the Adored
One had robbed the flowers of their charm! That luminous Person,
with His celestial traits, clothed in a completely white garment, with
white headdress, white shirt and white outer garment, stood out
amidst the multitude of jasmine and multicolored flowers.

As He paced, we entered His presence, bowed down and were
warmly greeted. My God, what immense bounty this is! Are we
asleep or conscious, intoxicated or sober? How truly exalted are the
divine favors bestowed so graciously upon us! How magnificent the
feast spread before us and how profound is such delight! How truly
fortunate we are!

May 1921 in Bahjí’s Garden

With His own hands, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was trimming and pruning
trees and blossoms and tending to the needs of the gardens. The
flowerbeds and fragrant plants on the path had perfumed the air so
profusely as can never be adequately described. The sun shone most
pleasantly. On the horizon, the brilliantly clear sky had embraced the
blue of the sea, creating flawless harmony and accord. The sea was
perfectly clear, transparent and calm, with the blue sky displaying no
clouds or blemishes. The trees perfectly framed the image of our
divine Beloved, and were anyone to behold this portrait that was
indeed a reflection of the high heavens, crazed, enchanted and
bewildered he would cry out in joy and take leave of his senses. O
Lord! My tongue is speechless to adequately thank Thee for Thy
manifold bounties, so plentifully conferred upon us! Praise be to
God! Praise be unto Him!

<125> Soon ‘Abdu’l-Bahá went to the hand-pump and began
to vigorously pump. By our watches, He pumped for nineteen
minutes, and the gardeners used a large quantity of water for the
flowerbeds and trees. It so happened that one of the friends, Áqá
Badí‘ Bushrú’í, kept a close count and informed us that the Master
pumped 361 times, that is, 19 x 19 times.

Previously, there had been no wells at Bahjí. It was very
difficult to water the shrubs, which had only recently been planted
around the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh and regularly required watering.
Early in the evenings, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and some faithful friends would
fill copper buckets with water and placing these on their heads,
would walk from ‘Akká to Bahjí, to water the plants.235 Along the
way, those with melodic voices would chant prayers and
supplications. In the utmost reverence and humility, the beloved
Master, carrying a bucket of water on His head, led the procession.
As He proceeded, He quietly uttered prayers and holy verses until
arrival at the Shrine. This is what they did every night! Eventually, a
well was dug which supplied water to the gardens, and thus the
believers no longer needed to transport water to Bahjí.

It should be noted that carrying water from ‘Akká, which was
the sole means of providing much-needed water to the newly
planted shrubs, also served as a method of protecting the faithful
believers within the fortress of the Covenant. In addition, it
demonstrated sacrifice, selflessness and readiness for martyrdom in
the path of the Blessed Beauty. In the dark of night, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
dressed in white attire, would lead the procession to Bahjí. As such,
He was a target for the enemies as this was at a time when,
exhibiting their full-blown hatred and opposition, the violators of
the Covenant were most active, and constantly watched for
opportunities to harm and injure the Master. While He remained an
easy target, the denizens of the supreme concourse, the dwellers of
the celestial paradise and the angels of the exalted realm above, were
the protectors of the Covenant and did not allow the least harm to

befall ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. They rendered the enemies of the Cause
impotent and defeated, and put fear in the hearts of the violators
and the hypocrites.

In short, after attaining the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, we
followed Him reverently to the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, where we
prostrated ourselves before the sacred Threshold and listened to the
Master chant the Tablet of Visitation with His heavenly and
melodious voice. I must confess that His celestial intonation on that
day has never left me in all these years. O Lord, how inestimable are
Thy bounties and how unworthy and wicked are Thy servants.

Bahjí 1918

We then proceeded to the pilgrim house of Bahjí where a
room next to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s room was given to us. Only a single
wall separated us from Him. A sufrih was spread for the meal, and
unleavened bread was also included. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “Bread is
more important than any other dish. Anything that the body
requires can be found in bread and also in milk. The body needs
elements that are absorbed easily. These are readily available in bread
and milk. If good bread is not available, nothing else will take its
place. Good bread can be eaten with all other things, but stew
cannot be eaten with bad bread. That is why Christ declared, ‘I am

the bread.’236”

At night, after another visit to the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, the
Master spoke in gratitude about the manifold bounties of the
Blessed Beauty and the fact that the invisible hand of destiny had
assembled us all in this resplendent spot. Praised be God, praise be
unto Him!237

Friday, 30 October 1914, the Pilgrim House of Bahjí
Inasmuch as the Mansion of Bahjí was in the possession of the
Covenant-breakers, who exerted every effort, both secretly and
outwardly, to destroy the Cause of God and harm the blessed
person of the Master, the friends avoided meeting and confronting
them to the extent possible. Nevertheless, for the purpose of
ablutions, washing of hands and face, short rests, shaking off the
dust of the journey, praying and drinking tea, the friends tarried in
this spot [the pilgrim house] for a short time. Afterwards, from a
narrow passageway on the western flank of the Shrine, we would
walk to the Point of Adoration of the Supreme Concourse in the
utmost reverence, respect and attention.

This small building (the pilgrim house of Bahjí) connected to
the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh and was comprised of three or four rooms
with a hall situated in the middle of the building. At the rear of the
building, there was a small courtyard. The washroom and kitchen
were on the north side of the building. For now this location serves
as the pilgrim house. Later, we shall see what God decrees.
Undoubtedly, in the near future, the situation will change.238

We spent our days and nights in this pilgrim house under the

236 John 6:35 states, “And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that
cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth in me shall never thirst.”
237 Bushrú’í, pp. 52-3, has a diary entry for 29 October and indicates that it was on

this date that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came to Bahjí.
238 A spacious and modern pilgrim house was constructed under the supervision of

the Universal House of Justice in the 1990s, and presently serves visitors to the
Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh.

shadow of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh and in the proximity of the
room where the Master resided and rested, and where we benefited
from His divine favors. There was only a thin wall between our
room and the Master’s. Every night, we would hear the murmur of
His prayers and the melody of His supplications.

Twice a day, in the mornings and the afternoons, we would
visit the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. The Master would chant the Tablet of
Visitation with such reverence, humility and longing that all who
were present would be profoundly moved. May my life be a sacrifice
for the Master! May it be a ransom to this peerless Servant! He
teaches us the lessons of servitude and modesty, sets the example
for humility and altruism, instructs selflessness and self-annihilation,
proclaims the ways of meekness and consecration, and embodies the
meaning of certitude and worship. He has no desire for praise and
recognition, and only seeks to manifest the true nature of obedience
and love –physically and spiritually, outwardly and inwardly, as an
expression of His very essence. He lived in utter love and absolute
adoration of the Blessed Beauty. Truly, the Ancient Beauty was well
served in such a magnificent Son and such a verdant Branch. And
such a beloved Son well beseemed such a glorious Father! That is,
the Father was to be praised and recognized for such a Son, and the
Son was befitting and worthy of the trust of such a Father! Father
and Son are connected by one sanctified Spirit, and may my soul be
a sacrifice unto Both!

We tarried at this sacred spot for three days and three nights in
the presence of the Friend, away from the commotion of life and
daily routine. Led by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, we frequently attained the honor
of visiting the Shrine, and afterwards spent time in His presence and
enjoyed the feast of His manifold bounties. Both spiritual and
material sustenance were provided. How many among the people of
bygone centuries and ages have prayed, meditated, fasted, longed
and implored to attain unto this Day, and yet perished without
beholding a glimpse. However, undeservedly, the infinite grace of
God surrounded these insignificant servants of His Threshold.
Indeed, we were not worthy of even a small drop of this ocean of

bounty. Whatever we saw, heard or witnessed, was naught but a sign
of His munificence and sovereignty, and an image of heaven above.
Methinks this was paradise, and save for gratitude, my tongue
should hold its peace.

In the course of a meal, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked on an article
[written] by Archibald239:

My purpose is this: others testify that the Cause of
> God is universal, that it contains the reality of all
> religions of the world and will be spread throughout the
> globe. Now consider this testimony by a westerner.
> When a westerner so testifies, it is worth repeating.
> Never will a Christian praise the religion of Islam in this

> Beauty shall penetrate the world of humanity.

<130> 31 October 1914, Bahjí
We woke early and following ablutions and offering supplications
unto the Threshold of the Almighty, Mírzá Ahmad Sohrab and I
walked to the beach and on our return attained the presence of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. His utterances were about His unfaithful kinsmen:

I gave a Tablet to Jamál Effendi240 and instructed
> that traveling through certain cities and following an
> unfrequented route he should reach Qum and deliver the
> Tablet to the Sadr A‘zam [Prime Minister]. He was to

1842\.
240 His given name was Sulaymán Khán.

> his successful mission to Jamal Burújirdí. Jamál and his

> he refused them further audience.241

At lunchtime, the Master noted, “Presently the ravages of war
are unfolding [in Europe], but we are at ease. We are under the
shadow of the protection of the Blessed Beauty.” In the afternoon,
regarding the Ottoman-Russian war, He said, “Constantinople is in
turmoil.” Then He said to this ephemeral servant, “All roads are
closed, especially to Germany. No mail is delivered.”

241 The mission spoken by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá took place in 1898 and the vizier in
question was Mírzá ‘Alí-Asghar Khán, the Amínu’s-Sultán. Two years earlier, at the
time of the assassination of Násiri’d-Dín Sháh in 1896, the Amínu’s-Sultán was the
Grand Vizier. Balyuzi, Bahá’u’lláh King of Glory, p. 393, n.1, states: “It was his
stratagem which saved the day and prevented the outbreak of disorder. Some
modern writers have made the ridiculous suggestion that Amínu’s-Sultán himself
was implicated in the murder of Násiri’d-Dín Sháh.” The Amínu’s-Sultán retired to
Qum after his dismissal by Muzaffari’d-Din Sháh. The fallen Minister had previously
spoken in favor of the oppressed Bahá’ís and Jamál Effendi’s mission was to win his
further sympathy which he initially promised. Once he regained office, however, he
soon forgot his pledge, apparently as result of Jamál Burújirdí’s misbehavior.

Abu Sinan: November 1914

1 November 1914, Bahjí
Today marked the third day that we dwelt under the shadow of the
sacred Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh and partook of both the material and
the spiritual feast of His beneficence. Each morn and eve, we were
blessed with paying homage at the Shrine and enjoying the Visitation
Tablet chanted by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, which enthralled and enchanted
every soul and being.

Twice daily, each time for about twenty minutes, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
pumped water for the trees and plants. This watering of the shrubs
by the Shrine was much the same as nourishing the souls of the
sincere servants of God by the divine teachings and regular reading
of the Writings.

It was two hours after noon when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá suddenly
instructed us to prepare to leave for Abu Sinan. We boarded His
carriage; He sat up front, and the rest of us in the back, as we
proceeded towards Abu Sinan. A gentle breeze passed over Him.
His hair flowed softly over His shoulders, and the scent of His rose-
perfume was delightfully sweet and fragranced the nostrils of us in
the back seat.

The perfume which emanated from that hair,

Was sweeter than the smell of flowers.

En route we stopped at a military camp, and, while we waited
in the carriage, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá went to meet the commander. The
commander had recounted the following to the Master: “There were
seventy thousand of us in the Battle of Sarab, and yet we were
defeated. During our retreat, soldiers would steal each other’s
clothing.” [In sharing this] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá smiled and said, “Witness

their condition!” He then added:

The Blessed Beauty journeyed to the village of
> Yirka three times.242 On the first visit, I walked at the
> side of Bahá’u’lláh’s steed until the proximity of Abu
> Sinan. Those days were marvelously pleasant! Turks have
> a saying, “The memory and reminiscence of those days
are worth the world!”

At one time, after eight or nine years of
> confinement in ‘Akká, [my uncle] the late Mírzá

> countryside was most enchanting, and we immensely
> enjoyed the scenery. There, the late [Mírzá Muhammad-
> Qulí] encountered a friend and inquired about his
> destination. The friend responded, “I am going to Abu
> Sinan and Yirka.” My late [uncle] sighed in sadness, and
> I said to him, “Do not be sad, for one day we shall do
> the same.” Now, every time I visit this village, I think of
> him.

Along the way, wherever we encountered groups of people,
men or women, young or old, they would immediately rise to their
feet and with great humility, would greet the Master. They would
approach Him and kiss His hands with utmost reverence and
affection. In this manner, we made our way to Abu Sinan.

We were guests of Shaykh Sálih243, and on that evening he
organized a large feast in the main hall of his residence, where a

242 Abu Sinan is a village on the eastern side of ‘Akká and the village of Yirka is
situated to the east of Abu Sinan. Most of their inhabitants are Druze and have an
affinity towards the Cause. They are not Bahá’ís, but are devoted to the Center of
the Faith. (HM)

Shaykh Sálih had served in ‘Akká as the Iranian Consul.

number of the friends of God as well as non-Bahá’ís were present.
Speaking on the raging World War ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked:

In these days, wise and sound policies are needed

244 Mírzá Abú’l-Qásim Farahání, the Qá’im-Maqám, (d. 1835) became the Prime
Minister of Fath-‘Alí Shah in 1821 and was one of the ablest statesmen and authors
of modern Iran. He was a close friend of Mírzá Buzurg Núrí, Bahá’u’lláh’s father.
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá have frequently honored him with such expressions as,
“the Prince of the City of Statesmanship and Literary Accomplishment” (Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh,
p. 65.)

Iranians.

When the prince was sent to St. Petersburg, the

Indeed, he showered the prince with his favors.

At the present, the world needs such wise and
prudent men.

Abu Sinan
Day by day, the situation of the war grew worse and intensified.
Correspondingly, the means to acquire daily necessities and
provisions became more difficult and restricted. With the passage of
each day, worries and apprehensions grew more desperate. Power
rested in the hands of a number of ruthless military men who did
not consider themselves accountable to anyone. It was a day of
mayhem and plunder by the Ottoman officials. They caused
difficulties for whomever they chose and destroyed the innocent
with the most meager charges. No one had the least control over his
possessions or life. The government was in the control of a number
of faithless, bloodthirsty and cruel men who were truly the
embodiments of “He doeth whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth
whatsoever He pleaseth.”245 Gallows were active in every town, and
all prominent citizens were eliminated.

245   Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 109; also Gems of Divine Mysteries, p. 62.

It was a time for Pashas to settle accounts with their opponents and
to exact revenge [through hanging]. As soon as the smallest
complaint was raised against anyone, immediately a file would be
prepared for him and his demise was assured. Complete and
absolute power was in the hands of the military commanders, and
not a breath was left of anyone.246

Jamál [Cemal] Páshá was an independent-minded military
commander and a man of truly ruthless character. He would
instantly kill anyone whom he discovered to have a prominent
reputation.

Jamal Pasha and his officers

246 Hasan Balyuzi, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 409 notes: “War had come to Europe, and Turkey
[i.e. Ottoman Empire] was about to commit herself to the cause of the Central
Powers: Germany and Austria-Hungary. Although she had had successive and
decisive defeats in Tripolitania and in the Balkans, within the previous three years,
her rulers, the Young Turks, and particularly the triumvirate of Enver (Anvar)
Pasha, Tal‘at Pasha and Jamál Pasha, forced her into another trial of strength, the
outcome of which must have seemed hazardous and uncertain. By the end of
October 1914 the die had been cast, and in the first week of November, Russia,
Great Britain, and France found themselves obliged to declare war on Turkey, which
was followed on November 14th by Turkey’s declaration of holy war. That
declaration was wrested from the Caliph, Sultan Muhammad V, by the reckless
directors of the destinies of the Ottoman Empire.”

As one of the highest army generals, he had assembled an
enormous force to attack and reduce Egypt and [capture] the Suez
Canal. Tens of thousands of camels were arrayed solely for the
transportation of the army’s water rations. His agents had
confiscated whatever food, clothing, weapons, money, surplus and
stored grains they could find. Thoroughly desolate, the citizens were
left without the most basic provisions as the realm was cleansed of
everything useful for the needs of the military. If anyone protested,
hanging was the immediate response. They would perpetrate
whatever act of tyranny, oppression, injury, calumny, murder,
treachery and sedition that was needed to achieve their end under
the umbrella of the Committee for National Defense.

Taking advantage of this most perilous situation, the spiteful
Covenant-breakers came up with a new way each passing day to
provoke Jamál Páshá against the Faith and further agitate him in this
regard. Sometimes they went to Damascus and provoked the
enemies of the Cause [into action]. At other occasions they sought
the help of Jerusalem, presenting such extravagant gifts as the tent
of the Blessed Beauty, which was the tabernacle of the Most Great
Peace and a precious memento of Bahá’u’lláh’s days. In addition,
they offered whatever sacred [Persian] carpets had remained from

His time.

When giving these gifts, they always registered a complaint
against ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, appearing as the wronged and the victimized.
At times, they depicted ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as a political mischief-maker
and a religious rabble-rouser, thereby sowing seeds of sedition. At
other times, they accused the Master of having designs to inaugurate
a new monarchy and described His communications with the East
and the West as a means for inciting political chaos; or they accused
Him of being a foreign agent. In other instances, the Shrines of
Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb were presented as military forts, and at other
times, as the [new] Mecca and Medina. To confuse and provoke
[Jamál Páshá], they had painted the Greatest Name on a flag and
presented it as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s new “Standard of Monarchy.”

In response, in a meeting of the ‘ulamá in Jerusalem, Jamál
Páshá, being a ruthless and rash man, had promised to slay ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and to level both the Shrines of Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb. This
had greatly excited the Covenant-breakers, giving them courage to
redouble their efforts against the Master.

This time, they submitted another written complaint, outlining
various charges against ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. In this appeal they noted:
‘Previously, every time that the government has tried to adjudicate,
we (i.e. the Covenant-breakers) have also suffered bitterly [in the
process]. Therefore, we now proclaim, loudly and clearly, that we are
not associated with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. [We] ask not to be entangled in
any investigation of Him, and to be left secure in the course of
whatever transpires.’

Clearly, the friends of God needed to avoid troubles during
such a time when the entire Ottoman Empire was in turmoil and
revolution, the government in disorder and unsettled, when blood
was being spilled at every turn, when no accountability or
responsibility was assumed by anyone, and the Covenant-breakers
unceasingly appealed to this ruthless man (Jamál Páshá) for action.

However, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s method was always to make His own
breast the target of His enemies’ darts, thereby shielding the friends
of God from hardships and sufferings. <135> That is, He would

present Himself to danger, to protect the friends from abuse.

Particularly during this perilous period when horizons were
dark with enmity and everyone feared the imminent bombardment
of the port cities, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent every member of the Bahá’í
community of ‘Akká and Haifa in a different direction, far away
from trouble. [During this interval,] He closed the door of
association to all and would neither meet with anyone, nor receive
any correspondence. Of the entire Bahá’í community, only the
Master and a single servant remained in ‘Akká. The honored Hájí
Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí was the sole occupant of the Haifa pilgrim house.
All other believers – men and women, young and old alike – were
sent to Abu Sinan where, for six months, they remained far from the
turmoil. This precaution was particularly necessary since, in addition
to other considerations, it silenced the mouths of the enemies of the
Cause.

For instance, it was said that people were summarily hanged
merely for having had their lights on at night, because they were
suspected of being spies, engaged in preparing reports. As a result,
everyone spent the evenings in total darkness in order not to evoke
the suspicion of the secret police, winning a spot on the hanging
row. The Bahá’í community’s departure for Abu Sinan also allowed
the Master to distance the friends of God from the constant barrage
of rumors about the imminent bombardment of the port cities and
allow them to live in peace and tranquility.

The village of Abu Sinan was a hamlet on the eastern side of
‘Akká, situated on a choice hill, with pleasant and vivifying air and
water. The people cultivated fig and olive trees and grew grapevines.
The inhabitants were mostly Druze, with a few Catholic or Jewish
residents, all of whom were engaged in farming.

The Druze are mostly robust people adapted to mountain life.

Though their religious convictions are not known with any degree of
certainty, they consider themselves monotheistic; that is, they
believed in a single, all-powerful Omnipotent One Who revealed
Himself through His manifestations. [They traced their origin to]
one of these manifestations, al-Hakím, the sixth Caliph of the
Fatimid dynasty [and believed that] at the end of time, when the
world was filled with tyranny and oppression and believers were
surrounded by repression and hardship, then, once more, al-Hakím
would appear and establish justice and equity throughout the world

and his religion would then be triumphant.247 They believed he
would then reassemble the dispersed Druze tribe in Syria and then,
when the standard of his faith was hoisted over Mecca and
Jerusalem, he would bring the whole of the earth under his own rule
and establish justice throughout the realm.

The Druze of Abu Sinan had a particular affinity and
attachment towards the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh and considered
‘Abdu’l-Bahá as one of God’s chosen ones. When one of them fell
ill, they would have him circumambulate the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh
and give the ill one food leftover from the Master’s plate. They
showed great consideration and attraction [to the Bahá’ís]. Since the
old days, all their chiefs and shaykhs had profound affection [for
Bahá’ís], because from the time of the Blessed Beauty they had only
experienced love, sincerity and spirituality. With great devotion and
sincerity, they sought the presence of the Master.

For three months, Bahá’u’lláh had stayed in the village of
Yirka, in the home of Shaykh Marzúq. The sons of the late Shaykh

247 For further details on the Druze history see Moojan Momen, An Introduction to
Shi‘i Islam, p. 55.

[Marzúq], Shaykh Sa‘íd and Shaykh Salmán, had shown great
devotion to Him and dealt with the believers with utmost affection.
They considered Bahá’u’lláh’s room [during His sojourn] as a sacred
shrine, illuminating it each Friday night with a candle. They never
allowed anyone into that room, nor furnished it in any way; and
indeed considered it a sanctified spot. During three months,
Bahá’u’lláh’s tent was pitched in the hills of Yirka.

The house of Shaykh Sálih in Abu Sinan displayed the same
respect, and the Shaykh and his sons eagerly, humbly and warmly
welcomed ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. They considered His presence in their
midst a profound source of bounty, honor and distinction, and His
shadow, the fount of their everlasting happiness and salvation.

2 November 1914, Abu Sinan
This morning, once more, a group of Druze and their chiefs attained
the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Their chief, Shaykh Sálih, was a
sincere old man who considered himself but a servant at the
threshold of the Master. When the Shaykh was expressing his fear of
the war, [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] said [to him]:

You have not experienced genuine difficult times,
> for if you had, such occurrences would not perturb you.
> One night we owned a vast estate and possessed all
> manners of comfort, but in the morning we were evicted
> and deprived of all belongings. Not even a coat was left
> to us. In the midst of the most agonizing cold, we were
> banished from one country to another. I went to my
> mother, asking for some food, but she had none to give.
> I asked for some flour and ate it in place of food. En
> route, in the hope of a good meal, I purchased syrup,
> flour and oil [to make halvah]. Instead, they mistakenly
> added a large quantity of pepper to it, which severely
burned our mouths and insides.
One of our friends was branded seventy times.

> Others had their noses cut off. Yet others were hanged
upside down, until all their intestines fell out.

We have weathered such storms. I pray that
everything goes well and that God will protect all.

At lunchtime, Shaykh Sálih gave a magnificent feast with a
variety of dishes. He had invited fifteen of the Arab chiefs and,
indeed, had exerted much effort for this event. Before lunch, when
all were assembled in the large guestroom of Shaykh Sálih, the
Master stated:

There was a fanatical Protestant minister that
> always wanted to argue. One time he came to Me and
> said, ‘Given His large body and girth, with what kind of
> ladder did Muhammad ascend to heaven?’ I responded,
> ‘With the same ladder that Christ used [to reach

Someone asked about Manes, the Painter250. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
responded:

> Without [the aid of] a compass, he could draw circles.

He did this using two equal, perpendicular lines and like

divine retribution had decreed for him to be subject to an Islamic law.

today.

[Our Residence]
This servant, working as a physician, and Badí‘ Effendi Bushrú’í, as a
teacher, remained in Abu Sinan while the blessed person of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá returned to ‘Akká. Our home was a small, mud-walled room
with a low ceiling and a warped door. When we were cold, we would
light a fire, although the smoke was most bothersome, but opening
the door meant letting in the bitter cold. I treated Bahá’í or non-
Bahá’í patients who came to me251, and in the meantime Badí‘
Effendi taught both boys and girls.

In reality, our room was my dispensary, my office, Badí‘

Effendi’s school and the pilgrim house of the Master. And yet, I can
state unreservedly that never in my entire life had I experienced such
joy and tranquility, nor do I anticipate ever again tasting such
sweetness. The reason was, while the war had deprived us of all
means of comfort, yet our spirits were elated and, falcon-like, soared
to the heavens. Outwardly we were on earth, but in truth we resided
in the pavilions of the Supreme Concourse. Unceasingly we would
chant prayers and, since our room was only seven or eight meters
away, our voices and laughter carried to the next house where the
Holy Family resided. All of our meals were prepared and sent by the
Holy Family and, once or twice a day, we would receive greetings
and words of comfort from the Greatest Holy Leaf.

We were submerged in a sea of bounty and free from all earthy
attachments. However, the news of the War, the worries they
generated and the absence of food and other provisions consumed
people everywhere.

[Bahá’ís of Abu Sinan]
During our sojourn in Abu Sinan we were in the company of the

entire Holy Family and the whole of the Bahá’í communities of
‘Akká and Haifa. Only ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and one or two servants had
remained behind. People were deeply perturbed over the possibility
of bombardment of the port cities, the constant preoccupation with
which had deprived them of a moment’s rest. Consequently,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá had sent all the Bahá’ís to Abu Sinan so that they
would be away from the turmoil.

Moreover, the inhabitants of Abu Sinan and Yirka were Druze
and for years had shown deep affection towards the Faith.
Whenever one of them fell ill, they would take him to
circumambulate the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh and give him a little of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s leftover food. They believed that such remedies
could cure afflictions. Often they [would visit] the Shrine of
Bahá’u’lláh and, having removed their shoes, would enter and pay
their homage. Even in Yirka, they would not allow the room once
occupied by the Blessed Beauty to be used by anyone else, and
would light a candle in there every night, considering it a hallowed
precinct.

Shaykh Sálih was the chief of the Druze and his two sons,
Shaykh Salmán and Shaykh Yúsuf, also ranked among their notables.
Once every few days, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would come to Abu Sinan to
visit the friends and oversee affairs. After a stay of one or two
nights, He would return to ‘Akká.

Pilgrim House of Abu Sinan
Most of the dwellings in the village of Abu Sinan were dilapidated
farmhouses, which the Bahá’ís temporarily rented, with the Holy
Family residing in the home of Shaykh Sálih. Once or twice each
week, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would come and stay for one or two nights. He
would then attend to the needs of the believers, arrange their affairs,
uplift their spirits, <140> and generally give them a new lease on
spiritual life, and thereafter returning to ‘Akká or Haifa.

The Greatest Holy Leaf, the Holy Mother [Munírih Khánum]
and others, such as the American Miss [Edith] Sanderson and Lua

Getsinger (Sitt Lua), were residing in Abu Sinan in the same home.

Lua Getsinger

To keep us from being idle, we (Áqá Badí‘ Bushrú’í and
myself) were given certain duties: Badí‘ Effendi taught the children
and I engaged in the practice of medicine.

Since all the Ottoman physicians were taken to the battlefront
by the military, there was an acute shortage of medical personnel.
Therefore, day and night, this servant was busy performing surgery
and other medical procedures for both the Bahá’ís and non-Bahá’ís.
Often I was taken on horseback to nearby villages to attend to the
sick and do what I could for them. Sometimes the patients would
first go to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, seeking His handwritten instructions for
me to remedy their ills. He would write with His blessed hands:

> Áqá Mírzá Habíb, heal this person.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‘Abbás.

Obedient to His wish, I would then examine the ill person and
treat him with a little medication, and within a short time the person

would always recover. Since no physicians were left in this region
and it was very difficult for the sick to go to Damascus or Beirut [for
treatment], they all came to me, and I always did my utmost to help
[and treat] them.

In addition to practicing regular medicine, I occasionally
performed surgery, during which Lua Getsinger acted as the
anesthetic technician.252 At times, Badí‘ Effendi would help by
providing anesthetics. The wonder of it was that all of these
operations were successful, and I often performed surgeries that I
had never performed before, particularly because I had only recently
completed medical school and did not have much experience, nor
adequate surgical supplies. Nevertheless, the results were most
satisfactory, and everywhere I was known as the “Tabíb-i ‘Abbás
Effendi” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s doctor].

One hundred percent of my practice was successful and never
once did I lose a patient. Despite the lack of medication and proper
instruments, I attempted every necessary procedure and the
Almighty always granted the healing. During every operation, I
whispered prayers and supplicated God for divine assistance:

If Thou wishest me to live

Through me blow Thy holy breath.
The touch of Jesus Thou wilt give

To me, who’ve lain an age in death.253

Indeed, if His grace surrounds us, every undertaking will be
adorned with brilliant success. But if carnal desires motive us, then
naught but loss and regret results. O God, save us all from the evil
of the self!

252 According to Bushru’i, p. 42, Lua Getsinger had arrived in January 1915 from
India and stayed for seven months with the Holy Family, first in Abu Sinan and later
briefly in Haifa.
253 Translation of poem from The Memorials of the Faithful, p. 31.

[Our Room in Abu Sinan]
Our room was at street level and its walls were made from clay
bricks. It was seven or eight meters long and three or four meters
wide and had the same height. The ceiling’s only supports were four
bent and termite-infested beams. The room had a single door and
window. When closed, it was totally dark, and when opened, the
unbearable cold, particularly during cloudy or rainy days, cut through
us. In fact, when it rained, it flooded the room, and we had to find
ways to keep the water out.

There was a spot about two square meters in front of the
entrance that was lower than the rest of the ground. There, several
baskets of dried figs were placed, and through the sale of these our
landlord made his living. That is, our room, in addition to all its
other purposes, including serving as the pilgrim house, was also the
place of business of our landlord!

Even though all the roads were closed and no communication
was possible, we occasionally had two or three visitors, so that, in
total, five or six people lived in our room.

All of our meals were prepared graciously by the Greatest
Holy Leaf with her own hands. Though we lacked basic food
ingredients and people were in dire straits, we had no worries. There
was plenty of bread and most food items were made from groats.
We had an adequate supply of bread, cheese, olives and figs, and
could comfortably live on those. Occasionally, meat would become
available, and the Greatest Holy Leaf would make kabob, which we
would eat with indescribable joy, praising Almighty God. It was
most bewildering that all around us people were dying of bullet
wounds, and yet we enjoyed heavenly nourishment!

At nighttime, we placed the bedding very tightly next to each
other on the floor and, with much difficulty, made enough room for
five or six of us. However, we were so thoroughly filled with joy and
ecstasy that most evenings we only slept two or three hours, or not
at all, particularly during the nights that we had guests. Praise be
unto God! While people on the outside were overwhelmed with
sorrow and grief, had no hope of survival and constantly feared for

their very lives, we in turn were filled with joy and bliss, our spirits
soaring to the heavens, and had no care for the world and its
worries. At all times we sang Bahá’í songs, chanted poems and our
sole yearning was to know when the Master would visit [us again].
As we chanted prayers, our voices would reach the Holy Family:

What use ‘tis at springtime,

To tell a nightingale to remain silent.

It was truly amazing, but all who came to Abu Sinan soon
became like us, carefree. Even when old men came to our pilgrim
house, they would become unconcerned with all else and, like us,
would be filled with joy and delight. In the evenings, as soon as
someone suggested that he was tired and wished to sleep, all others
protested that we should not waste precious hours in slumber, and
considered sleep a manner of loss and regret. Indeed, we devoted
every minute of the evening to chanting and singing.

That bright old man, Hájí Siyyid Javád Yazdí, was the source
of constant amusement and ceaseless laughter. He rolled over the
beddings and made us happy by constant brief jests. At times he
pretended to be a Qur’án reciter and chanted verses [of the Holy
Book] as they would by the gravesites; at other times he raised the
[Islamic] call to prayer in a loud voice; and yet on other occasions he
retold the story of Áqá Zaynu’l-‘Abidín Shikárchí [the hunter] and
prevented us from falling sleep. In short, through various
entertaining acts, he would urge us to stay awake.

In this same pilgrim house, Áqá Badí‘ Bushrú’í, who was
accomplished in the field of education and child development,
conducted daily classes for the Bahá’í children. He exerted his
utmost to properly train the youngsters and was very successful in
his efforts.254 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, “Every time I remember that

254Bushrú’í, p. 37 states that after a short while, a location other than their bedroom
was assigned for the Bahá’í school. Twenty-five students, consisting of children of
the Holy Family, Bahá’í residents and Druze chiefs, were enrolled at the new
location.

in that environment we had such a school, I am exceedingly
overjoyed and praise the Blessed Beauty.”

In reality, this clay room was our pilgrim house, children’s
school, my office, an operating room and also our landlord’s shop
for dried figs – all of these took place in that single room.255

255 Bushrú’í, pp. 55-56, has an entry for 4 November 1914 which indicates that some
remnant Bahá’ís in Haifa came to Abu Sinan and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá left for ‘Akká on this
date. Also, according to Bushrú’í, p. 56, it was during this period that the box
containing Tablets and holy relics were sent to Abu Sinan for safekeeping. Bushrú’í,
pp. 56-57, indicates it was during this time that Prince Shaykhu’r-Ra’ís arrived in the
Holy Land and the Birth of the Báb was observed on 19 November 1914 at Bahjí.
With utmost joy and excitement, all the Bahá’ís residing in Abu Sinan walked to
Bahjí where a feast was given by Áqá Mírzá Siyyid Husayn of Haifa. Twice the
friends visited the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh and before dusk returned to the village of
Abu Sinan. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shaykhu’r-Ra’ís returned to ‘Akká. The following day,
the Birth of Bahá’u’lláh was celebrated in Abu Sinan where 19 Bahá’í children sang
songs and engaged in a period of questions and answers. Bushrú’í, pp. 57-58, has
detailed entries for 21 and 22 November.

Abu Sinan: January 1915

<145> 9 January 1915
Today the land of Abu Sinan was blessed by the footsteps of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. At night, a number of Bahá’ís and certain Arabs
attained the Master’s presence, and all [His] utterances concerned
the situation of the war. He stated:

> This war is indeed ruinous and devastating in its effects.
> However, afterwards, the number of peace-loving people
> will grow considerably, and these commotions, uproars
> and the mighty tumult will precipitate [universal] peace.
> For the West, the most important thing is the war. If
> Germany is victorious, then the Ottoman Empire will be
> triumphant as well. Otherwise, if the Ottoman army
advances into Egyptian territory, it will not be lasting.

May God deal justly with those who caused these
> wars and conflicts which have caused so much
> bloodshed and trouble. Indeed they have undermined
> the prosperity of the people.

10 January 1915
This morning a number of non-Bahá’ís attained the presence of our
heavenly Beloved [in Abu Sinan]. All His utterances were formal and
magisterial. In the afternoon, Shaykh Salmán said to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
“My Guide, my brother Shaykh Yúsuf and I have been discussing a
certain point and as yet, have not arrived at an agreement. My view
is that children must be educated through modern means, whereas
my brother states that most schoolchildren are ill-mannered. From
Your speech it can be concluded that my brother is correct. I say

this because earlier You stated, ‘Druze in this region are better
behaved than the Druze in Lebanon since they are simpler people.’
From this it can be surmised that the more civilized the people, the
greater is their degeneracy.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded:

> It is universally recognized that evil is stronger than
> good. Evil has rapid influence, where good is slow in its
> impact. If a trustworthy person and a thief were
> together, the thief would never become righteous, but
> the converse may occur. Because of their association, a
> truthful person may become a liar, but it is rare for the
> perjurer to become truthful, or for the penurious to
> become generous by reason of his association with the
> charitable, or for the wicked to become virtuous, and so
> forth. This is because evil is stronger and its influence is
> more penetrating. This issue does not require proof, as it
is evident like the sun at noontime.

If there were a thousand healthy men, but one
> among them had a contagious disease, the thousand
> would have no effect on the ill, but the illness of that
> one would spread to the remaining thousand. For
> instance, if a person is afflicted with smallpox and comes
> in contact with many healthy children, all will be
> infected, while it is not possible for the healthy to
> influence the sick. It is similar with the black plague or
> leprosy, where the healthy may be affected, but the
converse would not hold.

but he perishes in an instant by the assassin’s bullet.

Therefore, if you desire for your children to be

There is a story of a Shaykh meeting a Bektashi256

> You stay with me for just one night and all religion will
be forgotten to you!”

Therefore I exhort you to protect your children
from the evil influence of the wayward.

256The Bektashis were the followers of the Bektashiyya Order named after the semi-
legendary Sufi Haji Bektash Khurasani (died circa 1337 CE). The order associated
with the Janissaries until their fall in 1826.

At nighttime, they told us that His blessed person would not come
in to our midst and consequently we began singing hymns and
poems. When we had finished, they gave the glad tidings that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá would come and visit us. That night, He spoke of
European prejudice: “When we arrived at the port of Naples in Italy,
they thought we were Turks and intensified their mistreatment.
Therefore, I told Shoghi Effendi, Mírzá Munír and Kusraw to
return.”257 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá then said to Shaykh Yúsuf:

> Our companions in Europe report that some people
> have been killed there. In France they killed Monsieur
> Bernard nearly a month ago. This person never even
> harmed an ant. He despised war and confrontation so
> much that it is beyond description. He greatly disdained
> even the mention of the word ‘war.’ If there was ever a
> person who truly loved peace, it was he. His contempt
> for war was not because he desired to protect his own
> self, but was due to his hatred of conflict and killing. In
> truth, he was unique in all human perfections and
spiritual attributes. He was a well-wisher to everyone.

One of his philanthropic efforts was that he had
> brought a number of Indian children [to Paris] and
> provided for them to grow and be educated. One of
> them became a doctor, another an engineer and yet
> another a teacher. At the dinner table, there was no
> difference among any of them, and he loved them all like
> his very own. Despite this, he was sent to the battlefront
> and, in the end, was killed. In Europe, the situation is
> such that if a person pays a million lira in ransom, they
> are still not exempt from military service.

257 In 1912, the blessed person of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá journeyed to Europe and America.
Italy was at war with the Ottoman government. Therefore, due to this enmity, they
caused difficulties [for those traveling from Ottoman controlled regions]. Therefore,
certain companions, like the illustrious Shoghi Effendi, Munír Zayn, and Khusraw
Khadím, returned. Dr. Faríd had a hand in this mischief. (HM)

Also yesterday, report was received that another
one of our friends was killed.

Shaykh Yúsuf said, “the Matran258 of ‘Akká was dismissed from
office and all his possessions were confiscated. He is not planning to
stay in ‘Akká any longer.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded:

> Indeed, in Paris he had given talks to five hundred of the
> Ottomans saying that Syrian Christians are oppressed,
> the government is tyrannical and does not grant them
> the least bit of freedom, but the Bahá’ís are free! Each
> year this person (Matran) would go and, on behalf of the
> Syrian Christians, collect large donations, [bringing the
> funds with himself to ‘Akká]. When he saw that this
> melody had receptive ears, and this policy worked, he
> began to give speeches to generous Christians, urging
> them against the Ottoman government and enmity
> towards her. Then the matter was reported in the
> newspapers, and authorities confiscated all his
possessions.

Each year this man would deposit all the funds he
> had collected under various pretexts with the haddad
> [ironworker] and charge interest. At last, the Christians
> learned of the details and protested, ‘You collect funds in
> our name, but instead of spending them on charitable
> ends, you deposit them with Fu’ád Effendi and
> personally benefit from the interest?!’ Indeed, “It is
> evident that God manifests what He has decreed.”

I should explain that I asked Áqá Siyyid Husayn Afnán259 the details

258 Matran (or Metropolitan in Western usage) is a title used in the Assyrian, or
Chaldean Church, designating a rank above archbishop and below patriarch. In the
Western Church, it refers to a rank equivalent to archbishop.
259 Siyyid Husayn Afnán was the older brother of Nayyir Afnán, and both were sons

of Siyyid ‘Alí Afnán, and grandsons of the Blessed Beauty. With ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s

of this Matran, and he wrote the following description in my
notebook:

> The Matran of ‘Akká was one of the entrenched enemies
> of the Faith and a close companion of the arch-
> Covenant-breaker [Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí] and Siyyid
> Mihdí Dahají. He always exerted efforts to sow the seeds
> of doubt and tried to precipitate all kinds of injuries,
> desiring to eradicate the blessed Tree of the Cause. The
> violators of the Covenant had given him most of the
> Tablets260, and he always warned that he had written a
> book of refutation and threatened to perpetrate various
things.

Among his dealings with the arch-Covenant-
> breaker [Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí] was the following
> incident: one time when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had left Haifa for
> Egypt, the arch-Covenant-breaker [Mírzá Muhammad-
> ‘Alí] immediately informed the deposed and despised
> Matran that the Master – and I take refuge unto God! –
> had escaped. At once, the Matran telegraphed a certain
> Christian associate in Jaffa who had gone to the vessel
> [carrying the Master] and inquired [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá],
> “Are You ‘Abbás Effendi?” “Yes, it is I,” was the
> response, “What do you want?” “I had heard of Your
> fame and came to see You,” the Christian replied. After
> returning to Jaffá, one of our friends followed the
> Christian and noted that he had gone directly to the
> telegraph office and cabled the Matran, “The Gentlemen
is on a ship.”

Similarly, in Alexandria, another person came and

financial support, both completed their studies at Beirut College, but satanic
thoughts caused them to leave the straight path of the Cause, to discard their
everlasting crown of glory and to die as violators of the Covenant. (HM)
260 Presumably a reference to the Tablets stolen by Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí on the

night of the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh.

Bahá’s arrival.

The point is that the enemies, together with the

([Written by] Siyyid Husayn Afnán.)

<150> 11 January 1915
In the afternoon ‘Abdu’l-Bahá went to ‘Umqih and returned near
dusk. Praise be unto God that His health was in perfect order and
He often smiled, laughed and shared humorous stories. Shaykh
Salmán said [to the Master], “An order has been issued for a trench
to be dug in Súr and Saydá262 to serve as a defensive measure against
the enemy’s attacks.” Smiling and pointing to Shaykh Sálih, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá said, “They should have taken Shaykh Sálih since, for such
projects, an engineer is needed, particularly an accomplished one.
Therefore, they have erred by not taking Shaykh Sálih. But in truth,
your father is even scared of the sound of trumpets and horns; how
much more the roar of cannons!” [Addressing Shaykh Sálih,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá humorously said,] “How about if you go to the border
and become the army’s commander?” The Shaykh responded, “I
abhor [war]. Even in my sleep I dread such frightening things. Last
night I dreamt that they had fired a cannonball into the village of
Abu Sinan. With much anxiety I awoke immediately.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
stated:

Because you are so frightened, your dreams are also
Qur’án 89:13.

\[261\] 262Súr and Saydá are Tyre and Sidon, two large and important towns in southern
Lebanon.

was the only one left.

> The Imám said to him, “Go forth and fight.”
> “But I have no horse,” he replied.

“Take mine,” the Imám offered. He took the horse and
mounted. Then he complained, “I have no sword.”

“Take mine,” once more the Imám offered.

> Having taken His horse and sword, the man realized that
> it was actually best to escape, so he abandoned the Imám
> standing there with no horse or saber and quickly fled
the area.

When he awoke in the morning, he told this story

> have heard that you had an interesting dream. Pray do
> tell it, as it is amusing.” The man described his dream
> from the beginning to the end. Then the Válí asked,
> “What would you estimate to be the worth of that

Meetings for the recital of the tragedies of Karbalá and the martyrdom of the

\[263\] 
Imám Husayn.

> “At least, four hundred tumáns.”
> “What about the sword?”
“Another three hundred tumáns,” confessed the man.

The Válí ordered the man fined seven hundred

> iniquitous man! Not only did you not aid the Imám, you
> stole His horse and saber! While surely they are more
> precious than this amount, I will let you go with a fine of
seven hundred tumáns.”

Now (addressing Shaykh Sálih), you also always
> speak of war and battle, but in reality you fear even the
> sound of a trumpet, never mind cannons and artilleries!
> However, I had a dream the night before that the
> Páshás264 arrived and told the Bahá’ís of this dream. Is
> this not true? (‘Abdu’l-Bahá inquired of us and we all
bowed down in affirmation.) And my dream was this:

I saw a mighty and straight highway opened up in
> ‘Akká and, at its entrance, a cannon was discharged. All
> the city’s inhabitants, including Myself, leaned to one

and no harm was done.265

I related this dream to My friends, and the
264 A reference to the four members of the Commission of Inquiry who came in
1907 to investigate the Master. For details see Hasan Balyuzi, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, pp. 118-

\[122\] 265 Bushrú’í, p. 10, states that the Commission of Inquiry headed by ‘Árif Bey arrived

at the beginning of the winter of 1907 and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had a dream which He
shared with the friends: “I dreamt that a ship had anchored in the bay of ‘Akká and
several doves that were like dynamite flew from the ship towards ‘Akká. They
circled me as I was standing amongst the deeply frightened citizens and then
returned to the vessel without causing any harm.”

ignore them.266

and implored – indeed even cried in conniving – saying, ‘O my Master, I am
honored to have attained your presence even if briefly. They have come for
investigation, and it is best that you refused to meet them.’ Afterwards, the Valí of
Beirut issued commands, and his vizier, ‘Abdu’r-Rahmán al-Hút, thought the
commission had reduced their indictment and had dismissed charges through some
bribery [on My part]. However, I wrote him, ‘My dearest wish is to be crucified, so
they would subside [in agitation], much like pouring cold water on fire.’” (HM) [This
footnote is given in Arabic and may represent an extract from the memoirs of
someone else, perhaps Dr. Zia Baghdadi.]
267 Hasan Balyuzi, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 120, has understood this to be a reference to

Shaykh Muhammad who was the presiding judge of the Criminal Court.

Bahá’ís of Europe, which, at the instigation of the Covenant-breakers, had attracted
the suspicion of the Ottoman secret police.

spoken by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:

Bushrú’í, p. 12, indicates that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá instructed nine Bahá’ís to consult on this
issue.
274 Lit “red hat.” It became the designation of a section of the Sháh Ismá‘íl’s army

who were of Shí‘í religion and protected the Safavid dynasty. They were called
Qazal-básh because of the red hats they wore and eventually the entire Safavid army
acquired this epithet. By evoking this appellation, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in effect is calling
Himself a soldier in Bahá’u’lláh’s army.
275 “What is promoting my gratitude and thanks to the honored Commission is that

in their charge they have prominently accused Me of being the center of
acclamation, praise and honor, and have attributed great miracles to Me. How can a
prisoner in a strange land, desolate, single and alone manifest such powers that
defeat the influence of mighty governments and be able to inaugurate a new
sovereignty? If he is able to do so, then he deserves the reward. I say, by God, they
have understood incorrectly.” (HM) [Presumably extracted by Dr. Mú’ayyad from
someone else’s Arabic diary.]

276 The viziers had complained to ‘Árif Bey, “Where is this evident standard? Where
is it located?” (HM)
277 Due to the prevalence of spies during [Sultán] ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd’s rule, and various

conniving, intrigues and settlings of personal accounts, one of the Páshás one day,
after drinking wine in a tavern and being intoxicated, had stated the known adage,
“Give me one more glass of wine, O bartender, as every two must become three.”
His meaning was that after two drinks, he wanted a third, but the spies interpreted it
to mean that now that Sultán ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíd and Sultán ‘Abdu’l-Majíd had died,
Sultán ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd would perish as well. This very comment resulted in the death
of that wretched man. (HM)

My great might and power, nay, My ability as a prisoner to cause great miracles! It

him. By God, amazing is their understanding!” (HM) [These words are given in

After this fervent presentation, with an excited visage that was filled
with joy and energy, He arose and left. The influence of this amazing
spectacle indeed would penetrate even a dark stone!

283 Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, pp. 317, notes: “The four members of the ill-fated
Commission of Inquiry, dispatched from Constantinople to seal the fate of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, suffered, each in his turn, a humiliation hardly less drastic than that which they
had planned for Him. ‘Árif Bey, the head of the Commission, seeking stealthily at
midnight to flee from the wrath of the Young Turks, was shot dead by a sentry.
Adham Bey succeeded in escaping to Egypt, but was robbed of his possessions by
his servant on the way, and was in the end compelled to seek financial assistance
from the Bahá’ís of Cairo, a request which was not refused. Later he sought help
from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who immediately directed the believers to present him with a
sum on His behalf, an instruction which they were unable to carry out owing to his
sudden disappearance. Of the other two members, one was exiled to a remote place,
and the other died soon after in abject poverty.”
284 Mírzá Badí‘u’lláh had given a promissory note to [the chief of police] Yahyá Bey

Tábúr Áqásí that if they exiled ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Fízán he would receive 1200 pounds.
[Even though ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was not banished] Tábúr Áqásí received this sum owed
him. (Based on comments of Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí) (HM)

12 January 1915, Abu Sinan
We boarded ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s carriage and went to Haifa to
accompany Miss [Edith] Sanderson for her departure. We stayed in
Haifa on the 13th and 14th [of January].285 We tarried for one more
day after Miss Sanderson’s departure onboard an Italian ship.

[14 January]
At about one hour after noon, we arrived in ‘Akká and came to
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s house. He inquired, “Did Sanderson leave?” We
responded positively. “Praise be to God that she left [safely]. Truly
she is a peerless woman. May she always remain under the
285Bushrú’í, p. 64, has recorded more details on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s utterances on that
day.

protection of the Blessed Beauty.” Then we left for Abu Sinan.

In the course of my medical practice in Abu Sinan, I had
earned thirty bishlak and presented this [to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] with a
request that flour be purchased and distributed among the poor.
This entreaty was graciously accepted, and He instructed the
honored [Druze] Shaykhs to inform the needy of Abu Sinan to
gather that afternoon by the entrance of the residence [of Shaykh
Sálih]. Because of their affection and goodwill, the Shaykhs had
responded, “Out of the benevolence of our Guide, the Effendi
[‘Abdu’l-Bahá], everyone in Abu Sinan has his annual food and
provisions,” and consequently they did not inform the people.

That afternoon none of the poor came, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was
irritated. Angrily, He protested to the Shaykhs, “Every time I want
to give alms, you find some excuse to prevent Me! The good doctor
has raised this money from seeing patients, and now he wishes to
distribute it among the needy. Take it and disburse it between the
Druze and the Christian poor.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá added to my
contribution a sum from His own pocket, and the whole amount
was given to the Catholics.

Praise be unto God that this insignificant gift received the
honor of acceptance at His threshold. And this is naught save by the
grace and the favor of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who rejects the immense
contributions of the affluent, but graciously accepts these most
negligible gifts from the likes of me.

19 January 1915
Today was my birthday.286 In the years past, particularly during the
time that I had been working hard outside the Holy Land on my
studies, I never celebrated my birth. However, this year, having the
incomparable bounty of being under the canopy of the favors of the
Beloved, and partaking of both material and spiritual feast of His
kindness, I thought to mark this day by giving thanks. Though

286   Dr. Mú’ayyad gives his birth date as 19 January 1888.

[because of the war] not a soul in the East or the West was at ease,
we were spending our time here in such marvelous happiness,
drinking our fill from the wine of the Almighty’s love.

Today was a truly festive day. With gifts such as a bottle of
perfume, silk handkerchiefs, sweetmeats and expressions sweeter
than honey, the Greatest Holy Leaf – may my spirit be a sacrifice
unto her bounties – and the blessed Holy Mother converted the
earth of my heart into a mirror of the heaven above!

<160> 22 January 1915
Together with some of the friends we went to the village of Yirka
today. This hamlet is located on top of a hill and has about one
thousand inhabitants who are all Druze. This is one of the sacred
spots sanctified by the footsteps of the Ancient Beauty Who tarried
here for three months. To this day, His blessed room is kept the
same way in the home of Shaykh Sa‘íd and Shaykh Salmán (sons of
the late Shaykh Marzúq), who consider their village hallowed

because at one time it received Bahá’u’lláh, His tent was pitched
there and its soil was blessed by His footsteps. They have the
greatest affection for the friends of God [Bahá’ís] and regard them
in high esteem. As a sign of their great fondness, after having
warmly welcomed us and most affectionately offered hospitality to
our party, they prepared several Arabian horses for our journey back
to Abu Sinan. They even placed several of their servants at our
disposal for this journey.

Except for the original carpets on which He walked, the
honored Shaykhs have placed no other furniture in this room
[occupied by Bahá’u’lláh]. They regard this place as highly sanctified
and light a candle in it every Friday night.

30 January 1915
A number of notables and affluent citizens of ‘Akká came to Abu
Sinan, including, Nazmy Bey Báshí, Alay Amíní, Jawdat Bey,
Yuzbáshí Nazmy Effendi Bey and the city’s physician, Dr. Táhir
Bey. The honored Druze Shaykhs had prepared a dinner feast, and
Badí‘ Effendi and I were invited as well. Before dinner, the guests
had gone to another house and were engaged in drinking wine.

When Áqá Mírzá Tarázu’lláh, son of Áqá Mírzá Mahmúd
Káshí, went to guide the guests to the dinner hall, the ranking
member of these military officers, Bey-báshí Nazmy Effendi had
said to Mírzá Tarázu’lláh, “Today in ‘Akká, a feast was held in front
of the spruce-fir trees.” This feast was organized by Mírzá
Badí‘u’lláh, the violator of the Covenant, who had invited the
military commanders of Haifa and ‘Akká, especially Haydar Bey, the
chief of gendarmes. The guests were entertained with great
quantities of food and [alcoholic] drinks, and then [Mírzá
Badí‘u’lláh] adorned his daughter, Sadhíjih, and sent her in for the
men’s entertainment. His intention was, while they were engaged in
drinking and dance, for her to ask a favor from Haydar Bey that
would result in either imprisonment, exile or murder of the blessed
Person [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. He knew that Haydar Bey and Mahmúd Bey

had complete control over the administration and military forces of
the region. Whatever they did could not be questioned by anyone
else, particularly during the state of war and martial law, which
rendered them thoroughly omnipotent and unrestricted. Therefore
with this sordid scheme, which cost the Covenant-breakers their
worth and chastity, they were trying to attack [the Master]. Alas, they
did not recognize that even if the Holy Ghost materialized and
rebelled against the divine Covenant, it would be lifeless and
impotent [to do so], much less such men who place no value on
their own honor.

Once the news of this feast in ‘Akká had spread, there was a
huge uproar among all the diverse creeds of people saying, “Mírzá
Badí‘u’lláh’s perfidy has deeply disgraced all Iranians, robbed them
of honor and stained them with grievous shame. How is it possible
for someone to attack his own Benefactor in such ways and even be
willing to sacrifice the virtue of his own daughter and wife?
Sanctified be God, what enmity and malice is this?” Openly the
city’s physician, Táhir Bey, would say [regarding the Covenant-
breakers], “Satan must have been incarnated in their human temple
to sow seeds of infidelity.” [He would add about ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,]
“But praise be unto God that a diamond shines amidst all the coal
surrounding it. Good deeds will glow like the brilliant sun and
likewise evil deeds and base conduct will manifest their true
character. From their doings it is now clear why His Holiness
[‘Abbás] Effendi has separated Himself from them and expelled
them from the community. Such incidents must occur so that no
one could be critical of the esteemed Effendi for having severed His
relation with them.”

Sanctified is God! Nonbelievers speak with such clarity of
vision of the ascendancy of the Center of the divine Covenant and
the degeneracy of the enemies of the Cause! Even though Truth
cannot be compared with its opposite, nor the heavens above with
mere soil, thankfully there are those who have perceived the essence
of this situation. “Take ye notice, O men of understanding!” Yea, it
is stated that history repeats itself. In place of the appointed Yúshí‘

ibn Nún they place man-carved idols.

The entire world is seized in the grasp of His [i.e. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s] sovereignty. This is a flawless gem nurtured in the bosom of
the Blessed Perfection. This is a peerless plant watered by the blood
of His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb]. This is a matchless tree
raised by the blood of thousands of martyrs. These clouds of enmity
and hatred can never hope to cover the brilliance of this sun, nor
can this tree be barred from bringing forth everlasting fruits. This is
an impossibility, which the honored gentlemen [i.e. Covenant-
breakers] should recognize.

Abu Sinan: February 1915

7 February 1915
I went to Haifa and in the streets beheld the moon of the orb of the
Covenant.

Haifa 1915

He greeted me with these words, “Marhabá, marhabá! Áqá
Mírzá Habíb, you are welcome. When did you come?” I said that I
had just arrived. “How are the friends?” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá inquired, “I
hope all are happy, delighted, consecrated and joyful.” “By Your
grace,” I responded, “all are well and long for Your arrival.” “I have
some work to do now,” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] said. “Once my work is
completed, then I will come. But I have much to do. What is
happening there?” I informed Him, “Áqá Mírzá Munír [Zayn] had
come and told us that, in case of the arrival of battleships and the

bombardment of the city, the Master had designated a safe haven
for the friends. I have come to retrieve my diplomas.” He
responded, “There are no worries, but I did this so that whenever
there is a difficulty, the friends would know how to deal with such
contingencies, how to prepare for such events so that if they do
transpire, they will not be agitated or confused. The remedy for
illness must be ready beforehand. Because of this, I prepared that
haven. What you are planning to do is very good. Take your
documents with you. Caution must be observed.”

He then went to the home of one of the Turks and assured me
of a second meeting [that day]. Soon, in fact, He returned, and we
boarded His carriage. Áqá Mírzá Ahmad [Sohrab] was also
summoned, and together we went sightseeing. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “I
go to dangerous places by myself, but for sightseeing, I like to take
the friends with Me. Today I want to take you on this excursion. Tell
Me, how do you spend your time in Abu Sinan?” I replied, “By
performing surgeries, and at night responding to polemics and
reading books. I spend the afternoons doing operations and the
evenings outlining [responses to] polemics of [Muhammad-]Javád
Qazvíní. He has translated A‘zam as ‘Great’ and Akbar as ‘the Most
Great’ whereas it should be the reverse.287 (‘Abdu’l-Bahá smiled.)
Among his base accusations is that instead of bringing unity, the
Master separated men from their wives, fathers from sons, and
daughters from their mothers.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “I never caused
their separation. They separated themselves. The Blessed Beauty
established a Covenant and they broke it, therefore, separation took
place. If they obey and remain firm, there will be unity. The Cause of
God has united easterner, westerner, southerner, northerner, Turk,
287It is most likely that the issue had to do with the translation of “Ghusn-i A‘zam”
(the Greater/Greatest Branch, referring to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá) and “Ghusn-i Akbar” (the
Larger or Greater/Greatest Branch, referring to the Covenant-breaker Muhammad-
‘Alí). Both A‘zam and Akbar are strictly speaking comparative, but are often used in
the superlative sense in Arabic. Because Bahá’u’lláh stated in the Book of His
Covenant (His last Will and Testament) that He had chosen Akbar after A‘zam,
Bahá’ís rank A‘zam over Akbar and the former is therefore translated "Most Great"
and the latter “Greater.”

Arab, Indian and American. All are united and would give their lives
for one another. The ones that were far became near; the enemies,
became brothers. But he who violates the Covenant, be it one’s
brother, sister, father or mother, naturally a firm believer will sever
his relations with him.”

I said, “I take refuge with God for saying this, but even if it
was the Master’s fault, then the Blessed Beauty would have done the
same. The very first person that He expelled was His own brother
and His kinsman. Similarly His Holiness Muhammad dealt with
Quraysh in this manner. His Holiness Christ said, ‘I have brought a
sword.’288 He also said, ‘In the latter days, God will separate father
from son and mother from daughter.’289 And ‘He shall separate
them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the
goats.’290 Moreover, [Qazvíní] claims that Badrí [Bedri] Bey was
present, but that the Master instructed the American [visiting] ladies
not to speak French and to say that they did not know that
language.” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] said:

> This is sheer calumny. Badrí Bey was my translator and
> always spoke with them in French. And how is this issue
> related to anything? Repeatedly, I told Mírzá Ahmad
> [Sohrab] not to speak English. This is because of the

288 This is a paraphrase of Matthew 10:34, “Think not that I am come to send peace
on earth; I came not to send peace, but a sword.”
289 Luke 12:53 reads, “The father shall be divided against the son, and the son

against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the
mother; the mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law
against her mother-in-law.”

Badrí291 Bey, who later became Badrí Páshá, was one of the
prisoners of ‘Akká who was extremely bright and well educated.
Frequently he attained the presence [of the Master], and
subsequently he became a believer. One time an English doctor292,
who had his office in the front rooms of the house of ‘Abdu’llah
Páshá, invited the Master to dinner. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to Badrí Bey,
“You come as well, but if you see something that you do not like,
tolerate it and say nothing. These people have peculiar habits.” He
responded, “Whatever is Your will, I will obey.” At the dinner table
that night, all of the doctor’s attention was focused on the well-
ornamented [western] ladies, who were acting like proud peacocks.
He had showered the ladies with his lavish praise and esteem, but
had paid very little attention to His Holiness ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Badrí
Bey. The latter was greatly perturbed and agitated, but the Master
motioned him to remain calm and jovial. The night passed, and
Badrí Bey had a miserable experience.

A few days later, three carriages arrived bringing American
visitors, both men and women. The English doctor came forth
thinking that the visitors had come for him, since typically he had

292This English doctor was with the Church Missionary Society, a British missionary
organization. In 1897, Dr. Cropper was stationed in ‘Akká. The British missionaries
rented the rooms that are to the right of the entrance of the main building of the
House of ‘Abdu’llah Pasha on the ground floor. These are the rooms now used as
the pilgrims’ rest area and dining-room.

western guests. But the Americans told him that they had come to
pay homage to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. A few days later the Americans went
to Bahjí for a visit to the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. They were secretly
followed by the English doctor who saw them prostrating on the
ground and singing such hymns as “Nearer my God to Thee.” Then
they returned to ‘Akká, where they attained the presence of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. Badrí Bey was serving as their translator. The English doctor
came by the door and sent in his business card with a request to
meet the visitors.

The American pilgrims gave the card to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá saying,
“We do not know this person, but will follow whatever You guide.”
The Master responded that this was their decision to make in
accordance with their custom. The Americans said, “When we are
ill, we need a doctor. However, praised be God, since we are now
under Your shadow, we are well and have no need for a doctor.”
They sent the card back, refusing to meet. Badrí Bey announced that
he had then understood the full wisdom of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ways and
gained a deeper appreciation for the majesty of the Faith, and had
become filled with joy.

I said to the Master, “God, verily, doeth what He willeth, and
ordaineth what He pleaseth. The Blessed Beauty has revealed verses
in refutation of such polemics of the violators. His Holiness the
Exalted One [the Báb] has said in one place, ‘David appeared after
His Holiness Moses. And none is permitted to question this
matter.’” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “He has revealed, ‘He appeared
before Moses.’” I said, “Yes, ‘before Moses’ is revealed. I stated it in
error.”293

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s carriage at that point reached the cave of Elijah,
and about two hundred needy women and children were on hand.

293 The Báb refers to David coming before Moses in Dala’il Sab‘ih [The Seven
Proofs], but at least two Azali transcriptions of this work have the order reversed.
Bahá’u’lláh was asked about this and He responded that even though it is contrary to
our understanding of the Qur’an and other Scriptures, that the Báb is the
Manifestation of God and His words are divine wisdom. One of the texts which
refer to this is in Fadil Mázandarání, Amr va Khalq.

The Master said, “Take this money, Isfandiyár294, and distribute it
among them. But do not allow them to receive a second time.”
About one hundred of them were given alms, but the money ran
out. We then boarded the carriage and went about one hundred
steps further when the Master, and His beauteous Countenance, also
boarded. We returned to His residence.

Cave of Elijah on Mount Carmel in 1893

About thirty of the believers were assembled that night in the
house of the Master. He said to the honored Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí,
“Áqá Mírzá Habíbu’lláh cures the ills of all, except he does not
examine Me. Praised be God that out of the favors of the Blessed
Beauty, I am well and healthy. Indeed, I am very well. After such an
arduous journey [to Europe and America], I needed a repose. Now I
am forced to rest a little, otherwise I would not relax. Ustád
Muhammad-‘Alí, chant a prayer!”

294 Isfandiyár was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s coachman and had written this verse above his
carriage, “I am Isfandiyár, servant of the Threshold, assured of Thy favor and
bounty.” (HM)

8 February 1915, Haifa
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was sitting by the entrance, under the sun. Áqá Mírzá
Fadlu’lláh Banán Shírází295 was present as well. The Master said,
“The call of the Supreme Concourse and the fame of the Cause of
God has enveloped the whole earth, but the Iranians have not yet
awakened to it.” A Christian entered, carrying a basket. When he
saw the Master, he was overwhelmed and quickly dropped the
basket, saying, “There was no porter, so I was forced to carry the
basket myself.” “A person must be proud of his labor,” ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá said, “and only ashamed of his sins, not of his work and
service.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Residence in Haifa

A shining cat was sitting next to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and constantly
pressed herself against the Master’s ‘abá. He said, “This cat has such
bliss that none of earth’s monarchs can rival her. She has no fears or
worries and is completely protected and cared for by God!” About
this time, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s gaze fell upon a donkey belonging to the
son of Áqá Nasru’lláh. He said, “It is amazing that in America I did
not see any donkeys. They have zebras, but only in zoos. They are

truly remarkable animals, displaying beautiful stripes. It is marvelous
that in all the museums they have collected various items and kinds
of animals, particularly birds. It takes a month to completely tour the
whole place. Consider how they have tamed wild beasts. They have
caged and trained remarkable lions and spectacular bears; but they
have not been able to edify a single human being! In Paris, at a
certain location, they had caged a polar bear and people would come
and mockingly watch him. The bear would also look back at them
amusingly, probably thinking, ‘What happened that I was seized by
these people? What am I doing here?’” He then laughed.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá at His Residence in Haifa circa 1915

Then, several Ottoman soldiers came and attained the
presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. After a while, they sought permission to
leave and left. The Master said, “At least these Ottomans [make
good soldiers]! I saw several Iranians in Paris. One of them was a
young man and had studied military science for a few years in
France. Afterwards, he had spent a few more years in Germany.
Iranians wanted to enlist him in the war and spoke highly in his
praise, emphasizing the excellence of his education in the military.
When he came to me I tested him and realized that he was

particularly ignorant of the science of war and that the only thing he
was able to take back to Iran was syphilis, which had already
consumed half of his throat. Ottomans are better.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Residence in Haifa

In the afternoon we had tea in the presence of the Master. He
said, “Bring my overcoat so we can walk to the Shrine of the Báb.” I
accompanied Him, and soon a number of other friends joined us.
His carriage was coming from behind. En route, He rested on two
locations and called each the first and the second rest area. On the
way, He asked this servant, “Are you practicing medicine for free?” I
said, “For the needy.” “Do you give them medicine too?” I replied,
“To those who cannot afford it.” We reached a location where the
road bent, and He spoke of the benefit of paved roads. He noted,
“This is indeed an amazing mountain and now has good roads as
well.” (He meant that the large boulders had been removed.)

Hájí Siyyid Javád asked, “Will there be a time when electricity
will be available on this mountain?” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “Without a

doubt! But not so soon. Eventually this mountain will be filled with
light.”

Then we reached a particular location, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said,
“I purchased this parcel of land in order to make the road wider.
The wretched Matran seized it and fenced it with a wall; but he
eventually lost it as well.”

Midway through, His carriage arrived and He boarded. He
spoke most appreciatively of the almond blossom, saying how it had
adorned the mountain. After He chanted the Tablet of Visitation,
we returned. In the pilgrim house He said to the resident believers,
“Plant fruit trees since they are productive. I am very fond of fruit
trees, though I never eat fruits, except an occasional sweet tangerine.
Nevertheless, I love for the tree to bear fruits. Similarly I like people
that produce goodly results. Otherwise it is of no use.”

Shrine of the Báb on Mount Carmel

That night some of the friends were gathered in the house of
the Master when, all of a sudden, the sound of two gunshots was
heard. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said:

The people in this region express their joy by firing
> their guns. One time we were guests in Nahariyya296 and
> they fired their guns so much that eventually I had to
> protest and say, ‘This is not a sign of jubilation. It is
> enough.’ Then the guns became silent. It was like this in
> Iran as well. There would be a huge commotion during
> Naw-Rúz. Indeed, they observed it well. The Europeans
> also observe festivities appropriately, especially
> Christmas. They are joyous and festive, and send gifts or
> congratulatory cards to one another. In short, they

> have not observed it properly. Insha’lláh, this year we
will celebrate it befittingly.

In Iran, rooms are filled with the smoke and the
> filth of cigarettes and water-pipes, which greatly lessens
> the joy of the festivities.

Hájí Siyyid Javád said that people in Egypt use a considerable
amount of tobacco products. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded:

Filth seeks filth. Cleanliness has a profound effect
> on the spirit. Even though cleanliness is related to
> worldly affairs, yet its effect is manifested in the soul.
> Now the Cause of God is not established, but when it is,
> you will see that cleanliness and refinement is one of the

And actually there is no choice but to eat it.

People in this region are relatively cleaner than
Egyptians. Christians, though outwardly cleaner than

The honored Hájí Siyyid Javád said, “The shops that fry
poultry’s hearts and livers are very dirty.” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] remarked:

Unlike the East, chefs in Europe are distinguished

Ustád Muhammad-‘Alí, chant a prayer.

9 February 1915, Haifa
Early in the morning I had tea in the presence of the Master. He
remarked, “Tell the friends to pray that I may soon conclude these
affairs and be able to join them [in Abu Sinan]. I am surrounded
with difficulties; roads are closed and no news reaches Me.
However, unceasingly, glad tidings are pouring forth from the
Supreme Concourse.” I said, “If You are well and in good health,
then the whole world is well.” “Out of the Blessed Beauty’s grace
and bounty,” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “I am well and happy. If
some illness sets, it is superficial and has no lasting effect. It is like
the ocean’s froth: it comes and then disappears. The surface may be
in turmoil, but the depth of the ocean is calm and tranquil. Fí
ámánu’lláh. Go and catch the carriage.”

It was nearly noon when I reached ‘Akká and saw the friends
deeply perturbed and agitated. The violators of the Covenant had
falsely spread the news that the Prince of the Friends [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]
was exiled to Damascus. This news was circulating in ‘Akká; but
when I left ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence and Haifa two or three hours
ago, such a rumor was not heard there. God’s curse be upon the
Covenant-breakers! I feared that this falsity would reach Abu Sinan
and would disturb and upset the Holy Family.

Therefore, despite heavy rains and muddy conditions, I
hastened to Abu Sinan with the utmost speed to refute this rumor.
However, I was late, and this disturbing news had reached there
ahead of me. They thought that perchance after my departure [from
Haifa] this had happened.

Later it became clear that in order to upset and perturb the
friends, the violators of the Covenant had spread such news. “The
hand of God was over their hands!”297 Whatever hole they dig, God will
throw them in the same pit. “Fain would they deceive God and those who
have believed; but they deceive themselves only, and know it not.”298 And “God

shall mock them, and keep them long in their rebellion, wandering in
perplexity.”299

The German Mr. Rothschild300 was a competent artist and had
skillfully drawn a portrait of the Master. He presented this drawing
to Him and asked that a few words be inscribed below the picture so
that a German translation of them would further adorn the portrait.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote:

Man is created in the image of the Merciful [God], with
> spiritual attributes. Therefore, the human temple will perish, but
> his heavenly character will endure. The soul is an effulgence of the
> divine, while the human body is of the earth. Upon thee be the
spiritual attributes.

Illness of the Honored Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí
The pillar of the Covenant, Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí, was among the
last of the teachers of the Faith’s first epoch and faithfully served
until his last breath. He had no thought other than the diffusion of
the heavenly teachings and promotion of the divine Covenant. The
friends of God for the most part are well acquainted with his
heavenly character and spiritual demeanor. His letters, like life-giving
water, are in the hands [of Bahá’ís] in diverse regions. These very
papers and writings testify to his humility, sincerity, knowledge,
wisdom, piety, detachment, sacrifice and the self-abnegation of this
pearl of creation. His politeness, humanity, good-natured discourses,
profound knowledge of Sacred Books, ready mind, witty speech,
and amusing, brief and convincing replies to various questions are
well renowned among all.

Nevertheless, it is inconceivable that one can fully appreciate
and describe his qualities and manifold characters. Indeed the only
way that one can gain insight into his God-given traits of this most
illumined man is to attain his presence and in person behold his
heavenly attributes. His vast quantity of writings include: Dalá’ilu’l-
‘Irfán; Istidlálíyyih Gílán, which is most eloquently composed; a
response to Mírzá Abú-Turáb Badkúbi’í; an autobiography; a
biography of Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl; History of Bahá’í martyrdom in
Yazd; Risálih Leon301; and many more. All of these are potent proofs
of the power of the divine teachings and the influence of the
sanctified Covenant, which recreates people, renews their spirits,
edifies the wayward, causing them to shine everlastingly like brilliant
stars in the heaven of the Faith. The weak is transformed into might,
near-ones and inheritor of the Eternal Kingdom. Indeed, the very
verse, “Most blessed is God, the best of creators”302 is actualized.
Indeed, this is naught save of the bounties of the Exalted One [the
Báb] and of the special character of the manifestation of the
Glorious One [Bahá’u’lláh]. In each age, the eternal robe is placed
on shoulders of certain dejected ones, who are adorned with the
everlasting crown of glory. A fisherman is made the mighty Peter,
Abú-Dharr becomes a great minister, ‘Ammar ibn Yásir turned into
a eminent commander, Abú’l-Fadl Gulpáygání converted into the
celestial Abú’l-Fadl, and this illustrious personage [i.e. Hájí Mírzá
Haydar-‘Alí] is elevated to the height of spirituality and faithfulness.
“And this is naught save divine favor in this Day, decreed by God,
the Generous, the Mighty”.

The honored Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí was more than eighty-
five years old303, but his bright visage, happy disposition, heavenly
smiles, delightful humor and integrity of life suggested he was a
youth in the celestial Kingdom. Moreover, he captivated and
profoundly attracted all who met him. Since my purpose, however,
is to describe the incident of his illness, I will now proceed to
describe that occurrence.
303 Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí was born in 1832.

On 15 February 1915, because of the humidity and the cold,
Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí contracted severe fever and unrelenting
cough. When one of the friends suggested to him that a doctor
should visit, he refused. Instead, he indicated his desire to be
examined by me. On the 17th of February, the honored Afnán
informed ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and instructions were issued for me to leave
for Haifa, which I did on the following day, the eighteenth.

[18 February 1915]
Upon my arrival at the pilgrim house, a number of the friends were
gathered around the Hájí’s bed. As soon as I entered, one of the
friends said to him, “Our own doctor is here!” As the Hájí had no
news of the Master for a few days, he began to cry profusely out of
excitement. Tears poured out from his eyes as he held my hand in
his feverish hand, saying, “You are most welcome, welcome! ‘If the
physician has drunk of the wine of faith, beholding him is the
cure.’304” He cried with such intensity that all around him wept with
a great weeping. After he had calmed down, I examined him and
noted he had pneumonia and a weakened heart. I began treatment
and, for the next six days, remained in Carmel’s Rahmání pilgrim
house attending him. The first night he had a very high fever and
was unconscious; but by the second evening it was reduced and he
was able to speak.

I informed him, “Mírzá Núri’d-Dín [Zayn] is writing a rebuttal
in response to the polemics of the expelled [Muhammad-]Javád
Qazvíní. Since the violators of the Covenant have given up on
misleading the tested believers in the East, now they are
concentrating on sowing seeds of doubts among the western
Bahá’ís. Their intention is to thoroughly uproot these newly planted
trees, and their evil essence has no other concern except

“Merely attaining the presence of the physician who has drunk of the Wine of My

\[304\] 
Love confers healing and his mere breath brings mercy and hope.” Bahá’u’lláh,
Lawh-i-Tibb, Verse VII, line 2, translated by Stephen Lambden.

demoralizing these friends. With satanic character, they seek to
destroy. Even though at the time of the appearance of the sun of the
Covenant, the learned in the Cause and the steadfast friends
responded with brilliance, eloquence and convincing proofs to each
one of these charges, yet divine wisdom dictates that whenever an
illness occurs we must respond to the extent necessary. That is, one
must cleanse an impurity with robbing alcohol and replace a foul
odor with the fragrance of musk. <175> Therefore, during the
evenings we gather and, to the extent of our own understanding,
attempt to write responses so that the American friends are
informed.”

Hájí said, “On my behalf, tell Mírzá Núri’d-Dín that each son
must be better than his father. Therefore he should exert efforts to
bring gladness to the spirit of the honored Zayn[u’l-Muqarrabín] in
the Abhá Kingdom. In my London treatise, I have written that the
Blessed Beauty stated, ‘If it was possible, We would forbid the
friends of God from entering the cities where even a single Azalí
dwelled, since their very breath is a deadly venom.’ Now consider
that the violation of the Báb’s Covenant resulted in such a grievous
statement by the Blessed Beauty. Therefore how dejected and
shameful must be the violators of Bahá’u’lláh’s own Covenant,
particularly in the presence of such irrefutable statements [revealed]
in the Kitáb-i ‘Ahd[í]. Is it not true that in many Tablets Bahá’u’lláh
spoke most condemnatory words of those who violate His
Covenant, stating, ‘Accursed be they in both this world and the
next’? Ponder then how vulgar and indecent are such attacks on the
Covenant!”

[21 February 1915]
By 21 February, Hájí had become well enough that he was able to
bathe. All day he related many sweet and virtuous stories of which
here are three:

First story: Once a king asked his vizier to explain to him, on the
following day, how God is occupied, what He wears and what He
does. Sad and downcast, the vizier came home perplexed as to how
he would be able to answer the king’s questions. Seeing his
condition, his servant said, “Master, tell me your problem, perchance
I can be of some assistance.” The vizier explained the questions
posed by the monarch. The servant replied, “I will tell you two of
the answers now and the third on the day when the robe of honor is
offered. The first answer is that God is occupied with worrying
about His creation. The second is that God wears a sin-covering
robe for His servants.” Armed with these two responses, the vizier
sought the king and presented the answers to the first two questions.
The monarch was absolutely astonished. He said, “These answers
are brilliant and could not have been worked out by you.” The vizier
told him what had happened, so the king immediately summoned
the servant and made him and the vizier switch ranks. As the robe
of honor was being placed on the new vizier, he turned to his old
master and said, “And the answer to the final question as to what
God does: well, He takes from one and bestows it upon another!”

Second story: There was a king who showed great affection and
consideration to his vizier. The vizier consequently felt very close to
him and would show less formality and respect. One time, however,
his servant shared this poem with the vizier and won a handsome
prize:

Though the king may show immense favors,

The minister must know his own place.

Third story: Mírzá Badí‘u’lláh gave a promissory note of twelve
hundred lira to Yahyá Bey, the Damascene, known as Tábur Áqási,
for him to arrange the exile of the Master to Fizan [Fezzan in
Tripolitania].305 However, after their plans fell apart through the
305In a Turkish poem (Ma’idih Asimání , v. 9, pp. 74-76), ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states, “Your
nest is once Iraq, then Rumelia and at another time the fortresses; But the lovers

Almighty’s intervention, Yahyá Bey enforced the payment of the
note. Mírzá Badí‘u’lláh was compelled to sell two pieces of land for
six hundred lira and to sell the ownership of one-third of the
Mansion of Bahjí [to Tábur Áqási] for the remainder of the debt.306
In contra-distinction [to the plotters’ plans], shortly thereafter, with
the utmost majesty, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá traveled to Europe and America
to demonstrate that “God is the best of plotters”.307

22 February 1915, Pilgrim House of Haifa
Because of the coldness of the air and his general weakness, once
again the honored Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí was not feeling well and
even had difficulty turning on his side. As he laid in bed, he was
gently moaning, “Yá ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, yá ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, yá ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá!” Without ever complaining or showing sorrow or pain,
expressions of gratitude and prayers, intermixed with “Yá ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, yá ‘Abdu’l-Bahá!” streamed from his lips. At times, he spoke
of the grandeur of the Cause and told of his own shame for not
having served the Faith in ways more deserving. Tenderly he would
recite the following verses which profoundly effected me, and it
seemed as if a powerful current had passed through my being,
electrifying my entire soul. I leave it to the esteemed reader to
imagine the efficacy of these lines by Sa‘dí as recited by Hájí Mírzá
Haydar-‘Alí from memory:

> A man began to carp at the emperor of Ghazna:
> ‘Ayáz, for a wonder, wants for any beauty:

journey is but from ‘Akká to Fizán.” It may be that this poem was written in 1905
when Sultan Abdulhamid was about to decree His exile to Fizan, after the
investigations of the Commission of Inquiry in the same year.
306 The Guardian purchased one-sixth of the Mansion from the descendents of

Tábur Áqási and it is presently in the possession of the Cause. (HM)
307 Qur’án 8:29. The full verse is: “And call to mind when the unbelievers plotted

against thee, that they might detain thee, or slay thee, or expel thee. Yea, they
plotted; but God plotted likewise. And God is the best of plotters.”

> Yet when a rose wants color and also scent,
> Strange is the nightingale’s melancholy for it!’
> This tale was told by someone to Mahmúd,
> Who much did writhe in his concern:
> ‘My love, good master, is for his nature only,
> Not for his height and goodly stature!’
> I’ve heard that in a defile once a camel
> Fell and smashed a chest of pearls,
> The king cast wide his sleeves that all might share,
> And then drove hence his mount in haste.
> The riders went off after pearls and coral both,
> Scattering from the ruler in search of spoil:
> Of all those neck-lifting henchmen there stayed
> Not one at the king’s nape but Ayáz.

Mahmúd then looked at him and said: “Heart
taker, devious one!

What did you get of spoils?’ He answered:
‘Nothing!

> I was all the while in a gallop at your nape,
> Not neglecting service for the sake of enrichment!’
> If yours be proximity in the hall of audience,
> Ignore not the emperor for robes of honor’s sake
> Such procedure violates the Way, for saints
> Do naught desire of God but God;
> If to your friend’s beneficence you have an eye,
and not to him,

To self you are in bondage, not bound by the
friend.

> So long as your mouth stands open for greed,
> No secret will reach your heart’s ear from the
World Unknown

> Truth is a mansion, all decked out
> Fancy and appetite are but the dust arising
See you not that where dust rises

The sight sees not although a man be sighted?308

23 February 1915
Today, the honored Hájí [Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí] summoned me and
said, “On my behalf go and attain the presence of the Master and
say, ‘I was suppose to die twenty years ago, but You kept me alive.
Now the angel of death is circling my bed and awaits Your
permission. I too am resigned to go and the rest is in Your hands.
We shall do as bidden.”

I left him and together with Áqá Mírzá Jalíl and Áqá Mírzá
Husayn Yazdí went to ‘Akká and came into the presence of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. An Egyptian youth had come from Switzerland and was with
the Master, discussing the World War. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said:

In the loudest voice, I cried in all the synagogues,
> and churches: O people! The world of humanity is in
> peril and Europe is like a barrel of gunpowder waiting
> for a single spark for it to explode. You must endeavor
> to prevent this occurrence. You must protect humanity.
> For six thousand years people have been afflicted with
> ills and prejudices in religious, temporal, national and
> political realms. Have you not discerned that it has come
> to naught? Come, embrace divine politics, that is, the
> politics of love. This is an easy matter. Is it not better for
> us to embrace divine teachings over human conceptions?
> If God was indeed heedless of man, then He would not
> have created him in the first place, provided
> nourishment for him or educated him. Therefore God
loves man.

Similarly, I announce: Religion must be the
promoter of science and civilization. Otherwise, its

> absence is preferable. Why do we have inequality of
> sexes? We all are children of the same father and the
same mother.

Presently, different groups of people in the world

> have drawn lines around it, considering it to be solely
> theirs. They say, “This is my nation and that is yours!”
> On this side of one line is a friend, on the other they see
> an enemy. We behave like dogs, considering a corner of

> approaches our territory, we attack. The only earth that
> belongs to man is the one that will ultimately be poured
> over him. Is it not a waste for so much bloodshed for
this unworthy soil?

When they asked me about the teachings of
Bahá’u’lláh, I would tell them:

At a time when the East was immersed in diverse
> forms of bigotry, when blood flew readily in the streets
> and the world of humanity was surrounded by the
> thickest clouds, at such a time, His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh,
> like the morning star, shone over the horizon of Iran. In
> His dazzling brilliance, all manners of intolerance and
> prejudice disappeared to the point that diverse people
> from the East, West, North, South, Jewish, Christian,
> Muslim, Zoroastrian, all embraced each other with the
> utmost spirituality and fraternity, considering each other
> as members of the same family. They dealt with each
> other with the utmost equity, to the point that when
> someone enters their gathering, they see no difference
whatsoever among all assembled.

Also, among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh are the
> unity of the world of humanity and the establishment of
universal and eternal peace.

28 February 1915
Today ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ennobled the earth of Abu Sinan by His arrival.
In His company were a number of military officers, such as
Kúmándán [commander], Nazmí Bey and Jawdat Bey. In the other
carriage rode Dr. Finkelstein, who was a German and the principal
of the German Polytechnic in Haifa, his sister and three other
Germans.309 <180> As soon as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s carriage came into
view over the horizon, [the Druze] took four horses for the guests
to ride. However, out of deference to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and with His
permission, Kúmándán preferred to walk. However, he insisted that
the Master should ride since it was uphill and difficult for Him.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá mounted a donkey and slowly came from behind,
ordering all others to accompany Kúmándán.

309This school was a German language secondary school in Haifa, and Dr.
Finkelstein was most likely a German Jew. For more details on the school see, Jacob
M. Landau, “Culture, religion and language in Middle Eastern universities”, Judaism,
Issue No. 178, Volume 45, Number 2, Spring 1996.

That night, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke in the gathering [of the
villagers] and I served as the translator. Some of that discussion is
briefly as follows:

‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “How are you? Hopefully the journey from Haifa
did not cause you too much fatigue.”

Dr. Finkelstein: “We are exceedingly happy and joyous that we
have won the bounty of being in the Master’s presence, which is the
ultimate desire of so many people. I too have always longed for a
day such as this and for beholding an assemblage like this.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “Such gatherings are only possible through the
divine bounties and favors. Otherwise, how could the two of us ever
hope to meet? A gathering such as this, in such a location, at a time
when no one draws a breath of comfort, is not possible unless
decreed through God’s benevolence.”’

Dr. [Finkelstein]: “Throughout all of Europe, a meeting similar to
this, with such depth of love and spirituality, is never seen. Even
among the same family members, such affection is not experienced.
We have much to learn from the East, especially, culture, humanity
and spirituality. In its place, we can offer science, technology and
industry.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “Yes, indeed. The relationship between the East and
the West must be like that, otherwise it is of no benefit.”

Dr. [Finkelstein]: “Before this War, the Germans were busy among
themselves and for this reason did not send explorers and seekers to
the various parts of the orient to obtain new perspectives and to
bring them back to our country. However, we hope to do so after
the War and to learn and emulate Your teachings.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “After this War, the minds and understandings [of
people] will have expanded. Peace-lovers and peace-makers will
grow throughout all corners of the globe.”

Dr. [Finkelstein]: “Everyone knows of the evil of war. But peace-
makers are few.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “Everything has its own time and has a prescribed
period. That is, its occurrence is ordained beforehand. Until the pre-
ordained time has arrived, nothing can be achieved. Yesterday I
received a letter from Philadelphia stating that they have increased
the number of Bahá’ís and have assembled and published My talks.
During these days, the promises of the bygone Prophets are being
fulfilled and Isaiah’s prophecy stands manifest.”

> Dr. [Finkelstein]: “This War is the harbinger of universal peace.”
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “It is the greatest instrument of universal peace, its
greatest catalyst. In the course of My journey in the western
countries, in all the synagogues and churches, I cried out that
Europe was in grievous danger. It was like a barrel of gunpowder
that with the least spark would explode and scorch everything in its
grasp. I said to them, ‘People, exert your efforts to protect humanity
from this peril. You have tried all manner of politics, now come try
divine politics. If it does not have desirable results, you can quickly

abandon it and return to your former ways.’ Has anyone seen harm
in affection? What evil is there when the people of the world learn
to love and care for one another as this assemblage does?”

Dr. [Finkelstein]: “This gathering is indeed a brilliant example of
the mighty institutions and momentous movement of ‘Abbás
Effendi which in the future will unite the world. I sincerely hope
that all would embrace these lofty goals.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “Bravo, bravo! This is an effulgence of that
imminent movement which hopefully will soon take place.”

The Master then spoke in Turkish with Kúmándán for some
minutes.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “Where did you journey today and what did you
observe?”

Dr. [Finkelstein]: “Some of the ancient ruins and old synagogues
and cemeteries. If one were to scientifically study the cemeteries, he
would learn a great deal about history, with beneficial results.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “I own some properties in Ghúr310 and ‘Adasíyyih
which contain many ancient artifacts. Insha’lláh, whenever I go to
[Lake] Tiberias311, I will take you as well.”

> Dr. [Finkelstein]: “Very well.”
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “Germans were very kind to us. I am well-pleased
with Germans. The spiritual future of Germany is very glorious. The
word German in Persian means, ‘Our kinsmen!’ I was happier in
Germany than anywhere else.”

Dr. [Finkelstein]: “Presently the relationship between the Ottoman
Empire and Germany is very strong.”

> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “Muslims cherish Germans during such times.”
> Dr. [Finkelstein]: “I hope that the relationship between Iran and
Germany will also grow and become stronger. At the time when our
ancestors in Europe were like beasts of burden, were naked and
covered themselves with sheepskin, Iran enjoyed a tremendous
civilization. It has only been in the past few centuries, that Europe
has experienced such rapid progress. I pray that Germany will bring
310   Better known as Samrah.
311   Sea of Galilee

Iran material progress, and Iran will teach us culture, humanity and
spiritual civilization.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá: “You and Iranians are from the same root, of
Aryan312 descent. Germans and some other European tribes lived on
the shores of the River Ganges. When their number had grown
considerably, they came to Iran. They continued to grow, hence
some went to Caucasia and from there to Europe. However you and
Iranians are from the same branch, and many of your German
words are the same in Persian: for instance, mother, father,
daughter, and some others.”

312   The word Iran means, “the people of Arya.”

Dr. [Finkelstein]: “Yes, indeed, we are of the same branch [of
evolution] and when we want to study many of the German words,
we consider their Sanskrit root.”

At night, the German visitors stayed in Abu Sinan and, on the
following day, had lunch with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. After receiving their
leave, they returned to Haifa. At the time of his departure, Dr.
Finkelstein said to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “These two days in Your august
presence were the sweetest time of my life.” The Master responded,
“I hope you will never forget them and that we have opportunities
for many more conversations. Fí ámánu’lláh.”313

Abu Sinan: March 1915

1 March 1915, Abu Sinan
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s instruction was for me to travel in His carriage to
Haifa and visit Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí, and then to return the
following day. At dusk, I was summoned into His presence for a
meeting, which lasted for about a quarter of an hour. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
spoke about Dr. Finkelstein and other guests, remarking, “Consider
what immense love and devotion governs our relationship and how
devotedly we cherish them. They have no prejudice; they eat
everything, unlike the Jews in this land. The Jews in America have
similar traits and listen attentively.” He then added, “All of our
troubles rest with Áqá Mírzá Habíb. Is it possible that you sustain
everyone’s burden, but not ours? God wanted your efforts of the
past few years not to go to waste; therefore, He provided you this
opportunity of serve. Prepare some [ethyl-carbonate of] quinine for
me. My nerves are tired. My fever is because of My nerves and not
some illness. In Europe they examined Me. It is nothing and only
due to the sustained waves of troubles and tribulations. My nerves
are tired. But out of the grace and bounties of the Blessed Beauty,
My spirit is in the utmost joy and happiness.”

That night in the home of Shaykh Sálih, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
Piety is the mother of all goodly characters, and its

wrote Me, saying, “I have a parcel of land in Haifa that I

Constantinople.

> pious man, as requested, gave him a little money. The
> son sent the appeal to the Caliph, but his response was,
> “Were we to honor such solicitations, soon the treasury

> said to them, “Your father has left a trust with me. If
> you give me one-tenth, that is fine. Otherwise, it is well
> too.” The youth said, “Take two-tenths,” but he took
> only one-tenth and gave the children the money. Soon
> news of this incident reached the Caliph. Mention was
> also made of the bravery and services of the fallen
> soldier. He said, “Since previously his son asked for help,
> it is well if we favor him with a gift of money.” His
> viziers responded, “He is now rich and is no longer in
> need.” The Caliph asked for the details and then
> summoned both the youth and the pious man. He asked
> for both to tell him the story, and then instantly gave the
> key of the treasury to the pious man, rejecting his many
appeals to be excused from this, saying, “I can find none

better than you for this trust.” Thereby he was made the
treasurer of the realm.

One time in ‘Akká, fifty Christians were
imprisoned. Their [Muslim] jailer beat and tortured
them, considering this a meritorious deed before God.
Through various injuries, he would also exact money
from the prisoners and, when they did not pay, beat
them even more severely, claiming, “This is jihad!”
Eventually one of them came to me. I complained to the
governor, “Though the prisoners are Christians, such
treatment is unwarranted. If any Muslim wishes to wage
jihad, let him go to the battlefield and fight against the
Russians. Otherwise, what is the point in beating
defenseless prisoners?!” The governor summoned the
jailer and ordered him to receive fifty beatings by stick.
Eventually the situation of the jailer deteriorated so that
he came to Me, asking for alms for his needy wife and
children. He became a beggar.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Haifa
I was summoned early in the morning into ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence
and had tea with Him. He said, “When you go to Haifa [today], give
My greetings to that Egyptian youth and tell him that his letter was
received. However, for his protection, I will not reply, since they
closely search all the papers. Through divine bounties, without need
for paper and pen, our spiritual communion will be everlasting.” He
added: “I use hyssop. Is it used in modern medicine?” I responded:
“I do not know its chemical composition.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said:

It has a diuretic effect, and therefore it is beneficial.

> Also it is very useful for curing shortage of breath. It has
> an indirect influence. The root of corn316 and the bark of
> cherry are also diuretic. But all healing resides with God.
These are all instruments.

For healing, two causes are necessary: physical and

divine healing are required.

I went to Haifa. Praised be God, Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí was
well and busy telling parables. As a memory of him, I record one of
them in these pages:317

Ayáz was deeply enamored by the character and
> attitude of [Sultán] Mahmúd and was always vigilant and
> conscious not to be overcome with neglect [of his ethical
> duties] and ego, lest riches and rank would conquer him
> and cause him to forget his true self. Therefore, he had
> placed his old, coarse clothes in a satchel and each
> morning and eve would look at them to remind himself
> of his background and roots. In so doing, he continually
> taught himself the lesson of awareness [of the Sultán’s
> generosity.]

317An alternative translation of this story appears in G.S. Davie, Garden of Fragrance,
1882, or A.H. Edwards, 1911, translation by the same title.

The jealous court staffers, who were constantly
> envious of him, considered this affair propitious and
> accused him before the Sultán of embezzlement,
> suggesting that despite the monarch’s unbounded

> a thorough search, his satchel of old clothing was found.
> When Ayáz was asked the purpose of it, he said, “I have
> kept these so I will never forget my beginning.”

> If thou gain renown in the court,
> By this honor don’t become neglectful of the king.
The carriage was ready and I went with it from Haifa to ‘Akká. Badí‘
Effendi and Sháhriyár came as well. We went first to ‘Akká, then to
the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh and then to Abu Sinan. The honored Hájí
Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí had sent a missive to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that was
presented to Him. It read:

> May my life be a sacrifice unto the dust of the feet
of the friends of Your sacred threshold.

An old lamb is not worthy of sacrifice. Praise and
> salutations be unto Your favors that, out of benevolence,
> He accepted my sacrifice and out of sheer munificence,

The servant of the servants of Your threshold,
Haydar-‘Alí.

That night when we attained the blessed presence [of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá], He asked about the Hájí’s health. I reported that, out of
divine bounty, he was well and earlier today was able to leave the
bed. He replied, “‘Glad tidings that God is merciful!’ The honored
Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí is among those who have sacrificed all
possessions in the path of God’s Cause. Even one hour of his life is
precious. When he first came here twenty years ago, he was very ill.
But God preserved him.” I said, “News has been received that the
son of Hájí Mírzá Yahyá Dawlatábádí320 has died.” The Master

“There is no censure in death.” His father caused
much mischief. Wherever I went and won people to the

320Yahyá Dawlatábádí was a son of Hájí Hádí Dawlatábádí and after the passing of
Mírzá Yahyá Azal, successively, both father and son laid claim to leadership of the
Azali community in Iran. Yahyá Dawlatábádí became politically influential and his
three-volume autobiography details much of the political intrigues of modern Iran.
His daughters financed publications of many of the Writings of the Báb.

321Shaykh Salmán wished to meet Azal. The latter had replied, “Come to the hilltop
for a meeting.” When he had come, Azal asked, “How far apart are the telegraph
posts?” At first Shaykh Salmán had thought that by this question Azal was intending
to test him, but then after being with him for a few days he realized that all his talks

Shaykh Yúsuf and Mírzá Tarázu’lláh, son of Mírzá Mahmúd
Káshí, reported, “The governor is preparing for defensive measures
and predicts that warships will bombard the city.” [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]

He therefore left him. (HM)
322 Hádí Dawlatábádí visited Baghdad, most likely during Bahá’u’lláh’s sojourn to

Sulaymáníyyih. Bahá’u’lláh writes of him in Tarázát (Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 43): “O
Hádí! Thou hast not been in Our company, thou art therefore ignorant of the Cause. ... Thou has
been there (Cyprus) and hast seen him (Mírzá Yahyá). Now speak forth with fairness. Do not
misrepresent the matter, neither to thyself nor to the people. Thou art both ignorant and
uninformed.”

In the evening, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came to the home of Shaykh Sálih and
shared the story of ‘Abdu’lláh Páshá:

It was in the middle of the night when they
> informed Me that a local Arab wished to see Me for the
> delivery of a message. When he came in, I recognized
> him as the servant of ‘Abdu’lláh Páshá. He said, “Páshá
> is gravely ill and wishes to see You.” I left immediately
that night and saw that indeed Páshá was in a bad

> situation. With an excuse, he sent his servant out of the
> room and said [to Me], “I have a nephew and a daughter.
> My nephew is an entrenched enemy of mine. My
> daughter lives in Qamran in Yemen, in the midst of the
> tribes of Arabia. I have eighteen hundred Majídí coins
> which I want to bequeath her.” I gave some excuse that
> I had no way of reaching the deserts of Arabia, but he
> said, “I implore You to accept this mission before my
> servant returns. Take this money as I have no means
> other than You.” I took the money and that very night
‘Abdu’lláh Páshá passed away.

The following day I said to the Qádí that the estate
> of ‘Abdu’lláh Páshá must be sold and spent towards his
> funeral expenses. That very day the Qarághúl323 came
> and sold everything and raised a thousand and some
> qurush. There was a certain Ibráhím Effendi who
> wanted to buy the fur coat of the deceased, but I did not
> let him. Later I paid for the coat and gave it to him.
> Repeatedly he said, “O Effendi! We were waiting for his
> day,” but I heeded him not. I then said to the city’s
> treasurer that ‘Abdu’lláh Páshá’s stipend had not been
> paid for several months and asked if it was possible to
> collect it and spend it for his funeral and other of his
> expenses. He replied negatively. I told him to check with
> his accountant who said, “Yes,” and therefore we used
> the back salary of the previous several months for the
funeral.

Subsequently I sent the eighteen hundred Majídís
> with which I had been entrusted to Yemen with Darvísh
> Muhammad-‘Alí. I also sent ‘Abdu’lláh Páshá’s servant
> with him saying that his expenses would be covered, but
> did not tell him of the purpose of journey. I sent a letter
> with Darvísh Muhammad-‘Alí for Muhammad Bey in
323Police Station. (HM) [Perhaps a better definition is “road police”. The Turkish
spelling is Karakol.]

> Yemen to aid in this mission. He helped by appointing
> two porters to direct the Darvísh to Qamran where the
money was given to the orphaned daughter.

At a later date, when ‘Akká’s authorities learned of
> these details, they were annoyed with Me, complaining
> that I had not engaged them in this affair.

The news of the passing of Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rahím was received today,
and, for this purpose, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá left for ‘Akká. He said to me,
“Today I was not feeling well and everyone in the household asked
me not to leave. It is also rainy and very cold, but I want to go to

‘Akká and from there to the resting-place of Áqá ‘Abdu’r-Rahím and
then to Haifa. What do you think?” I said, “Whatever is Your august
will.” He replied, “Confident of the bounties and favors of the
Blessed Beauty, I will go and will complete this journey in good
health. Áqá Mírzá Habíb, you do not know how pleased I am with
you! I am very happy with all your hard labor. Fí amánu’lláh.” He
then left, and with His departure, life seemed to have left me too.

1333 [A.H.]
Praised be God that this year we were able to complete the fast,
particularly since all of our meals were prepared by the blessed hand
of the Greatest Holy Leaf – may my spirit be a sacrifice unto her
favors! And this is due to naught save the grace of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
otherwise we are and will ever be thoroughly unworthy of mention.

O God, my God! Fasting and praying, and indeed all goodly
deeds and charities are conditioned upon Thy acceptance or
rejection. If the deed of an unlearned sinner is accepted before Thy

Threshold in the Kingdom and the Concourse, it stands supreme
over the doings of a thousand pious men and martyrs. And if
conversely, Thou wert to reject the deeds of a worshipper, its effect
can never be told. “Thy acceptance is the greatest of all bounties.”
Therefore, graciously accept this humble deed of Thy servant. Thou
art the Merciful, the Clement, the Bestower.

Today marked the anniversary of the [Báb’s] Declaration and
the Birth of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, which took place in 1260 AH,
[corresponding to] 1844 AD.324 What immense influence will this
year [1844] have on the future of the world and the edification of
humanity! What marvelous discoveries, breathtaking developments
and revolutionizing events are associated with it! What stupendous
prophecies have the Prophets of old uttered about the appearance of
this mighty Day! How many men have, in anticipation of this
Manifestation, worn the white garb of sacrifice, secluded themselves
in mountains or caves, praying fervently and fasting unceasingly for
the early appearance of “the Lord of Hosts”! How many young and
old have sacrificed their all since that year [1844] testifying to its
truth and ascendancy!

In the East, the celebration of the Declaration of the Báb and some other Holy

\[324\] 
Days are observed in accordance with the lunar reckoning.

Prior to noon we left for ‘Akká so that on this blessed Day,
this Holy Day, we would have the bounty of visiting the sanctified
presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Praise be unto God that with the utmost
joy and felicity we received this divine grace and, after paying
homage, returned to Abu Sinan. We had tea with the blessed person
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He inquired about the condition of the ill left in my
care as well as my own health. Then He spoke of the trenches dug
on the shores:

> With these trenches, the Ottoman government thinks
> they can stop armored warships! During the reign of
> [Sultán] ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd [II], when the irregulars decided
> to fight Russia, each soldier was given a gun and two
> hundred bullets. There was a certain Shakír Páshá who
> used to relate, “A number of the ‘ulamá were enlisted
> among the men assigned to my troop. As we left
> Constantinople, they began to fire on every bird, vulture
> or fox that they came upon. No matter how I pleaded
> with them to save their ammunition for the real battle,
> they would not listen and shot everything in sight –
> actually never hitting anything at all! In fact by the time
> we reached the battlefield by the border, all of our
> bullets and powder were consumed. Our mission was to
> ascend a hill on that border location and establish our
> fortifications. But the illustrious ‘ulamá said that they
> would stay down below and refused to climb. Soon
> Russians conquered the hill, established their positions
> and from the higher elevations began to bombard us. I
> said to my men, ‘Let us proceed from the right side and
> gain positions overlooking the Russians.’ But they
> refused, saying, ‘We will stay here.’ Eventually, the
> regular army advanced, defeated and captured the
> Russians. When we returned to Constantinople, the
> command was issued to throw out the incompetent
> irregulars by the butt of our guns! <195> No matter

> how they pleaded, it had no effect, and we threw them
out disgracefully.”

And now, with these ditches, they hope to fend off
huge warships!

Praise be to God that the gates of mercy and favors were flung wide
open, particularly as I was the recipient of the following Tablet
which was the greatest gift of that day. It made my spirit ecstatic and
I take refuge with it whenever I have a difficult medical case.
Through it I supplicate for remedy and healing:

Abu Sinan. The honored Doctor Áqá Mírzá Habíb, upon
him rest the Glory of God, the Most Glorious.

He is God.
O God, my God! I have turned to Thee, supplicating
> bounties from the ocean of Thy healing. O God, enable me to serve
> Thy servants and assist in their healing. Confirm that my medicine
> may be a remedy for every sickness and ailment, infirmity and cold,
> and every other affliction. If Thou wert to refuse confirmation, then
in no wise would my medication be a remedy for illness.

O God, my God! Aid and assist me through Thy healing
grace. Thou art the Healer, the Self-Sufficient, the Remover of

> every adversity and illness. And Thou art, verily, supreme over all
things.

21 March 1915, Naw-Rúz
Today was a historic and wonderful day. All the believers in Abu
Sinan, ‘Akká, Haifa, the Gardens325 and Bahjí were present, and they
numbered about seventy men and undoubtedly the same number of
women.326 What a magnificent day and delightful morning! All
heavenly bounties were arrayed: The grace of beholding the visage
of the Beloved; the visit to the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh; meeting the
friends; the colorful and vivifying flowers; the luscious fruits; the
sweetmeats and confections; the tea; and two cooked lambs which
were purchased on the Master’s instructions. Early in the morning
‘Abdu’l-Bahá came from ‘Akká to Bahjí and in the kitchen prepared
food for the friends. Consider how He teaches humility, service and
sacrifice to His sinful servants who have not inhaled the perfume of
detachment and how the clouds of His bounties shower down the
rain of grace, though naught save motes and specks grow in the soil
of our hearts!

325Ridván and Firdaws Gardens. (HM)
326In conformity with the exigencies of the time, the Bahá’í gatherings in the Holy
Land were conducted separately for men and women until the ministry of Shoghi
Effendi.

After ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had seen to all the work [and supervised
the preparation of food], He joined the gathering of the friends and
instructed that appropriate prayers, Tablets and poems be chanted.
Afterwards, for the occasion of this great festival, these remarks
streamed forth from the Tongue of Grandeur [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]:

Each year the sun has two points of equipoise.

> One commences the season of spring when the year
> enters the zodiac sign of Aries, and its beginning is
> marked by Naw-Rúz. The second brings about the
> season of fall, and the year enters the sign of Libra,
> known as Mihrigán327. During these two times, the sun
> appears in equal portions, dividing the earth into two
> equal hemispheres. The whole of creation, such as
> meadows, orchards, greens and fields are revived and
> renewed in this season, and whatever was dead or
> withering is regenerated and refreshed. What refinement,
> what sweetness, what brilliance and what spirituality are
> attained!

327   Or Mihrján. (HM)

In truth, they observed Naw-Rúz properly in Iran,
and it is evident that the celebration was not just in name
and form. When I was in that land, they would hold
immense festivities, particularly in the villages where all
manners of celebration and joy would be displayed.
Even though presently they have reduced the festivities
somewhat, it is still observed befittingly.

From ancient times, this festival [Naw-Rúz] has
been a source of celebration. After Zahhák’s reign,
Jamshíd came to the Throne on Naw-Rúz. To mark the
joyous occasion, they inaugurated a great [Zoroastrian]
temple and therein raised the sacred fire. Subsequent
monarchs continued with this tradition until it was fully
embraced as the national and state festival. It so
happened that all the means of joy and celebration
would come together on such a day. For instance, if they
were in war, they would be victorious on this day. Every
important undertaking was initiated on the day of Naw-
Rúz. His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb], may My
spirit by sacrificed unto Him, renewed this festival, and
the Blessed Beauty, may my soul be a ransom unto His
friends, established and confirmed it in the Kitáb-i Aqdas.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá at Bahjí

Friday, 26 March 1915
The land of Abu Sinan was once more blessed by the footsteps of
the Moon of the Covenant [‘Abdu'l-Bahá], and one of His talks is
recorded below:

Through the power of the Kingdom, man is saved
> from the grasp of nature by the sanctified Manifestations
> of God and is illumined by the light of divinity. That is,
> he is released from the clutches of the animal world and
> guided to the highest pinnacle of humanity. The state of
> man’s nature is injustice, butchery, tyranny, treachery,
> lechery, achievement of selfish motives, neglect of God
> and fulfillment of carnal desires. The sanctified
> Manifestations of God rescue humanity from this black
> pit and guide them to the highest stations of spirituality.
> Thereupon, man gains faith, attraction to the divine
fragrance, the ability to discover mysteries, divine

> recognition,     knowledge         of     hidden       secrets,
trustworthiness, fidelity, charity, nobility and spirituality.

However, after the passage of time, once more
> man returns to his base nature and is seized in the grasp
> of darkness and unfaithfulness. His original condition is
> reinstated, the bright day is darkened, the world of
> humanity becomes the animal world, splendor is
> transmuted to obscurity, and heavenly attraction turns
> into fulfillment of carnal desires. Indeed, if we were to
> closely consider this, we would see that older societies
> are completely unaware of religion and are captives of
> nature. No sign of divine bounties is discerned, nor is
> any heavenly fragrance inhaled from them. They are
> governed by certain traditions and customs and follow
the ways of their forefathers.

Thus, day is followed by night and the night-
> season overtaken by day. After a period of time, a new
> Dispensation of Reality dawns and divine effulgence
> shine forth from the horizon of truth. Spring then
> becomes summer and then fall and eventually winter.
> After winter, once more, the spiritual spring is born.
This is how divine bounties are propagated forevermore.

Some negligent men think that the spring season
> has concluded and nothing but winter remains. They are
> immersed in their own vain imaginings.

To our regret, today the friends did not attain the presence of the
Beloved. Only when He was departing He passed by our room and
said, “I must go. Do not trouble yourself. Be under God’s care.”
And with that, He left.

28-30 March 1915
An amazing locust attack took place during this period. Like a thick
cloud, they came, blocked the rays of the sun, and when they landed,
were several layers on top of each other. In no time, even the finest
farms were reduced to desolate barren land. No one had ever seen
or heard of similar swarms of locusts in the past.

Today Abu Sinan was blessed by the footsteps of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
Each day until the fifth of April328, the friends attained His august
presence. Most of His talks were about locusts: “Each being has the
right to sustenance. ‘Are they then the distributors of the Lord’s Mercy? It is
we who distribute their subsistence among them in this world’s life.’329 They are
our new guests who have tasted breakfast and now have come for
lunch and dinner. The Arabs in the Arabian Peninsula and Yemen
greatly enjoy the coming of locusts [and capture] and save them for
the future. They say locusts are celestial sustenance, descended from
the heavens above, and they eat and relish them.”

328 As later diary entries indicate, it seems that this stay of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Abu Sinan
lasted until 17 April 1915. However, the diary entries of Badí‘ Bushrú’í suggest that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá may have visited ‘Akká and Haifa for a portion of this period.
329 Qur’án 43:32.

Abu Sinan: April 1915

The Evening of 6 April 1915
Some of the friends and non-Bahá’ís were gathered in the guest-hall
of Shaykh Sálih, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá adorned the assemblage with His
presence. Shaykh Salmán remarked, “Soon Italy will enter the War.”
The Master replied:

So far it is only a rumor. Italy wants to support the
> victor and, whichever direction the wind blows, so will
> Italy’s support. Consider how foolish people are: They
> discard God Who is supreme over all things and follow
> the dictates of subservient mankind. <200> Now they
> say America wants to mediate peace, because in truth
> their Foreign Minster, Mr. Bryan330, does not even want
> the word “war” to be mentioned in his presence. People
> have left God and are attacking one another. They are
> puny and have clung to even weaker beings, whereas
> they should follow God, and be on the side of God!
> They should cling to: “Hand of God is over their
hands.”331

Presently in Europe there is a great deal of rain and
> mud, but by the end of Niysán [spring] and the
> beginning of Ayár332, the great convulsion will begin. All
> of these tribulations are because they have separated
> themselves from the shadow of the Lord’s All-

pro-Allied policies.

Anticipation is in the essence of man. Man is
> always waiting for the future, thinking perchance it might
> be better than today. All the world’s religions are also
> waiting and expectant for a Peacemaker to come and
> repair all affairs.

Shaykh Sálih suggested, “Except for the materialists.” ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá responded:

Even the naturalists [are expectant]. However, their
> expectation is not like the religionists who claim, ‘He will
> come from some unknown city, accompanied with many
> men and arms.’ Instead they maintain that at times
> nature breaks with its pattern and a courageous,
> powerful, peace-loving Man appears Who is a prodigy
> with exceptional foresight and abilities above and
> beyond the normal human beings, and He is able to win
> primacy over others. They maintain that [when
appeared], He would effectively establish universal peace.

The Shi‘ites who follow the Imamate of ‘Alí ibn
Abú-Tálib have certain other convictions. They consider

> ‘Alí sinless and an inspired Imam Who after the Prophet,
> had the highest station and [after Whom] leadership
> resided with His sons and descendents. They claim that
> the twelfth Imam disappeared and now resides in the
> twin cities of Jabulqa and Jabulsa, one in the East and
> the other in the West. Each city has twelve thousand
> gates and the expected Imam spends six months [of the
> year] in each city. He will reappear in the Latter Days,
> when the earth is filled with injustice, wrong, tumult and
> chaos, and will illumine the world with the light of His
> justice and bounties. He will come accompanied by
> unnumbered hosts, will conquer the earth, and enlist all
> the people under His own banner. With His breath, He
will slay the infidels.

There is another faction, known as Kaysaniyya,
> that awaits the reappearance of Muhammad ibn al-
> Hanafiyya, presently living in the Mount Ridva, similar to
> Mount Ridván, who will come in the Latter Day in the
company of a great army and will remedy the world.333

The Sunnis believe that at the end of time and
> from an unknown place, the Mihdí will appear in Mecca
> with a large number of men and hosts and, with His
> sword, will conquer the world and establish His
sovereignty.

The Zoroastrians hold the exact same belief in that

> They only have changed His name and call Him
> Kaykhusraw. In truth, the story is the same even though
> they consider His abode to be an unknown location,
> calling it Mount Unknown334.

333 This faction commenced after the martyrdom of Imam Husayn by a certain
Mukhtar ibn Abu ‘Ubayd ath-Thaqafi, claiming to represent Muhammad ibn al-
Hanafiyya, son of Imam ‘Alí by a Hanafi woman; see Moojan Momen, Introduction to
Shi‘i Islam, pp. 47-49.

The Christians also maintain that His Holiness
> Christ will appear accompanied by a large host of angels
> and for now lives in the heavens, the vast space above.
> Similarly the Jews believe that the promised Messiah
> must be a descendent of Moses and offspring of
> Karshun, and presently resides in the city of Sabbath335,
> surrounded by moving sands, preventing entrance or exit
> from the city. On Saturdays this river of sand stops its

> that at the End of Time, the Promised One will appear
> with a large army, filling the world with justice and
> equity, such that wolf will lie with the sheep, the tiger
with the lamb, and the cobra with the infant.

When a person closely considers these stories it is
> clear that all these expectations are one and the same,
> only differ in the names and locations – but the essence
> is the same.

Shaykh Salmán inquired, “Do the differences stem from the
Founders of Dispensations, or are they attributed to the religious
leaders?” The Master replied:

335   Or the City of Ben Mushih. (HM)

The Founders of religions have not said anything
> that causes differences, but people have vain imaginings
> and follow their own dictates, considering them to be
> the truth. For instance, His Holiness Moses has declared,
> “After Me, will appear another like Me.”336 His Holiness

> will appear.”337 However, the followers of diverse
> religions create confusions, propagate their own
imaginings and cling tightly to these misconceptions.

336 Deuteronomy 18:15 states, “The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet
from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken.”

not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of
error.” Fariq [separator] is closely related to Faraquilit, which is the Arabicised of
Paraclete (Comforter); see John 15:26.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá arrived at the guest-hall of Shaykh Sálih where a
number of non-Bahá’ís were present. The entire conversation
surrounded everyday topics and was in accordance with the aptitude
and interest of the nonbelievers, who had the pleasure of attending.
Regarding people’s fear of the locust attacks, the Master said:

It is amazing that people are afraid of physical
plagues, but have no worries of spiritual calamities. They

John 3:13 states, “And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came

\[339\] 
down from heaven, [even] the Son of man which is in heaven.”

> catastrophes, but do not desire the least harm to come to
> this transient body or be exposed to any jeopardy. They
> say whatever may happen to our soul, let it happen; but
> nothing less than utmost comfort for our body!
It was a rainy day. I returned from Bahjí and twice attained ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s presence in Abu Sinan. The Master stated:

Consider man’s infidelity. With a thousand worries,
> troubles and tears he raises a child. Then, he readily puts
> thousands upon thousands of them to the sword’s blade.
> It takes twenty years for a person to grow to maturity
> and full strength, but in an instant, these people
> massacre tens of thousands of men and allow them to
> perish. How many cities are thoroughly destroyed, how
> many villages are reduced to heaps of dust, how much
> blood reddens the soil and how immense are the
> properties that are plundered and wrecked! And yet,
> there is no benefit in any of this! Their purpose is to be
> victorious. At one time, France was triumphant over

> Germany, and, at another time, the converse stood true.
> None of these victories are lasting and no good will
> come of them, much as they did not benefit them in the
past.

Now, if they were to set aside these acts of carnage
> and butchery, and to deal with one another in accord
> with the divine will, showing love and affection to each
> other, tell me Áqá Mírzá Habíb, is it not better? Consider
> how much trouble it is to cure a single patient, and yet
> these governments slaughter millions and millions.
> <205> Is it not true that you exert great efforts to heal
> just one sick person? Indeed, we save one by one, and
> they annihilate ranks upon ranks.
It was a cold and rainy day, and until about dusk the friends did not
have the bounty of coming into ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence. Early
evening, the Master summoned me and asked of the condition of
the honored Áqá Muhammad-Ibráhím.340 Then He also called forth
to His presence his brother, ‘Abdu’l-Ghaffar, and said:

Know that the Blessed Beauty has explicitly
> commanded consultation with physicians. A person
> must even ask every minute detail from his physician.
> Let me illustrate this point by an example. If we want to
> make a window, we must ask a carpenter, as he is more

and inflicted with pneumonia. His kinsmen would prescribe various remedies and
would not follow my prescriptions. A large number of them would come and visit
him and cause further complications. (HM)

know more about it than others. Therefore you must
follow all details in accord with the instructions of Áqá
Mírzá Habíb [Mú’ayyad] and allow the sick to be cured
through his remedy. And if the ill desires a particular
thing, such as an orange, he must first consult his doctor.
Furthermore, do not allow too many people to frequent
his bedside, and let only a single person remain in the
room to nurse the ill. Let the ill rest. The very air of
tranquility will affect a cure. That is, once calm, serenity
and peace have surrounded the ailing, they will greatly
benefit his condition. Conversely, if many come, each
visitor speaking his opinion, tarrying for a while,
engaging the ill in conversation, then, obviously, he will
be fatigued. There is nothing better than calm and quite.
Moreover, such excessiveness is not conducive for them
either. Consider the gatherings of the Arabs. Rank upon
rank of them come to visit the ill, sit, tell tales, smoke
pipes and other tobacco, to the point that the
atmosphere of the room becomes foul.

Europeans act properly. As soon as one of them is
ill, he is taken to the hospital where visiting is essentially
forbidden. Once every so often the family goes and
inquires about the condition of the loved one from a
receptionist or attendant.

In London, one of the Bahá’ís was ill and, in tears,
some of the other friends came to Me saying that the
ailing person wished to meet with Me. I went to his
hospital but was prevented from visiting. With a great
difficulty, the friends convinced the hospital authorities
that My meeting with him would result in his cure.
Therefore, they allowed Me to enter his room, and God
cured him.

My point is that excessively visiting the ailing has
no benefit. Ensure that others understand this.

I inquired from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá of His health and general
condition, and He stated:

I am well. There is no illness. Only My nerves are
> shattered, and this is because, after Bahá’u’lláh’s
> ascension, I was surrounded with a depression and grief
> that words cannot describe. Now, when I work hard or
> speak extensively, My health is effected. The burdens of
> the recent journey [to Europe and America] ruined My
> health and melted My bones. My feeble temple was not
> able to withstand such difficulties.

I said, “A few days ago when we went to Yirka, it was a most
pleasant and invigorating location. It would seem to be most suitable
for Your well-being if You would go there and rest under its trees.”
‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “Of what use is good health to Me! I want
to wholly sacrifice Myself in the path of the Blessed Beauty and give

no thought to commerce, farming, or possessions. Only through
absolute sacrifice and detachment can one be faithful to the love of
the Ancient Beauty. There should be no other thoughts besides
service to His Threshold. I hope that you will attain unto this
station. The Cause of God is immensely stupendous!”

Áqá Mírzá Tarázu’lláh Káshí said that the violators of the
Covenant had given a feast for Mutasarrif of ‘Akká who was here on
Sunday. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded:

I wish the end of My life to be musk-laden. That is,
> I wish to drink from the chalice of martyrdom in the
> path of the Blessed Beauty. I cherish no other desire
> than this. It would make no difference for Me, for I have
> no comfort to miss or happiness to grieve over. I have
> no joy, so I will not be saddened by its absence, and I
> have no delight to lament over its loss. Whatever
> happens is of no difference to Me. However, these
> people (the Covenant-breakers) exert efforts night and
> day, to cause tumult in ‘Akká. And if there is turmoil in
> that city and it results in My capture, imprisonment and
death, it is of no consequence!

Insha’lláh, they will crucify Me! Or pierce My chest
with a thousand bullets!

However, if there is commotion in ‘Akká, both the
> steadfast believers and they [i.e. the Covenant-breakers]
> will suffer. And that is why in hiding and in secret they
> carry out mischief. Now they have given the tent of the
> Blessed Beauty to this man (Jamal Pasha) when I had not
> allowed a single soul to use it. They gave the rugs of the
> Ancient Beauty to Hasan Effendi, where every night
> wanton women dance on them. In this manner, they deal
> with the relics of their Lord!

They [i.e. the Covenant-breakers] sent Mírzá
> Majdi’d-Dín341 to Jamál Pasha claiming that I am against
> [the Committee for] Union and Progress.342 They
> advanced many calumnies, including: “Whenever there

> entangled with it. Therefore, now, in order to protect

> that it was He [i.e. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] Who committed these

Yahya Bey in Damascus exerted great efforts to

341 A son of Mírzá Musa Kalím and a determined enemy of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
342 The governing body of the Ottoman Empire at that time. The Young Turk
“Committee of Union and Progress” (Ittihad ve Terakki Cemiyeti) or CUP, was
established in 1889 by four young students of the Military Medical Academy in
Istanbul as a secret non-political society against Sultan ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd II. The initial
aim of educating Muslims with Western liberal ideas and culture changed after 1902
when a political program appeared and the radicals took over, who initiated the
1908-1909 Revolution, and the CUP ruled and brought about the disintegration of
the Ottoman Empire between 1908 and 1918. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá highly praised the CUP.
It can be said that He was stating his appreciation for His liberation in 1908 and
before it was clear that the military wing of the CUP had taken over or what that
would mean. It seems that His ties were to the civilian, parliamentarian wing.
Perhaps some of the officials posted to Palestine were Young Turks, with whom he
made contact. (Dr. Necati Alkan, 2004, private communications.)
343 See Mírzá Badí‘u’lláh, An Epistle to the Bahá’í World, translated by Dr. Ameen

Ullah Fareed, Chicago, 1907.
344 Murshid is a term used by mystic to designate their guide and spiritual leader.

Regarding [Lake] Tiberius, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked:

His Holiness Christ spent most of His time on the

Consider how they prostrate themselves on the

> heedless of the Lord of Hosts! Amazing, amazing,
> amazing!
Today ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came to visit the honored Áqá Muhammad-
Ibráhím who was ill in bed. The latter said:

How agreeable if I die,

You come by my grave.
I raise my head from eternal bed,

Crying, “Welcome, O my Beloved!”

In accordance with the Master’s instructions, I began
examining the ill [i.e. Áqá Muhammad-Ibráhím] and subsequently
reported the results to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

Together we then went to the [Bahá’í] school where the
students immediately arose and bowed down. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “It
thrills Me immensely every time I think that in such a village we have
established a school. Please do sit. May God reward your effort.”

That afternoon we went to Bahjí and, in the evening, attended
a gathering in the guest-hall of Shaykh Sálih. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
discourse covered ordinary topics in response to various questions
put to Him by the Shaykhs.
Until about the evening hour we were deprived of the bounty of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence. At nighttime He came to the guest-hall of
Shaykh Sálih and since Ahmad Sohrab had arrived, the Master
inquired: “Áqá Mírzá Ahmad, how long has it been since we left
America?” He responded, “Two and a half years.” <210> ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá continued:

Truly this period has not been productive. At least
> when we were in the America, we were busy and
> constantly met with people and corresponded with the

summary of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s talk which differs considerably from Dr. Mú’ayyad’s
diary.

> My happiness resides in serving the spiritual friends and
> elevating the Word of God. All of these are presently
> absent and, therefore, we are deprived of all bounties.

[Mírzá Ahmad Sohrab] responded, “Insha’lláh after the War,” and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded:

Indeed at that time [in America] every means of
> felicity and blissfulness were prepared. Joy and happiness
> are the cause of cures, and no joy can ever hope to rival
> service to the Cause of God. When a person is truly
> sacrificial, then he thoroughly forgets himself, dedicates
his all in the path of the Blessed Beauty and arises in

> servitude in His love. No exultation and delight can ever
be greater than this.

A person serving the Cause is like a lamp, which

> teach His Cause. The Blessed Beauty did not create and
> educate us for the comfort, the joy and the cares of this
> world. He endured all these trials and tribulations so that
> we would be edified and enlighten the world.

At this point a number of non-Bahá’ís arrived and the
utterances of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá changed from spiritual to conventional
themes. For instance, someone asked when gunpowder was
invented and He responded, “In the Seventh century.” He spoke of
the ways of war in the modern times and praised Arabs for bravery:
“The present war is not a war, it is a deceit. It is bloodshed using
deception and trickery, because all the battles are fought with
equipment and machinery. If battles were still fought with sabers,
then Islam would be victorious over the world. The bravery of
Muslims is legendary. But now man does not fight; all the bloodshed
is through various devices and machines. In the American-Spanish
War not one American was killed. In fact, they warred, and were

even victorious, even though not one of them was injured.”
Afterwards He related the story of Zenubia347, the queen of [the
oasis city] Palymra [Tadmor], as a prime example of bravery.348

The Evening of 12 April 1915, Abu Sinan349
One of the friends said, “From the bounties of the Master’s
teachings, the Iranians in Beirut are submissive.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
responded:

People do not become submissive because of
> virtuous dictums; but rather, when they observe
> righteous deeds, they grow submissive. By God besides
> Whom there is no God, if the friends were to follow the
> teachings and exhortations of the Blessed Beauty, then
> the necks of the kings of the earth would be humbled.

347 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá tells of her story on other occasions; see, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in London, pp.
103-104; and The Promulgation of Universal Peace, pp. 135-136.
348 She was the wife of Odanatus [Odeinats], the governor of Athens. Some forty

years before Christ, Romans had conquered this region and it was under the rule of
the Romans, when Odanatus passed away in the year 266 AD. Since Zenubia was
known for her wisdom, abilities and statesmanship, the Roman parliament
appointed her the governor of the region. Soon she decided to win her
independence and planned on conquering Egypt, Syria and some other parts of
Asia. She raised a fort in Palymra. The ruins are evident to this day. It was sustained
by 69 pillars. She defended her nation for two years from within this castle. With
long hair flowing over her shoulders, wearing the crown of sovereignty and a purple
dress, several times she fought the Romans and was victorious. Eventually Orlian
came to the battle and assumed the command of the Roman armies. After two years,
food ran out in the fort and their farming was insufficient. They ate all the animals
but, after some time, were forced to surrender. Orlian offered to marry her but she
refused, as he had been an adversary at one time. Orlian was angered over this
rejection and decided to belittle her by having circus animals leading the parade
bringing her to Rome, bound by a gold chain. This occurred in 273 CE. Orlian did
not kill her and she spent the rest of her days in a palace with her children. (HM)
349 Bushru’i, p. 63, indicates that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was in Haifa on this occasion and

gives a synopsis of His talk which considerably augments Dr. Mú’ayyad’s diary.

Consider the difference between one who speaks

“Adorn thyself by words, if thou art of the righteous.”

350 Bahá’u’lláh has revealed (Seven Valleys, pp. 8-9): “In this station the lover hath no
thought save the Beloved, and seeketh no refuge save the Friend. At every moment he offereth a
hundred lives in the path of the Loved One, at every step he throweth a thousand heads at the feet of
the Beloved.”

Shaykh Salmán said, “Today the [Newspaper] Azhans
Telegraph reported that in the fort of Berzmesil, which the Russians
had conquered from the Austrians, they only found one cannon.”

When Nadir saw the text of this royal command

Shaykh Salmán remarked, “It is said, ‘Truth is the
deliverance!’351” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá replied:

Yes, indeed. His Holiness (Imam ‘Alí, son of Abí-
> Tálib) was surrounded by enemies and wished to take

> (Salmán, the Persian), “Place me in this basket and carry

head!” In this manner, His Holiness was rescued.

It is said that at the time of Amín and Ma‘mún,

Táhir allowed him into the general camp, assigned

Táhir asked, “What did you see?”

determined the psychological state of the men, and in

will happily return to my own army.”

Táhir was deeply astonished at this man’s veracity

The following Tablet was revealed today [by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá] in honor
of Dr. Bercot352:

He is God!
O thou who art suppliant towards the Presence of the All-
> Merciful, who has humbled herself before His divine Might. I too
> supplicate to the Lord of the Kingdom, He Who possesses all might
> and dominion, that He may make of thee and of thy dear consort
> to become as two signs of concord and unity and that He may bless
> you both in this union to all eternity, and that He may further
> keep you safe in the sanctuary of His protection, and that He may
> cast the glances of His loving kindness and providence upon you.
> Thus may your hearts be gladdened with His hidden bounties, and
> your eyes be solaced with His divine gifts, that His glorious
> rewards, and heavenly blessings ever abide with you both. Upon
you both greetings and praise.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‘Abbás

That night we attained the presence of the Master. His
remarked included, “Greed and avarice are ingrained in human
nature. However divine teachings will change these attributes. The
Prophets and chosen ones have not appeared so that people will
worship them and shower them with praise and laudation. They
have sustained all their trials so that they may guide and educate
people.”
Today ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came by the bedside of Áqá Muhammad-
Ibráhím. Because of his illness, he was not able to talk, but when he
opened his eyes and saw the countenance of the Master, he said,
“How sweet to expire in the arms of the Beloved!”

Soon afterwards he sent Áqá Muhammad-Mihdí to ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and asked permission to leave this nether world. The Master
spoke many expressions of bounties and affection for Áqá

Muhammad-Ibráhím. When the messenger returned to his bedside,
Áqá Muhammad-Ibráhím said, “May I be a ransom for the Master.”
Then thrice he uttered, “Master, Master, Master” and passed on.

Thus after twenty-one days of illness and confinement in bed,
the honored Áqá Muhammad-Ibráhím Mashhadí Fattah left the
world of dust for the celestial abode.353 All during his period of
ailment, this illustrious person spoke prayers and would say
constantly, “O Beloved of the World, O the Great Mystery of God,
O ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‘Abbás!”

There was an amazing scene today. Two warships of the French
armored naval division came into the bay, one towards Haifa and
the other to ‘Akká. At the same time a locust attack, like a dark,
thick cloud descended.354 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “No one has seen
or heard of so many locusts, nor does history record anything like it.
They are the army of God!” He even took the binoculars from me
and surveyed each direction. As we were standing there in deep
thought over locusts, and watching “the army of God”, we suddenly
heard the roar of the cannons of the warships. They succeeded in
destroying the steel bridge between Haifa and ‘Akká.355 In all,
twenty-six shells were fired, of which one of them fell in the Garden
of Firdaws, but did not explode. The people of ‘Akká were greatly
perturbed and worried. Women and children were permitted to
leave [the city], but the men were barred. After an hour, the warships
left and disappeared in the haze of dark smoke.

At that time, the carriage arrived from ‘Akká to take back the
coffin of the honored Áqá Muhammad-Ibráhím to its eternal burial

353 See Memorials of the Faithful 140-1 for a eulogy given by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
354 Today completed the eighteenth day of locust attack. Earth and air was so
densely filled that no one ever recalled a similar incident. (HM)
355 Known as the Bridge of Na‘min. Mírzá Nuri’d-Din Zayn would recall: One day

humorously ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “On the day of creation when God said, ‘Am I
not thy Lord?’ this bridge replied, ‘Yea, yea!’” (HM)

site. The entire village, rank upon rank of Christians, Muslims,
Druze and Bahá’ís gathered, waiting for the arrival of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
Like a luminous moon, He appeared and came forth, bending to lift
a corner of the coffin. A number of the friends rushed forth and
lifted the coffin in His place.

After returning from the funeral procession, many gathered in
the guest-hall of Shaykh Sálih, and the chiefs of the Christians and
Druze gave eloquent talks, praying for the Master’s long life and the
prosperity of the friends.

We were in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for sometime before noon.
Afterwards, He walked around the village of Abu Sinan and since
there was so much talk of locusts and their raid, humorously said to
Shaykh Salih, “Do you not honor the guest? These are your guests.
Imam ‘Alí was fond of three things: ‘fasting in the summer, the blow
of the sword and generosity to one’s guest.’”

At noontime, Kumandan and some others attained the
presence of the Master. In the evening, a number of non-Bahá’ís and
believers were with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the guest-hall of Shaykh Sálih,
and the beauteous countenance of Covenant and Testament spoke
for two hours. Regarding the Egyptian Pyramids He said:

> Harum ar-Rashid wanted to excavate [the Pyramids] but
> was unsuccessful. [His son] Ma‘mun then decided to
> carry out the same task and, after much effort and many
> searches, they found a tablet in the hieroglyphs script.
> There was someone in Europe who could read
> hieroglyphs. Upon the tablet was written the identity of
> the king-builder and the fact that it was so strongly built
> that no one could open it until the end of time. With
this, Ma‘mun discarded his plans.

The Pharaohs raised the Pyramids. Rameses [I]
> built one, the construction of which lasted ten years,
> each day using ten thousand workers. He raised a city of
> six sides, divided into two halves.356 The Palaces of the
> king and the homes of the government chiefs and the
> prominent merchants and some of the poor were on the
> eastern flank with their resting-place on the western side.
> Similarly the [homes of the] chief religious figures and
> places of worship were situated on the western side as
> well. Every king or notable that raised a palace or a
> home would also build a grave [for himself], for they
> believed that the soul would last for as long as the body
> endures. Therefore they discovered a chemical agent that
allowed preservation of bodies.357

Hindus, on the other hand, believe in the exact
> opposite and say that the sooner the body is destroyed,
> the greater the glory of the soul. Consequently, they burn
> their dead.

356For a reference to this store city see Exodus 1:11.
357 One technique was to mummify. However presently the detailed chemical
process of this technique is lost and can be numbered among the forfeited sciences.
When the [Egyptians] mummified, the remains would last for many centuries, never
decaying. Examples of these presently can be seen in various museums. (HM)

Shaykh Yúsuf asked, “How was Heliopolis built?” ‘Abdu’l-

<220> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá then told of the story of Shaykh
Muhammad ‘Abduh and how he had met Him in Beirut and wished
to journey with Him to ‘Akká.360 ‘Abduh had made all his
preparations but ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had prevented him by saying, “It is
not wise for you to come with Me. Moreover it is not sensible for
you.” Then because of his excommunication, the Shaykh had to
return to Egypt from Beirut. [The reason for this expulsion was]
they asked him, “Is it permissible to marry a Christian?” He had
360 Hasan Balyuzi, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p. 38, notes: “In Beirut, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá met, apart
from Midhat Pasha, many of the notables of the Arab world, among them the
celebrated Shaykh Muhammad ‘Abduh, future Grand Mufti of Egypt. This learned
and noble Shaykh had been an associate of Siyyid Jamalu’d-Din al-Afghani, the
standard-bearer of pan-Islamism and an inveterate opponent of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh. Yet so fervent was his admiration for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that he intended to
go to ‘Akká in His company. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá dissuaded him because such action
would have harmed him and his standing.”

answered positively. They also asked him, “Is it sanctioned to wear
European hats?” and he said, “Yes, in warm places.”

Today the honored Mírzá Husayn Yazdí came from Haifa and
attained the presence [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. After inquiring about
certain matters, the Master decided to leave for Haifa. At the time of
bidding the friends farewell, the topics of the war, the onslaught of
the locust, famine and various illnesses were discussed, and He said,
“These tribulations matter not and will pass by. The true calamity is
being far and removed from the divine fragrance.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Haifa in 1913

Haifa: May 1915

5 May 1915, Abu Sinan
The days of our stay in Abu Sinan had come to an end, an
astonishing experience that had passed like a vision. Believers had
now started to return to their homes. Thank God that during these
days of upheavals, storms, trials, tumults, and the associated
vicissitudes of the World War, the friends of God remained safe and
guarded under the canopy of divine favors. They partook of the
evident and heavenly feast of His bounties and remained secure
through His exhortations and guidance. Now that a relative calm
and tranquility had settled in again, the Bahá’ís of ‘Akká and Haifa
were [permitted] to return to their home. Badí‘ Effendi and I too
closed our dispensary and school and proceeded to Haifa. Today,
the two of us carried the box containing the pictures of the Blessed
Perfection and the Primal Point – may my spirit be a sacrifice unto
Them both – to Haifa, the blessed house [of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,] and
conveyed them safely to the Greatest Holy Leaf.361

Were I to give life for this bounty,

it would be fitting.

In the afternoon, we left ‘Akká for Haifa. There, we were
summoned into the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá a few minutes after
our arrival and the Tongue of Grandeur spoke thusly:

Bahiyyih Khánum, surnamed the Greatest Holy Leaf, was the custodian of the

\[361\] 
Holy Relics throughout ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ministry.

I wish for you consecrated service to the Cause of
> God. I wish for you to manifest radiant attributes under
all conditions and to raise the Word of God.

All that you have seen or experienced, all that
> exists in the world of humanity, [is transitory and
> fleeting,] much like a picture reflected on water.
> Consider how many men are engaged most devotedly in
> the present War; how they sacrifice and give their lives
> and possessions; how great is the number of soldiers
> among them. They are commanded by men who have
> dedicated their lives to the study of the science of war.
> They are all ready to sacrifice themselves in an instant.
> And yet their sacrifice has no benefit. [It is transient,] like
> a picture reflected on water. The most they can hope for
> is to have the names of the most prominent among them
> recorded in history, remembered for loving their nation
and sacrificing their lives and possessions for its sake.

However, for those that sacrifice in the path of the
> divine Cause and exert every effort to raise the Word of
> God, their glory is everlasting. It will not change nor be
> forgotten over the passage of time, and their effulgence
will remain ever-resplendent.

A person must exert his very best in every
> undertaking and in all fields of endeavor and must
> employ the means and techniques of that field;
> otherwise, there will be no benefit. For instance, a
> person who arises to diffuse the divine fragrance in the
> path of the Blessed Beauty must be completely detached.
> He must be attracted, sanctified, righteous, itinerant and
> consecrated. Otherwise, the desired results will not be
> wholly achieved. In fact, great efforts may be lost
through the slightest negligence.

I will pray for you and fervently supplicate the
Abhá Kingdom to perfect you in every way.

6 May 1915 – Abu Sinan362
Like a merchant vessel, a large British warship came into the harbor
of Haifa and anchored a mile or two from the shore. She sent an
airplane to survey the nearby military installations, which returned to
the carrier a few minutes later.

We met ‘Abdu’l-Bahá by the orchard of His house. He
inquired from Hájí Muhammad Shushtarí363, “Have you invited the
honored gentlemen364?” “Yes, I have.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked, “With
362  Khátirát Habíb, vol. 1, p. 310 (222), titled this section “Abu Sinan” but most likely
it is a typist error as the described events occurred in Haifa.
363 Hájí Muhammad Shúshtarí was a most sincere, devoted and attracted believer

who was engaged as a patcher. On the occasions that he gained the presence of the
Master, he was singularly and most fondly focused on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, never deviating
his gaze in any other direction. However, he always murmured something. Once
‘Abdu’l-Bahá inquired, “Hájí, what do you whisper?” He replied, “I pray and give
thanks and gratitude for this august bounty.” The Master said, “When you wish to
pray, do so at home.” He responded, “My Master, I do not know why when I see
You, my lips begin to move and pray. I cannot help it. I loose all consciousness.”
(HM)
364 Mírzá Badí‘ Bushrú’í and myself. (HM)

what did you serve them?” “With oranges,” was the reply. The
Master said, “A feast to the love of God is worthy, otherwise there
is no benefit in these everyday invitations and parties. They may
have a temporary effect, but not a lasting one. Oranges are good to
serve and are inexpensive.”

In the afternoon, in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s company and in His
carriage, we went to [the Cave of] Elijah by way of the German
Colony. Since the wind was blowing from the eastern direction, the
Master remarked, “For a few days I wanted to come visit the
countryside but refrained due to the weather. The wind is northerly
and would cause illness. How was the weather in Beirut?”

I replied, “The breeze from the North brought cold fronts, but the
eastern wind impaired health.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “If wind blows over delicate places, such as seas
or orchards, then it is vivifying. But it becomes polluted if it blows
over cities and populated places and may cause illness. The western
wind of Haifa is very pleasant as it comes over the water; the
northern air of Istanbul was agreeable as well.” He then looked at
me and inquired, “You were busy in Abu Sinan. But what do you do
presently?”

“I am not engaged with anything now and await Your direction,” I
replied.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “You can practice medicine here as well. All the
physicians have been taken away and few are left.”

“The ones that have remained are Damascus educated and are not
surgeons.”

The Master inquired, “Is the College365 the same as before or has it
changed?”

> “It is the same curriculum as before with no change.”
> “They have, however, closed the Jesuit school.”
> I replied, “Yes, there were many British- and French-sponsored
schools, but they have been shut. Only the American schools and
the institutions associated with the [American] College are left
functioning.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “It would be very good if the friends of
God would exert efforts to establish a College of Divinity in the
proximity of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh or on Mount Carmel. This
facility can then teach both secular sciences and spiritual topics.”

> “Perhaps the American friends could undertake this effort.”
> “The aspiration of the Eastern friends is greater. A tree that has
deep roots and is firmly established can better withstand the tests of
various winds than those newly-planted ones. The Americans will
become very good, but it will take more time.”

> “We do not have teachers,” I said.

“There is no harm in having non-Bahá’í teachers. Eventually the
[Bahá’í] students will develop and will take their place.”

I said, “The theologians are raising certain issues that are
against rational thought and science.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked:

Spiritual teachings are completely consistent with
> rational thought and science, but it is a question of how
> they are presented. An interpreter is needed. The same
> issue can be presented in multiple ways. For instance, in
365The American College [in Beirut], which later was named the American
University. (HM)

> Europe and America, I never said, “People, the
> Promised One of all ages has appeared. Come and speak
> His praise!” If I had done that, from the very beginning

> ignorance had reached its lowest ebb, at such a time, His

366Shoghi Effendi has echoed a similar teaching method in a number of his writings,
including the following (Guidance for Today and Tomorrow, pp. 232-233):

> They must be neither provocative nor supine, neither fanatical nor
> excessively liberal, in their exposition of the fundamental and
> distinguishing features of their Faith. They must be either wary or
> bold, they must act swiftly or mark time, they must use the direct or

> accordance with the spiritual receptivity of the soul with whom they
> come in contact, whether he be a nobleman or a commoner, a
> northerner or southerner, a layman or a priest, a capitalist or a
> socialist, a statesman or a prince, an artisan or a beggar. In their
> presentation of the Message of Bahá’u’lláh they must neither hesitate

> over stress nor whittle down the truth which they champion, whether
> their hearer belong to royalty, or be a prince of the church, or a
> politician, or a tradesman, or a man in the street. To all alike, high or
low, rich or poor, they must proffer, with open hands, with a radiant

Similarly, [I would explain other themes. For
example,] I would say, “Divine Sovereignty is not limited
to six thousand years, and this world was not created
only six millennia ago. Sovereignty needs an army and a
realm. One cannot maintain that God was there but had
no creation. This is human limitation and not divine.”
<225> Furthermore, I never would tell them that these
honored men [i.e. Bahá’ís] have left their own religion
and have become Bahá’ís. Instead, I would say, “In a
single gathering, Jews, Christians, Muslims and
Zoroastrians are assembled in utmost fraternity and
compassion, like the members of one loving family.”

It is all in how one says something. They say that
Hárún ar-Rashid had a dream that all his teeth had fallen
out. He called forth an interpreter who said, “The
meaning of this dream is that all your children,
descendents and kinsmen will die, and then you will die.”
Hárún ar-Rashid was most disturbed by this comment
and ordered the interpreter imprisoned. He summoned
another dream interpreter and shared the vision with
him. The new interpreter said, “The meaning of this
dream is that Your Majesty will live longer than all
others.” Hearing this, the Caliph was most pleased and
gave him a handsome reward.

You see both interpretations were the same, but
presented differently. Similarly, if spiritual teachings are
also offered in an agreeable way, then they will not cause
setbacks and retribution, nay, they will indeed guide large
multitudes.

heart, with an eloquent tongue, with infinite patience, with
uncompromising loyalty, with great wisdom, with unshakable courage,
the Cup of Salvation at so critical an hour, to the confused, the
hungry, the distraught and fear-stricken multitudes, in the north, in
the west, in the south and in the heart, of that sorely tried continent.

We went a bit further and saw that about two or three
hundred desolate and poor people had congregated, waiting for the
arrival of the Master. He said:

Once divine teachings are diffused, even outwardly
> there will not be any poor or needy left [in the world].
> Presently there are groups organized in America and
> Europe called Socialists. They say, “Why are there so
> many people in need of daily bread when there are
> certain other men with such immense fortunes that they
> cannot even count them? The sweat of the brow of our
> working class has brought about this wealth. This is
> product of the labor of the wretched workers. Why
> should we allow someone to use a business scheme and
> accumulate an enormous estate as a result of the
> suffering of so many destitute workers? All must be
equal.”

It is impossible for all to be equal. If there is no

> His Holiness Moses was perplexed about what to do. A

world’s equilibrium would be perturbed.”

Society is like an army: It requires generals;

> For instance, let every village establish a commonwealth

> expenses into seven:

Incoming:

> 1. One-tenth of the farming [income];
> 2. Zakát367 from livestock and cattle;
> 3. Mines;
> 4. [Buried] treasures;
> 5. [Unclaimed] inheritance;
> 6. Donations;
> 7. Unexpected income, such as objects discovered.

Expenditures:

> 1. One-tenth of income to the central authorities;
> 2. Zakát [to the central government];
367Islamic religious tax, also known as obligatory alms. Kitáb Aqdas, K146, calls for
eventual administration of this tax in the Bahá’í community.

> 3. Expenses for the disabled;
> 4. Orphanages;
5. Welfare for those whose income is less than

> their expenses and who have suffered a loss in
> their possessions;
> 6. Schools;
7. Public health service and general expenses, with

> the residuals being deposited into the public
> treasury.368

Some steps further, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s carriage reached a thriving,
verdant farm that was most productive and green. The wheat plants
waved in the breeze, creating an enchanting scene. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was
jubilant, smiling broadly and radiating joy. He said, “Consider how
delighted the farmer must be to see his efforts have not been in vain
and his seeds have grown into such luscious crop, with full harvest
and free of disease. In like manner, when the divine teachings are
sowed in the field of pure hearts, they bring forth fruits, flowers and
blossoms. They bring an indescribable sweetness to taste.”

368 On 14 August 1912 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gave a talk in Dublin, New Hampshire, which
concerned economics. Subsequently He revealed a Tablet for His hostess, Mrs.
Agnes Parsons, which outlined His previous talk. In this Tablet He revealed, “In
every village a council of wise men of the village should be established, and the whole village should
be placed under its jurisdiction. In addition, a public treasury should be established with its own
administrators. At harvest time, a specific quantity of the general produce of the village should be
appropriated for the treasury. This treasury will have seven sources of income, namely: tithes; taxes
on livestock; unclaimed inheritance; property that has been found but that has no owner; buried
treasures (if found, one third of it should be paid to the council); mines (one third of the natural
resources taken should be levied by the council) and donations. Likewise, there are to be seven
categories of expenditures: first, moderate public expenditures such as the expenses of the council and
maintenance of public health; second, payment of government taxes; third, payment of taxes on
livestock to the government; fourth, care of orphans; fifth, providing for the disabled; sixth,
management of schools; and seventh, providing the necessary means of livelihood for the poor.”
(Cited in Mahmud’s Diary, pp. 206-207). The same Tablet goes on to provide a
detailed exposition of tithes and administration of orphanage and other welfare
systems.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Residence in Haifa

7 May 1915
Today we attained the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá by the gardens of
His house. He said:

Now that I am waiting and expectant, I bear no
> blossoms, leaves, fruits or benefits. I wonder for what
> purpose the Ancient Farmer planted me! If the means
> were available for Me to be engaged [in some service], it
> would have been much better. I would teach and go
> from village to village, hamlet to hamlet, to all the places
> that I have never gone before. That would be truly
wonderful.

When a person is engaged in the mention of divine
> teachings and propagation of the Faith, great spirituality
> and attraction develop. Conversely, when one is speaking

> of worldly affairs, depression and sorrow result. Talking
> about temporal concerns consumes the life. The vernal
> breeze wafts over nature to give it life and energy; but
> the autumnal wind causes nature to pale and wither. I do
> not have the same joy and rapture that was experienced
> during the [American and European] journey. Even
> though it was a very difficult period, each day being
> spent in a different place, it was filled with ecstasy and
> happiness, spirituality and confirmation.

That night a copy of the Star of the West was read at the
Master’s house and the program of a Bahá’í gathering in San
Francisco was mentioned before ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He said:

Every instrument that has its own source of power
> will propel itself forward. Though I am here and all
> doors and paths are closed to Me, yet the Cause of God
> in the East and the West is progressing unceasingly, with
> the friends propagating the Word of God and raising the
> banner of the divine Faith. Rumí has versed:

The hand is invisible and yet,

Behold the pen that scribes
The dust is evident and yet,

The mount is indiscernible.

Indeed the hand is not evident, but the pen
> continues to flow. In similar fashion, the standard of the
> Faith is now hoisted across the globe though no
> standard-bearer is manifest; the Call of the Kingdom is
> raised without the crier; and the divine lamp is lit in
> absence of the niche. This is the power of the Cause and
> the reason why the Blessed Beauty, through the

> Mushíru’d-Dawlih, the [Iranian] Ambassador to Istanbul:
> “What is your purpose? If your intent is Me, I am in
> your hands, and you can perpetrate whatever harm and
> injuries you wish. But if your objective is to destroy the
> Faith of God, you will never succeed. You shall never be
> able to extinguish the lamp of the Cause, even should
> you combine with one another. This fire will
> communicate itself to all the horizons of the world, and
> therefore I have no worries!”

Preparation for Return to Iran
The period of our stay at Abu Sinan had now concluded. It was
about six months that we resided there under the shadow of our
Beloved. During this time we had no concern, sorrow or worry.
Every two or three days we would attain ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s august
presence, drink our fill from the billowing ocean of His utterances
and be intoxicated by the wine of the joy of His nearness.

Since the situation had returned to a relatively normal state and
the commotion and tumult of the early days of the War had
subsided, the Master instructed all the believers to return home.
Naturally, we369 were also no longer needed in Abu Sinan and,
consequently, closed the [Bahá’í] school and dispensary and returned
to Haifa.

Each of the few days that we were in Haifa, in a special way,
we received ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s bounties and favors. Because [the
Master] would say, “In Abu Sinan you practiced medicine and must
engage in that same service here,” I was under the impression that I
would remain in that city for some time. At other times, I was told,
“Extract statements from the letters of the Apostle Paul regarding
the prohibition to associate with the munáfiqin, and make a
compilation of them.”370 At other instances I would hear the rumor
that Áqá Ahmad Yazdí was instructed to purchase a ticket for me to
leave for America on a ship. In short, there were many ideas, but
eventually the divine plan and decree, and the heavenly will became
evident. “Whatever a person does not wish, is placed on him; much
like the wind pushing the sailboat in whatever direction it decrees.”

369A reference to Badí‘ Bushrú’í and Dr. Habíb Mú’ayyad.
370 Some of the statements in Paul’s epistles dealing with avoidance of those
promoting heresies and those with bad qualities can be found in: I Timothy 1:18-20;
II Timothy 2:14-21; Romans 16:16-18; I Corinthians 5:9-13; and II Thessalonians
3:6-15. Of interest may also be: Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, III.28.6.

God will direct the boat where He wants,

Even if the captain protest most vigorously.

One day I was summoned into ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence where
I received His abundant blessings and favors. This was an indication
that the day of my departure was fast approaching. He said:

I had wished for you to practice [medicine] in
> Haifa so that you would gain further expertise. However,
> I see that your work has concluded and your father is old
> and bent. He has suffered terribly, particularly after the
> martyrdom of your brother. From seeing you, he will
> gain new vigor and spirituality.

<230> Similarly He spoke of my future success in Iran. He
gave instructions pertaining to my residence in Kirmánsháh and the
necessity of observing great wisdom in all undertakings. He also
gave instructions for stay in Tihran and said, “Do as is appropriate.”

The following day He again spoke in a manner that confirmed
I would soon be leaving. For example, He said, “The best course is
to leave since your father is expecting you. Be assured of divine
bounties. Celestial confirmations will surround you. But you must
follow My instructions and do not allow yourself to become well-
known.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá by the Shrine of the Báb

8 May 1915
‘Abdu’l-Bahá summoned me and spoke the following exalted words
as we walked the streets and alleys:

You truly worked hard in Abu Sinan this year. You
> had no other purpose save the good-pleasure of God.
> Planting such seeds will assuredly give results. I hope
that your efforts in Beirut and the Holy Land will not fall

by the wayside. If they do not bear fruit today, then they
will tomorrow; and if not tomorrow, then definitely the
next day. It is not possible for someone to sow pure
seeds and then harvest weeds. Insha’lláh, great benefits
will appear from your work in Beirut. Always rely on
God. Ceaselessly His divine confirmations will pour
forth. Your services in Beirut and here will have great
results. It was very necessary to organize the gatherings
of the [Bahá’í] students in Beirut and see to their needs.
Insha’lláh it will have great gains.

I wanted you to stay here and practice medicine
since all the doctors have been taken away and a vast
field for practice is available. I once asked a British
physician, “Why do you not practice medicine in your
own country?” He responded, “I do not have the same
opportunities for practice. Several doctors must gather
and consult for every surgery. Then they closely
scrutinize to see if the primary physician has committed
an error or not. There are also many other obstructions.
But here I perform twenty surgeries every day [without
any interventions].” Therefore, I wanted you to practice
here for your own development and advancement.

However, on the other hand, I see that your work
here is completed for some time and your father is old
and bent. He especially suffered after the martyrdom of
your brother. From seeing you, he will gain new
spirituality and vitality.

Also, consider that Iran is an important field.

There is much work to be done there. Many wondrous
men will appear. They desperately need physicians,
especially like you, who are a spiritual healer and
attracted to the divine fragrance. Your life-giving breath
will bring healing.

I desire for you to raise the standard of guidance
and meet with prominent men. Since you are a physician,

> all doors will be open to you, but your focus must be
> solely the prominent figures. If you are well-known [as a
> Bahá’í], then you will be unable to render service. When
> you are remedying certain prominent citizens and discern
> in them a hearing ear, share the Word of God. However,
> all your teaching must be through deeds. [Teaching] a
> prominent person is equivalent to a thousand others. If
> two or three of the notables of Kirmánsháh embrace the
> Cause, great results will appear. When men like them
> accept the Faith, keep it secret and do not introduce
> them to the believers, as the foolish will be the cause of
trouble.

My point is to ensure you do not become well-
> known [as a Bahá’í]. Teach by deeds only. Praise be unto
> God that your intentions are sanctified and that you
> desire naught save service to the Cause of the Almighty.

This will indeed attract divine confirmations.

I said, “My Master, tyranny [in Iran] has reached a state that is
well beyond endurance.” He responded, “Since it occurs in the path
of God, then it has a sweetness of its own. Truly your brother was
raised and developed well, but the ungodly were jealous and
martyred him. Now, it is best for you to go for your father is
expecting you.”

Once more that afternoon in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s company we
went strolling. He remarked:

Your journey is indeed a blessed one because, for
> many years, you were in Holy Land and its vicinity, able
> to visit the Shrines of Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb, and
> engaged in service. Even though you were acquiring
> education, truly you and other students devoted your
> time to the service of the Cause of God. Your behavior
> in school was a service to the Faith and a source of its
exaltation. Now you are departing. Insha’lláh you will be

enabled to guide sanctified souls so that the fire of God’s
love will engulf that region. However, you must be
careful that once notables embrace the Faith, their
affiliation does not become public knowledge since
others will then cause difficulties for them.

The Prime Minister Mírzá ‘Alí-Asghar Khan had
embraced the Faith, but when it became public, he
withdrew. The reason is: when the friends see that
someone prominent has become a Bahá’í, they spread
the news, which causes complications for the new
convert and results in the authorities, the ‘ulamá and the
people arising against him. You must explain to the
community not to announce the names of such men.
This problem has prevented the diffusion of the Cause
of God.

The friends of God must teach by deeds and
conduct so that all will testify that verily their behavior
and manner is a reflection of the heaven above. At
worst, it may be said of them, “Alas, they are Bahá’ís!”
Although under all conditions, with utmost earnestness,
it would be testified on their behalf that they are
manifestations of sanctity, purity, piety, and sagacity.
Friends should regularly recite the Persian and Arabic
Hidden Words and behave in accordance with them. If
we live for only one day in conformity with those divine
edicts, it will have a profound effect in all corners of the
earth. Once a lamp is lit, it will instantly give brilliance to
all its surroundings.

Consider these nuns. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá pointed to
several nuns that were passing by.) They are not aware of
the teachings of Christ, nor of His ordinances, and
indeed are ignorant of everything. But in following their
own vain imaginings are in fact performing these
sacrificial deeds. They withdraw from society and normal
life and live in these convents. Some perform useful

> services, such as nursing of the injured and sick or
> educating children. Now, we must ask ourselves, we who
> stand as believers in the Blessed Beauty, who have
> understood the reality of His revelation and have borne
> witness to His days, what behaviors are incumbent upon
> us?

‘Abdu’l-Bahá then came to pace by the flower gardens of His
house when a number of impoverished people and nuns rushed
forward asking alms. The Blessed Tongue uttered these exalted
words:

From every direction destitution has surrounded
> man. Our affairs are presently such that we cannot offer
substantial help. “God will not burden any soul beyond

> its power.”371 Charity to the poor and needy is the best
> of all deeds. Similarly, providing welfare to the elderly,
> the disabled and orphans is the greatest service in the
> world of humanity. Its effect is like giving water to the
> thirsty soil, or bestowing life and spirit on the dead or
> granting the perfect healing medicine to the ill. The poor
> are the trust of God. Although they appear destitute
> before men, they are glorified in the Kingdom. And that
> is why the Blessed Beauty adopted the title Darvish,
> meaning, the poor:

Darvish, world is consumed by God’s blazing
flame,

It’s time to breathe life through Thy Hidden
Melody.

Or

Darvish, do not utter too many words,

Since of a word came forth this world.

His Holiness Christ lived in destitution, which is
> why He revealed, “Blessed are the poor.”372 However the
> wealthy person who is not held back by his riches,
> provides charity to the needy and spends generously in
> the path of God, he is preferred to the patient poor.
> That is because such a wealth is the manifestation of
> divine benevolence and the wellspring of good to the
whole of humanity.

We have been by this orchard for a while. Let us
go for a walk.

371Qur’an 2:286.
372This appears to echo Luke 6:20, “And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and
said, Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.”

Together we went to the house used by the Ancient Beauty
and, from there, to the house employed after His ascension and then
to a well in the German Colony. The Master said:

They have capped this well so that others would
> not benefit from its drinking water. Sanctified is God!
> What gain or profit do they expect by showing such
> iniquity towards others? Some people are unable to hide
> the secrets of their hearts and inner thoughts, and they
> are incapable of not perpetrating harm. In this regard,

‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Haifa circa 1915
373   A considerable fortune at that time.

This afternoon once more I was summoned into ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
presence. From His comments it was clear that I would soon be
leaving and that what lied ahead for me was the fire of separation
and the yearning to behold His countenance once again. But what
can one do except readily embrace His will! The Master said:

It is best for you to leave as your father expects
> your return. Be assured of divine bounties. His celestial
> confirmations will pour forth, and they are conditioned
> only on following My instructions. The confirmations of
> the friends reside solely in teaching the Cause. To the
> extent of his own abilities, each person must exert
> efforts in the field of teaching. Naturally, all major
> undertakings have their share of troubles and difficulties,
> but you must not be discouraged, perturbed, dismayed,
> wearied, or fatigued. I am certain that you will be able to
> render great victories. Be assured!
Today I attained the presence of the Master by the flower gardens of
His house, where He inquired, “Áqá Mírzá Habíb, are you ready to
leave? We are in suspense and waiting [for further events], but you
can leave. Perchance through the attraction of the divine fragrance,
illumination of heavenly tidings and profusion of sacred scents, you
will be able to sow pure seeds.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá at His Residence on Haparsim Street in Haifa

He then left for the Shrine of the Báb, and this ephemeral
servant was summoned to enter His presence.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá on His way to the Shrine of the Báb

<235> For a while He sat in front of the pilgrim house;
afterwards, He proceeded to the Shrine of the Báb to pay homage.
He chanted the Tablet of Visitation in a manner very different from
all previous occasions. His tone echoed a longing and inner yearning
that could melt the sturdiest stones and cause every sinful heart to
ascend unto the summit of glory. It profoundly touched all the
listeners.
Today, two or three times, either with others or alone, I attained
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence, but He did not say very much and was
silent, reflective and melancholy most of the time.

What immense loss for the ear,

and what regret for the eye!
This morning, in the company of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, we went strolling
through the street by the foot of the Mount Carmel. It was a clear
and brilliant morning. A vivifying breeze was gently blowing, and the
rhythmic sound of the waves of the azure sea was echoing in the

background. Birds were singing their carols of thanksgiving to the
Beloved and flying from one branch to the next. Besides these, no
other being or sound could be heard or seen in any direction.
Absolute serenity had filled the air, and except for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
I, no one else was around. Over the far away horizon, farmers could
be seen spreading seeds and attending to their fields. Ah, what a
magnificent morning!

O thou, lover of the flowing locks of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! Imagine
yourself, with a heart overflowing with longing and yearning, single
and alone, with Him; no noise, no commotion, no worries, no
interruptions, on a brilliant morning, in the midst of vast and green
fields. Then you can conceive the effect of that scene on my soul!
You are the evident book. The Commander of the
> Faithful374 has said, “You are the perspicuous Book,
> through whose words will appear that which is hidden.”
> A journey by you to Tihrán to interject a new vigor in
> the friends of God would be very good. You must meet
> with the believers in Hamadán and Kirmánsháh in
> private, but in Tihrán, do as is prudent.

I asked, “My Master, might I once again attain Your august
presence in this world?” He replied:

Insha’lláh, but mortal bodies may remain separated
> from one another. If we do not meet again in this world,
> then assuredly we will meet in the Abhá Kingdom,
> surrounded by the bounties of God, where we will
> partake of the feast of union and togetherness. So long

> connected. That connection and meeting is everlasting.

375  When my brother, Mírzá Múrád, was martyred, my father went [to the
authorities] and intervened for the release of his murderer. A long Tablet of
Visitation was revealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for my brother:

O God, my God! Thou seest Thy devoted servants athirst of the cup of mighty martyrdom
in Thy path, hastening to the field of sacrifice. They are enamored by Thy Beauty and longing to
behold Thee. Of these sacrificial, one is named Múrád and the other is called Bába Jan and verily
they have sought martyrdom in Thy path. They sipped from the chalice of sacrifice in Thy way and
hastened unto Thee and offered up their soul as a ransom for nearness to Thy Court. O Lord,
accept from them this great gift and make these two deliverance for those lost in the wasteland of
waywardness, aid them reach the dawning-place of Thy effulgent, enter them into the celestial
paradise of Thy union in all the worlds of light and abide them in Thy resplendent Kingdom. O
Lord, verily, these two were evident signs of Thy love and conspicuous words on the Tablets of Thy
Oneness. They were two sanctified souls amongst Thy friends, two radiant stars on horizon of
faithfulness and certitude of the heaven of Thy servitude. O Lord, bestow upon them through Thy
generosity and grace all that Thou has decreed in the Kingdom of Thy Light and grant patience
upon those related to them.

Verily Thou art the Clement, the Glorified, and the Munificent, and Thou art the
Benevolent, the Merciful and the Compassionate.

This morning, I was summoned by myself into the presence of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and together we went to the street of the German
[Templars]. He remarked:

Leave tomorrow assured of the bounties and the

378 With the encouragement and provocation of the Germans, for over six months,

the Ottomans prepared for the Egyptian campaign and the conquest of the Suez
Canal, which was serving as the artery of the British forces in the region. Whatever
the people of the nation possessed was seized forcibly for this campaign. Nearly
sixty thousand camels were arrayed for carrying weapons and other provisions,
particularly water. They attacked from the direction of Bathru’l-Sab‘. When they
came close, they were confronted with the opposing army who, in only 24 hours,
decisively defeated them. Jamal Pasha retreated to Damascus in the hopes of
preparing for yet a second campaign. (HM)

379   A reference to third Imam, Husayn son of ‘Alí.

Afterwards I was permitted to take my leave, and He left to
visit Zeki Bey.380 A number of dignitaries were with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at
lunchtime, and these included: the Qá’im-maqám of Haifa;
Kumandan of the military; Zeki Bey, the previous Kumandan; and
the city’s physician. After lunch, the party retired to the flower
garden. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was exceedingly happy and told several stories
of the convictions and deeds of Bektáshis381.

In the evening’s public meeting, a long Tablet was revealed in
honor of the soldiers in Nazareth. <240> Further, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
arranged for the release of an old man by the name of ‘Alí, who had
fallen on hard times and had previously appealed to the Master.
His especial favors are the garment of my being

for all to say: He is my God!

I was scheduled to leave today, but since one of the friends had
given a feast in my name, my departure was postponed to the
following day. In ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s company, we went to the German
Colony. He first showered His immense bounties on this ephemeral
servant by saying:

You gave us the education you had acquired and in
> turn we gave it to the poor. Now they think it will be
continued!

Your journey is of great importance, much like the
journeys of Isaiah. The Prophet Isaiah traveled

The Carmelite Monastery, on Mount Carmel, 1877

At lunchtime we went to the home of our host, where a
spiritual feast was magnificently spread. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá took His place
at the seat of honor and in His presence were such guests as: the
former Kumandan; ‘Abdu’l-Fattah Effendi, the Sa‘dí Mab‘uth [the

parliamentarian] and his son; and Muhsin Bey Kurdí. In the
afternoon we had tea in the presence of the Master and subsequently
went to the Cave of Elijah in His carriage, accompanied by the
honored Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí and Mírzá ‘Inayatu’lláh Isfahání.
Upon our departure from His residence, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked:

Today I had some yogurt. Since I am fond of Áqá
> Mírzá Habíb, I listen to whatever he prescribes.
> Normally I do not eat yogurt, as I dislike it. There are
> many things that a person may not like, and this very

> and enmity and had spoken most presumptuously in
> Bahá’u’lláh’s presence, I rebuked him one day. I did not
> wish to rebuke him; but he had greatly exceeded his
> bounds, and My reprimand was necessary. Afterwards, I
> ate a pear, and immediately My body began to severely
> ache. All My nerves were in pain and I grew very ill.
> Moreover, a considerable inner turmoil and convulsion
> overcame Me. I sensed that I desired some salt, so I had
> some. It helped. I had another piece, and then another,
> and soon I were well. My point is that whatever a person
dislikes is probably not good for him. ...382

The questioner decided to test him, so he asked, “How

Yesterday, you were such that none was like you,

Today, you have become such that none

‘Abdu’l-Bahá then turned to me and said:

The honored Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí said, “Teaching through
deeds is far more effective than through words.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá replied, “If both words and deeds were
congruent, then it would be much better. It would be light upon
light.”

Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí remarked, “Áqá Siyyid Asadu’lláh
Baqiroff wrote a letter and supplicated prayers. I responded, ‘Praying
will have no effect, even the prayers of the Chosen Ones, until a
person begins to carry out the intended deed. Notice that the
Blessed Beauty prayed that the Arch-Covenant-breaker [Mírzá
Muhammad-‘Alí] be confirmed in “that which is of nobility”, yet we
saw that it was not fulfilled. The confirmations attracted by deeds
are far greater than prayers offered in this regard.’ His response was,
‘One must have lived a worthy life to win an eternal reward.’ I
replied, ‘This world is school for acquiring spiritual qualities and
attributes. Therefore, sow worthy seeds so that you harvest
accordingly.’

‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “People are like trees and plants.

Similar to shrubs, the ones that seek worldly attainments will grow
and will have an attraction, but it will last only a few days. Whereas
sanctified souls are like these trees which are always flourishing,
lively, blossomed and fruitful. Consider this tree (He pointed to a
large and old olive tree): It has been here for at least two thousand
years, withstanding many assaults, and yet it continues to blossom
and be productive. It is astounding: People that are godly typically

become prosperous as well. But people that go after worldly
attainments lose both this world and the next.”

In His residence that evening, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá briefly remarked:
“The Blessed Beauty sent word to Mushíru’d-Dawlih, ‘What do you
hope to achieve with your enmity? If your target is Me, I am in your
hands. You can harm Me, imprison Me, bury Me in the depth of the
ocean, or crucify Me! But if your purpose is the Cause of God, then
know that you will assuredly fail in harming it in the least. All by
itself and without anyone’s help, the Faith of God will envelop the
horizons of the world. ‘To the regret of all enemies!’’”

The gathering concluded with a prayer.

The plan was for me to leave today, but ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s instruction
was to remain one more day as He wished me to convey a Tablet to
my father. In the afternoon, without my request and solely out of
His benevolence, He bestowed the following perspicuous Tablet:

Kirmánsháhan. The honored father of Áqá Mírzá
Habíbu’lláh, upon him rest the Glory of God, the Most Glorious.

He is God!

[Departure from the Holy Land]
With tearful eyes and broken heart, on 15 May 1915 I bade the
friends farewell and left for ‘Akká. I spent the 16th in Sur and the 17th
in Sayda, and since I was traveling with a leased horse, I had to
change the mode of transportation. I arrived in Beirut on 18 May
and for a day or two visited with the friends and students in that city
and said my goodbyes. <245> I left Beirut on 20 May and, by way
of Baghdad, proceeded to Iran.

The details of the journey and the rest of my life’s story are
recorded in other volumes of my memoirs.385

As noted earlier, the present translator has been unable to obtain information on

whereabouts of the diary notebooks.

Notes on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Utterances

In the name of the Almighty!

Several selections from the public or private utterances of the
Master that were on various scattered papers, post cards, or
elsewhere, and I feared may otherwise be lost, I now record in this
notebook, which is more secure. It should be noted: (1) I have
collected the personal Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in a separate,
ornamented volume and hope that my descendants would preserve
them like sweet life itself and consider this collection a source of
blessings and honor for the Mú’ayyad family; (2) the majority of the
following notes are extracted from my pilgrimage notebooks,
recorded mostly at a time when I was in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence. I
have also augmented these with several extracts from the notebooks
of Dr. Zia Baghdadi and others and have deposited them in this
treasure house.

Extract 1:386 [‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked:]

dated 17 Muharram 1334 A.H. [25 November 1915]:

387 After my return from the mission to Europe, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had wished for me to
go to America and had given complete instructions in this regard. However,
suddenly He dismissed me [from the Holy Land] and sent me instead to Iran. I
suspect that the martyrdom of my brother, Múrád, and the resultant sorrow, anguish
and wailing of my parents had prevented me from this service and had changed the
course of my life. “God knows best!” (HM)
388 I traveled with the honored Prince Shaykhu’r-Ra’ís when he was at Bahjí, and his

devotion, humility, faith and consecration to the Cause are a source of deep joy and
will never be forgotten. “Blessed is he and good was his end.” (HM)

397 Presumably a reference to the Bahá’í pogrom in Yazd which took place in the
summer of 1903 at the instigation of the governor of that city and resulted in the
loss of over 100 Bahá’ís.
398 The Arch-Covenant-breaker [Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí] had spread the rumor – I

take refuge with God – that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had escaped. He insisted that ‘Akká’s
Matrán send his agents in Jaffa and Alexandria to investigate the matter and they
telegraphed, “The renowned Gentleman is on the ship.” (HM)

404   Translation of poem from Memorials of the Faithful, pp. 30-31.

My “holy breath” was the confirmations of the Blessed
Beauty that were influencing and giving tranquility to
hearts and were gladdening people with the divine
tidings. I was but a humble instrument. Praised be God
that, in the soil of hearts, goodly seeds were sown that
will grow forever. Blessed souls were inflamed,
consecrated and arose to serve the Cause. Afterwards,
with utmost joy and happiness, I returned to the sacred
Threshold.

Praise the Lord that the friends of God came from
all directions to offer homage at the Sanctified Shrines.
Meeting and associating with them and through the
brilliance of their faces, my heart was gladdened and
assurance was gained that they were sacrificial in the path
of the Blessed Beauty. They had no purpose other than
His good-pleasure and no thought other than the
diffusion of divine fragrance. With consummate
devotion they circumambulated the point of adoration
of the Supreme Concourse and prostrated themselves at
the sacred Threshold and the Exalted Shrine of the Báb.
Then they returned to their homes. I remain hopeful that
great achievements and resplendent effects will result
from their return. Similarly, now you return and must
likewise journey by the divine splendor, heavenly tidings
and celestial attraction.

While I was not here, the friends-turned-strangers
[i.e. the Covenant-breakers] exerted efforts and
established, either outwardly or in private, relationships
with some of the friends. Upon My return, they
congregated and, once more, similar to the time of
[Sultán] ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd, wrote certain documents and
issued slanders. They presently have sent these to
Constantinople, thinking that they would persuade the
government to arise against Me, and to imprison, banish
or slay Me.

However, the friends of God must not fix their
> gaze on Me. This Cause is immensely great. It is the
> Cause of the Blessed Beauty. Thousands like Me will
> come and go, or never leave a trace. Our existence or
> absence is not important; what matters is the blessed
> Faith. The friends of God must remain firm, steadfast
> and constant. It is evident that I have always been in
> danger and will continue to remain in harm’s way;
> moreover, I will not be in this world forever, as a day
> will come when I desire to gain my eternal abode of the
> Merciful. The friends of God must remain absolutely
> loyal and not be perturbed in the least. Nay, day-by-day
they must grow in certitude, firmness, and constancy.

Consider how one by one the Disciples of Christ
> left this world because they fell martyred. Others, greater
> than they, arose in service to the Faith and manifested
> mightier efficacy, until the light of guidance illumined the
> horizons of the world. You must do likewise and be
> assured that the confirmations of the Blessed Beauty will
> pour forth. By God besides Whom there is no other
> God, if on this day the least of men was to arise in
> service to the Cause, divine confirmations and
affirmations would surround him from every direction.

May you always remain protected under the
> shadow of the Blessed Beauty. May you remain
> confirmed and successful, and may each of you become
> a heavenly standard in His path. May you be illumined
and attracted, revived by His hallowed breath.

Do not consider whether I am with you or not,
> whether I exist or not. Busy yourself with service to the
> Cause and fix your gaze on the Blessed Beauty. He will
> enable you to succeed without anyone’s aid. Seek
> assistance solely from Him. Remain firm in His Cause.
> Be a servant unto Him. Protect His Threshold and serve
it well. Be suppliant of His favors. Be illumined by His

> bounties and radiant by His light. Be safe and secure
> under His care and protection. Remain assured. “Verily,
> We behold you from Our realm of glory, and shall aid whosoever
> will arise for the triumph of Our Cause with the hosts of the
> Concourse on high and a company of Our favored angels.”405
Such is true happiness.

For instance, consider Áqá Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl.406

> How many victories he won! How in every situation,
> under all conditions, he was confirmed. By God besides
> Whom there is no God, <255> if one attains
> sovereignty over the East and the West, it would not
> profit him in the least. In the end, it is naught but
> immense regret. Where is Násiri’d-Dín Shah? Where is
> Muhammad Shah? Where is ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd? Where is
> ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz? Where is ‘Abdu’l-Majíd? Where is
> Napoleon? Where is Guillaume407? No trace or sign of
> them has remained. Though they were monarchs and
> reigned in utmost splendor, their end was naught but
eternal regret. We see this all around us.

Therefore, arise to remain constant in service to
> the sacred Threshold. This is the everlasting glory. This
> is the eternal bounty. This is the cause of the
> illumination of our souls in the Abhá Kingdom. This is
the cause of our growth in the boundless realms of God.

Upon you rest the Glory of God, the Most
Glorious.

405 Kitab-i Aqdas K53.
406 A poem in memory of Mírzá Abú’l-Fadl was recited in this gathering of the
friends in the house of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Haifa. As a eulogy for the illustrious Abú’l-
Fadl, this poem was composed by Hájí Fasihu’l-Mulk Shirazi, known as Shuridih,
and sent by Mírzá Muhammad-Baqir Khan Dihqan. (HM) [The two opening lines of
the poem are quoted by the diarist.]

the Cause and an associate of the Arch-Covenant-breaker [Mírzá
Muhammad-‘Alí], telegraphed one of his colleagues in Jaffa, asking
him to go and investigate – and I take refuge with God! – if ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá had fled onboard a ship. That Christian went onboard the boat
and inquired, “Are you ‘Abbás Effendi?” “Yes, I am”, responded
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. “I have heard of Your fame”, stated the man, “and I
have come to attain Your presence.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá answered, “I
know you.” When someone had followed the man, they had noticed
that he had gone directly to the post office, telegraphing, “The
renowned Gentleman is on the ship.”

Extract 7: The original of the following Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is
scribed by the Guardian of the Cause of God and is presently in my
possession, bearing ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s signature. Since it contains
important details about the defection of Dr. Faríd, I will record its
text in this notebook:

Paris. The illustrious Mr. and Mrs. Dreyfus[-Barney],
upon them rest the Glory of God.

Telegraph regarding your arrival in New York was received

protected there as well.

In these days your presence in Paris is especially necessary

patient I have been and how indefatigably I have endured this

arch-antagonist.

However, such incidents have been many. All those who

Áqá Jamal Burujirdí was the foremost Bahá’í and like

of remorse and regret.

The power of Covenant is like the brilliant sun, and its

I am confident about Paris and know that he will not be

Today the world pulsates by the power of the Covenant.

Inasmuch as Miss Knobloch408 was firm in the Covenant,

408 Miss [Alma] Knobloch was German-born and residing in Canada. She embraced
the Faith when the standard of the Cause was raised in the United States and this
prompted her return to Germany for the purpose of teaching the Faith. Though she
was 60 or 70 years old, she was very petite, and was often lifted and placed on a
table to deliver talks at the Bahá’í gatherings. However, once she commenced
talking, like a billowing ocean, profound thoughts poured out, and the audience was

opportunity.

deeply affected by her expositions. Repeatedly ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would comment in
humor, “Germany has made the world tremble and has gained immense victories.
However, through a small woman we have conquered Germany!” (HM) [Alma and
her sister Fannie from Washington, D.C., not Canada. Their third sister was Pauline
Hannen, whose husband Joseph was a disciple of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Alma was born in

Similarly, the Master said to Áqá Mírzá Habíbu’lláh [Mú’ayyad]:

> “Through divine bounties and favors, you must perform

occur among people.’ ...410

Give talks in public meetings. Speak of the love of

Elsewhere it is recorded that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked:411

These issues (violations of the Covenant) are like the

that this talk was given during the closing days of 1913 while the Master resided in

I spoke with them at length about material and
spiritual education. Their headmaster was a good man

and was exceedingly kind and generous to us.415

Are the teachers in Beirut satisfied with your
415A slight variation on the same talk of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is noted in the diary of Mírzá
Ahmad Sohrab (Star of the West, issue 20 August 1918) and is quoted below for ease
of reference:

When I was in Dublin, the professor of the out-door school

progress? (The students responded positively.) “It is best
when others testify [to one’s virtues].” Indeed, the
Bahá’ís, and especially the youth, must conduct
themselves in such wise that everyone would testify to
the excellence of their character and qualities. There is a
great joy in this. Every time I see you, I am filled with
delight. Praised be God that it is so.

A person must live in a way that can win the praise
of God, His chosen ones and the society. If he is able to
achieve this, utmost happiness is his. One’s heart is filled
with joy when one has won the good-pleasure of the
sacred Threshold. It is then that the heart overflows with
happiness. And no matter what may befall a person then,
no matter what trials and tribulations beset him, his heart
will remain joyful. He will then be like a sea that while
experiencing storms and thunders on the surface, yet
remains calm and serene at its depth. Otherwise, man
cannot become happy with anything else, and if he does,
it is transient and passes in a day or two.

For instance, if a person discovers a treasure, his
happiness is temporary, but his troubles are endless.
Should he win the good-pleasure of God, the praise of
the chosen ones and the approval of people, this is a
treasure that has joy upon joy. No loss or regret will
come from this, and he will always remain energized,
happy, joyful and thankful.

In this world there is no bounty greater than
spiritual joy. Such a joy is the supreme favor bestowed
upon man. For instance, when a person solves a
scientific problem, an immense joy comes to him. Or
similarly when he is able to do a humanitarian act or
achieve a great undertaking, his heart is filled with elation
and satisfaction.

It is written that Khawjih Násiru’d-Dín Túsí was a
skilled mathematician. He would spend his nights on the

> roof of his house observing the movement of stars and

> difficult problem in astronomy, he would be so thrilled
> that he would begin dancing, saying, “Where are the
> kings to see what true joy consists of, and where are the

true bliss!”

It is because of this fact that in the divine Tablets

Extract 11: 13 July 1914 - After Mírzá ‘Alí-Akbar Rafsanjáni
chanted a prayer in a gathering of the friends in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
house in Haifa, the Master recounted the following:416

Elsewhere ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stated (regarding Azal):

asked about ‘Ád425 and Thamúd426. The Master responded:

We came before His house in ‘Akká where an unkempt Arab beggar
with filthy clothes and dirty, uncombed hair came to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.
With utmost affection the Master caressed his face and beard and
spoke many words of encouragement and humor to him: “May God
grant you bounties. May God gladden your heart. What a wonderful
chin! How is your health?” After the Arab beggar left, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
said:

A large, beautiful rooster was walking under the sun and picking
seeds, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “If roosters were rare, people would
go from city to city to see and admire them. However, their
abundance has prevented an increase in their value.”

We strolled to the seashore in His blessed presence. When we
first reached the shore, portions of the seawall looked in utter
disrepair. The Master said, “This world is the plane of combination
and dissolution. The process never stops: On one side it creates new
430Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, p. 95.
431The original is “munáfiq” which may be understood in this context to refer to
those who rebel against the Covenant.

people, and on the other it destroys what she has created. The world
will not grow tired. How numerous are the days witnessed by the
world! They had buildings along this section [of the walls] and in
front of them they had built a bathhouse. With these rocks they had
made a natural pool and therein would wash their cloths.”

When we reached a fork in the road, the Master asked, “Which
way should we go?” Ustad Muhammad-‘Alí Banná [master-builder],
who at times chanted prayers in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
suggested, “Going right is better.” The Master remarked, “Indeed,
right is more desirable and left is not. Even the right hand is
stronger than the left and it does all the work: It writes and performs
various tasks. But when the right-hand is tired, engaged, injured or
paralyzed, then the left hand does its work. In Arabic, right [yamín]
is pleasant. It has two meanings: right and oath.”

We came near a young boy selling oranges. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
inquired, “Do you like oranges?” We responded that we did, and He
purchased ten oranges. Meanwhile two Arab girls approached and as
they were looking at us, the Master said to them, “You each take five
oranges as well.” One of them responded, “But we have no money.”
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “No problem. I shall pay for them.” When the
little girls took the oranges to their mothers, they realized that the
fruit-seller had taken more money than he should have. So, they ran
after him to take more oranges, as he fled while being chased. It was
an entertaining scene as the Arab women pursued the young orange
merchant!

Afterwards, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá instructed this ephemeral servant to
report about my visit to Germany. He said, “German means ‘Our
kinsmen.’432”

I asked, “Would it be possible for the Master to once more bless
the western world with His footsteps?”

He replied, “Europe is far. I wish to go to Jerusalem and Medina

432In Persian, German can be read as “Ál-i man” meaning, our clan, our family.
Interesting enough, german seems to have the same meaning, “of the same parents or
grandparents,” c.1300, from germanus “of brothers and sisters,” related to germen (gen.
germinis) “sprout, bud.”

since these cities are near.”

I said, “Herr Galtsiner433 would cry and say, ‘Tell ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that
I want to sacrifice myself for Him!’ as he was being taken to the
battlefield.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “Yes, Monsieur Bernard was also taken to
the battlefield, but if there was a single person in the world who was
against war, it was he. He detested it most intensely and was so
utterly against it that I am unable to describe it for you. However, he
was forced into joining the combat. For those who have sacrificed
themselves in the path of God, it is difficult to sacrifice instead for
mere soil, which is the least worthy [reason for sacrifice] in all
creation.”

I said, “In Germany, nationalistic slogans and patriotic military
marches are heard from one direction, and from another, talks given
in the Bahá’í gatherings and the voices of prayer and supplication to
God are heard. Indeed it seems that the believers have no cares
about these ominous affairs, and are solely occupied with the
mention of God and spiritual matters.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “Verily, it is most astounding to raise the
divine call in the midst of such commotion and chaos. In truth,
during our seven or eight days in Stuttgart, the light of God’s love
was so brilliantly aglow that the friends were exceedingly joyful and
happy. Good seeds were planted.”

I said, “These friends are indeed righteous and their Bahá’í teachers
must, of a certainty, have been devoted and firm in the Covenant
and Testament, and had been pious and righteous, which is why the
Cause of God is progressing so remarkably.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “Yes, from the very beginning, good seeds were
planted.”

I related, “Miss Schwarz434 brought two books to her mother, one
by [Leo] Tolstoy and the other by Victor Hugo. She asked, ‘My
teacher gave these to me to read. Are they appropriate readings for
434Presumably the daughter of Consul and Alice Schwarz – the most eminent of the
Stuttgart Bahá'ís.

me?’ Her mother replied, ‘My darling, they have no benefit to you
insofar as the Faith is concerned and may even dampen your
devotion. Whatever reduces your love for the Cause is harmful to
you. Therefore take these back.’ She immediately returned them to
the original owner.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “Marhabá [welcome]! Well said. Yes, it is
indeed so. While in Europe, I always proclaimed, ‘The Cause of
Bahá’u’lláh embraces all the past Dispensations and manifests all
their benefits to human society. It is like a tree that has many strong
branches. The Faith of Bahá’u’lláh contains all the teachings
beneficial to the world of humanity and will profit every segment of
society. For instance, the New Testament speaks of compassion,
kindness, forgiveness and clemency. These same teachings exist in
the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. The Qur’an speaks of justice and
punishment, and these same concepts are preserved in the Cause of
Bahá’u’lláh. In short, whatever good and productive precepts exist
among the diverse groups of humanity are all present in the Cause
of God. In addition, the Faith offers certain principles which others
lack. For instance, [the principle of] the oneness of humanity;
religion must be cause of love and fellowship; religion must be in
accord with reason and science; proclamation of universal peace;
equality of men and women; promotion of learning and spirituality;
and many others.’”

I shared a few short anecdotes related to the Bahá’ís of
Stuttgart and made loving mention of Herr Grunsuik435, who had
composed many poems about the Faith. I also related the story of a
[German] soldier who treated the French prisoners of war as
brothers. Moreover, I noted, “Recently Professor [Heinrich] Jaeger,
his wife and daughters embraced the Faith, and, every time we spoke
of the Cause or mentioned the martyrs of Iran and the sufferings
endured by the believers in that land, this old and spiritual man
would cry profusely with tears flowing over his white beard.”
‘Abdu’l-Bahá warmly encouraged me to say more, remarking,

“Tell more of the faith and the faithful,

as it brings joy to the world and heart.

Your words are indeed pleasing! You speak of the friends of
God!” I related, “Each day we would talk of such things and remind
ourselves: ‘Who would have thought from the period that the
Blessed Perfection was taken barefoot and bareheaded from
Niyávarán to Tihrán until the time that the Commission of Inquiry
planned to send the Master to Fizan, such remarkable victories
could be won? Who would have predicted such a majestic day as
today?’”

We continued walking in the company of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the
cemetery where a number of the early believers were buried. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá stood by the graves and, with hands raised heavenwards,
whispered prayers and supplicated divine mercy for those resting in
their eternal abode. The experience was so profound that we all
yearned to have been buried there and with our hearts proclaimed:

Shouldst thou pass by my grave even in a hundred years,

I will tear open the shroud and start life anew.

When we left the cemetery, we continued strolling to the train
station where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sat in the terminal and said to this
ephemeral servant, “Now that you have become a physician, come
and take my pulse.” As soon as I checked His blessed pulse, I was
shocked and reported, “Your pulse is very slow, but regular. The
arteries seem to have the proper flow.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked,
“From the age of thirty, I have had a slow pulse. All others have a
pulse rate of about 75 to 80 [per minute] and therefore greatly
wonder about my pulse rate. What rate did you measure?” I said, “I
did not count the rate, but suspect that it is about forty [per
minute].” He responded, “No, it is 45 to 46. Count for yourself.” I
closely counted with my watch and it was 45. So I reported the
result. He stated, “If I have a fever, it goes up to 50.”

<270> Side notes: It is natural for everyone to wonder and have
this curiosity to ask: In what way is the human temple of the chosen
ones different from us mortals? This question was particularly
pertinent for someone [like me] who was a trained physician and
who, for some time, had been in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence and had
observed His ways, talks, manners, qualities, attributes and majesty –
characteristics that completely distinguished Him from all others.
Whatever effulgence radiated from His sacred self was truly unique
and peerless. None reflected such light or manifested these qualities.
And if curiosity prompted certain observations, these conclusions
were limited to the understanding of the observer and not reflective
of His mighty station, as no other is permitted into that hallowed
realm. This is because the lower creation is not permitted unto the
higher and is defined by its own limitation. And if this ephemeral
servant commits certain recollections to paper, it only stems from
my own limited perspective and is not reflective of His lofty station.

There was a particular wish that was always present in my
thoughts, but I would not be presumptuous enough to speak of it. I
always wanted to perform a physical examination of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
and know the details of His condition. I wanted to closely examine
His internal organs, to determine the state of each of the principal
bodily systems at His age, and establish which one, if any, was not
functioning properly and if He suffered from any ailment. In short,
this was my long cherished desire and this thought never left me.
Indeed, day-by-day, it grew stronger and had enveloped my
thoughts. However, every time I thought of actually suggesting this
idea to the Master, a great turmoil would overwhelm me: my heart
would beat loudly, I would gasp for breath, my throat would dry and
my whole being would shake. Therefore, I would remain silent and
not speak of this idea. It was like this for a while, but this wish never
left me.

One day without any prior discussion, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said,
“Mírzá Habíb, God wanted your labor not to go to waste and
therefore enabled you to serve the divine friends and now you

remedy their ills. Come remedy Me as well. I want you to give Me a
thorough physical examination. You cannot just cure all others
except Me!” I realized that in that instant my long cherished hope
had materialized and my prayers had been answered. I was so
thrilled that I was shaking, my heart was palpitating, and my tongue
was tied. Nevertheless, I began the examination.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá removed His clothes and shirt and, with the
utmost care, I examined every organ and vital part from the tip of
His head to His toes. His hair was thick and flowing. His eyebrows
were thick and all His fingernails were white, bright and shiny. All
His teeth were in perfect condition, with no sign of cavity or
disorder. His eyes and auxiliary organs were in their natural state, but
the eye-lens was showing evidence of advanced age.436 No signs in
His throat, ears or nose indicated a pathological condition. I checked
His nose and tonsils and found no inflammation or polyp. Though
‘Abdu’l-Bahá often suffered from a cold, I did not see anything out
of the ordinary in His nose.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá only complained of insomnia and an occasional
“fever of nerves”, which were due to depression, sorrow and
anguish. His beard was thick and His hair full, soft and strong. (I
have kept some of His hair strands as a memento, and they are like
white silk threads.) His cardiac rhythm was regular, but very slow.
His arteries were well flowing, pulsating and full, and showed no
sign of blockage. His blood pressure was normal and the blood
vessels manifested no evidence of arching. All the internal organs
seemed healthy with no pain or discomfort in the liver, spleen,
kidneys, appendix, intestines or the bladder. His reflexes were
normal.

In short, I found nothing abnormal in my examination and
reported the results to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, saying, “I did not note anything
that could be a cause of illness.” He replied, “When the doctors in
Europe examined Me, they too did not find anything wrong.437 My
436 Sometimes, but not always, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would use corrective glasses for reading
and writing. However, He often read and wrote without the aid of glasses. (HM)
437 Since my examination was taking place during World War I, I did not have access

fever is a fever of the nerves. It is not related to any bodily organs.
My nerves are tired, since waves of tribulations do not cease to waft
over Me. However, through the bounties and favors of the Blessed
Beauty, My spirit is refreshed and cheered. Bring Me some [ethyl
carbonate of] quinine438. My nerves are tired. Now all our troubles
rest with you, Mírzá Habíb. Is it possible for you to shoulder
everyone else’s burden and not ours? God did not wish your years
of study to go to waste and, therefore, provided you with this
service.”

In my medical books I have not located a reference to the
“fever of nerves” which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá mentioned, but it is clear that
whenever He was beset by sadness, or by the news of disunity
among the friends, or differences and discord among the believers,
or by the receipt of letters which contained grievances regarding
certain dealings or transactions, or when the Covenant-breakers and
the munáfiqín had injured the Faith of God and caused certain
believers to grow doubtful, then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s temperature would
instantly rise and He would develop several degrees of fever.
Conversely, whenever joyous news were received indicating that the
Faith had taken yet another step forward, or one of the believers had
performed a humanitarian deed, or a philanthropic institution was
established at a particular place, evidence of joy and happiness
would instantly appear on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visage, and His fever
would subside. Because of this, the Greatest Holy Leaf and the
honored Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí often tried to convey glad tidings to
the Master, thereby causing pleasure and delight in His person.

In the Streets of ‘Akká:439 We were strolling in the company of the

to a laboratory to perform various tests in addition to clinical examination. It so
happened that none were needed anyway since in Paris and London, through the
insistence of certain Bahá’ís, laboratory tests had been performed and everything
was found to be in the normal range. (HM)

Master in the streets of ‘Akká. When we reached the gate by the
Qaraghul-Khanih,440 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “First they wanted to
imprison us here, but we refused.441 Consequently, they took us to
the citadel.” Along the way, wherever the people of ‘Akká were
congregated or were sitting, at the sight of the Master they would
rise in full height and greet Him affectionately. Soldiers, notables,
divines, pilgrims, shopkeepers, mendicants and in short, whoever we
passed by, would instantly bend low with hands reaching the soil
and then bring it over their head, thereby offering the customary
expressions of submissiveness, reverence and humility before
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Children playing in the streets would quit their play
and run up to the Master and kiss His hands, and then return to
their games. Sanctified is God! What manner of Prisoner is this
Whose might and sovereignty has humbled all who see Him! What
influence is this that has so deeply penetrated and enveloped both
friends and foes! Is He a captive and a prisoner, or is He the most
powerful and supreme monarch of the time?!

En route someone came and implored ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to
temporarily lease the rooms of the Mansion [of Bahjí] so that, during
the disturbances in ‘Akká, he and his family could take refuge there.
The Master responded, “For the sake of your grandfather I will
permit you. I can never forget your grandfather. Yes, I will let you,
but it is for his sake.” When he left, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “This
person was a grandson of Mahmúd Effendi Safadi442. The late
Mahmúd Effendi was a believer and a wonderful man. But after his
passing, because of the gossip mongering of the Covenant-breakers
against us and the doubts that they instilled in them, his family
completely severed their ties with us. <275> This man was a friend
440 A Turkish word, meaning police station. When the exiles Arrived in ‘Akká in
1868, they were taken to this building which is still there in the middle of ‘Akká and
were told that this is where they would be kept. But Bahá’u’lláh refused to accept
this as it was far too small. So they were taken to the citadel.
441 Presumably a reference to the arrival of Bahá’u’lláh and His entourage in late

August 1868.

of Faríq443 and truly adored him, and the Covenant-breakers were
constantly provoking him to harm us and cause mischief at an
opportune time.”

Mírzá Núri’d-Din Zayn related that the late Mahmúd Effendi,
the Mufti, was a courageous man from ‘Arrabí, one of the villages of
‘Akká, and the people of the region greatly respected him. After he
became a believer, he would go into the countryside at nights to see
if a [Bahá’í] pilgrim had arrived. He would carry a lantern with him
and, when he had encountered a pilgrim and had ensured that
indeed he was a Bahá’í, he would give him the lantern to carry in
front of him. People seeing Shaykh Mahmúd coming from behind
would think that it was his servant who carried the lantern for him
and in this way the pilgrim would gain admittance into the city. After
the pilgrim had attained the presence [of Bahá’u’lláh], he would, in
the same fashion, be conducted outside the city [of ‘Akká], and told
by the Shaykh, “God is most sovereign!” Thus, the Shaykh was
instrumental in bringing the pilgrims into the sacred presence.444
Upon him rest the mercy of God!

Extract 13: For some time the citizens of the coastal region did
not have a moment of rest and were constantly worried and agitated
by the authorities. Everyone was expecting the worst and predicted
imminent bombardment of the port cities by [foreign] warships. In
fact, one day a warship bombarded the steel bridges between Haifa
and ‘Akká, and an artillery shell landed in the Ridván Garden, but it
did not explode and caused no harm. The Ottoman soldiers had dug

443 Faríq was a member of the Commission of Inquiry who had come with ‘Árif Bey
and Miralay Adham Bey, the Damascene, for the purpose of investigating and
persecuting ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Faríq died of typhoid. Three bullets of a sentry in
Constantinople killed ‘Árif Bey. And Adham Bey fled to Egypt, went to Hájí Siyyid
Yahyá begging for money, and eventually perished. (HM)
444 The same story is told in Hasan Balyuzi, Bahá’u’lláh the King of Glory, p. 338, where

it is attributed to a memoir of Mírzá Núri’d-Dín Zayn – a document which the
present translator has been unable to locate.

trenches and therein had readied defenses. It was stormy for a few
days, but soon it became sunny again.

30 November 1914 was a clear, bright day with a calm sea and
no waves disturbing the water, nor could any tide be discerned.
From afar, the Zeeb underwater rifts, which were typically covered
by the waves, were now seen, and the people of ‘Akká mistook them
for armored warships. Therefore the entire city of ‘Akká fled in fear,
leaving behind only a few handicapped, such as the blind or
crippled. People commandeered whatever mule, horse, donkey or
camel they could find and with them hastened their families’ flight
to the outskirts. The entire city was evacuated. Doors and windows
were left open and, if anyone had come to rob the whole city, there
would not have been a soul left capable of preventing him. Under
such conditions, His Holiness ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stayed in ‘Akká with
Áqá Asadu’lláh Káshí445 in His service, and none other. The
Mutasarrif of ‘Akká had cabled Beirut that four enemy warships
were fast approaching the city, and this news had further perturbed
the citizens of ‘Akká.

I was in Abu Sinan when all this was occurring, and the
handmaiden of God, Mrs. Sanderson, came with Isfandiyár’s
carriage and informed me that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had summoned me.446 I
immediately went to ‘Akká. Even though I arrived at a time when
people had began to return to the city, it was evident that a major
commotion was still stirring. Like a scene from the Day of
Resurrection, the whole population of the city was in exodus into
the fields and the surrounding regions. With indescribable fear they
had taken flight, convinced that life and possessions were lost for
445 In fact there were two Asadu’lláh’s [God’s lion] residing in the house of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and the believers humorously called one of them the “He-lion” and he was
Áqá Siyyid Asadu’llah Qumí and the other, Áqá Asadu’llah Káshí, was called the
“She-lion.” The latter was short in stature and most humble and remained with the
Holy Family to the end of his life. About him ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would say, “Despite his
small stature, Áqá Asadu’lláh would wear a large dagger and accompany the Blessed
Beauty in Baghdad, and the enemies of the Cause would not dare be
presumptuous.” (HM)
446 Bushrú’í, p. 58, indicates this occurred on the following day, 1 December 1914.

certain.

In the evening, when I attained the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
at His residence, a number of the believers were present as well.
Because of the day’s occurrences, the Master spoke the following
words on the night of 1 December 1914 in the house of ‘Abbúd:

> Today a number of people came to Me and asked, “Why
> do You not leave the city?” They protested our decision
> to stay in ‘Akká amidst so much commotion and
> confusion! I said to them that I had seen days which

like that.

Each group and strata of society was given one of
the believers to martyr. For instance, the gunners were
447 An extremely barbarous manner of execution in which lighted candles are
inserted into incisions made in the victim’s body, who slowly burns and bleeds to
death.
448 Certain prominent Bábí martyrs have likened their scene of martyrdom to a

nuptial feast. For instance, it is reported that when Quddús’ stepmother insisted that
he marry, he promised that in a few years she would witness his glorious wedding
feast, to be held on the city’s main square. It was on that exact spot that, after a trial
by forty of the leading ‘ulamá, Quddús suffered a most horrible martyrdom,
witnessed by the whole city.

the enemies of the Cause regarding the incident of the assassination
attempt on the Sháh, is related to the talk of the Master recorded

bliss. When we closely consider man’s affairs, we see that

selfishness is man’s pit of darkness. This is because a
selfish person does not regard the deeds, behaviors and
sayings of other people, but rather approves of his own
self.

God forbid that any of us become selfish. God
forbid! God forbid! God forbid! When we look at our
own selves, we must see ourselves as coarser, humbler,
lower than any other. And when we look at others, we
must see in them the essence of perfection, attainments
and knowledge. That is, we must look at others through
the eye of God. We must see them as distinguished and
our own selves as inferior. Whatever faults we see in
others, we must see them also in our selves, because if
we were not faulty, then we would not see that fault. A
person must always see himself as deficient and others as
perfection.

There is a story – though it did not occur in
actuality – that I share as a means of furthering our
contrition. They say that one day His Holiness Christ –
may My spirit be a sacrifice unto Him – and His Apostle
passed by a dog that had died and was decaying. One of
the Apostles said, “How odorous!” Another remarked,
“How he has decomposed!” The third said, “How
offensive!” But Christ said, “What shiny, bright teeth he
possesses!” Notice that His Holiness Christ did not see
any of his faults. He looked closely until He found the
white teeth to comment on and disregarded all else.

Know that a heart that is brightened by the
effulgence of the Blessed Beauty would never utter the
word “I.” It is this word “I” that proves selfishness: I
did this, or I did that; I did well and the other did poorly.
This word “I” is a darkness that extinguishes the light of
faith. This one word will cause complete remoteness
from God!

463Diary of Mírzá Ahmad Sohrab records a slight variation of the same talk, given
on 25 July 1914 (Star of the West, 9 April 1917) and for ease of reference is noted

bore no fruits from the tree of his life.

When one considers the life of sanctified souls,
this issue becomes indubitably clear. For example, Christ
and the Prince of Martyrs – may My spirit be a sacrifice
unto Them – spent all Their days in service to God and
at the end quaffed from the chalice of martyrdom. Now,
were Their lives more beneficial, or the rule of Yazíd and
Mu‘áwiya, who acquired naught but eternal damnation,
everlasting rebuke, and deprivation from the grace of
God? Outwardly They were immersed in great afflictions
and surrounded with tribulations, while sovereignty,
glamour, comfort, joy and ease embraced [Yazíd and
Mu‘áwiya]. However the truth is the opposite of what is
outwardly manifest.

These sanctified Beings gave illumination to the
nations, bestowed spirituality on the world of humanity,
revived the hearts, conferred divine tidings upon people,
advanced human qualities, manifested heavenly bounties
and dispensed celestial favors. What immense benefits
became apparent from Them and how great the fruits
left by Them! And these are only what are evident in this
world, so you can imagine how much greater are the
effects in the Kingdom.

For instance, was it better if His Holiness the
Exalted One [the Báb] – may My spirit be a sacrifice
unto Him – had spent His days busy with transitory
worldly concerns or that He dedicated His life to God
and spent His days in suffering, tribulation and affliction,
at the end drinking from the cup of self-renunciation?
Sanctified souls and divine Prophets sustained immense
suffering, but it was only for a period. For example,
Yahyá ibn Zakaríya languished for a few days. Christ’s
suffering was for three years: days of trials and
tribulations, followed with the exalted station of
martyrdom. Most resplendent of all was the feast of

> suffering spread before the Prince of the Martyrs [Imám
> Husayn]. Indeed it was a feast filled with every kind of
> bounty: from one direction, exiled from home; from
> another plundered and pillaged; from yet another, his
> family and all kin held captive after His martyrdom; and
> from another direction, the martyrdom of some
> prisoners. In short, it was a feast in which every manner
> of delicacy and goodly food was available. Then they
> seized the blessed widow of the Imám and raised the
> severed heads of the martyrs above lances, leading this
> procession from city to city. All the suffering of the
> Imám was from morning to noon, though no greater
> sacrifice can be conceived than His. That is, no example
> can be offered greater than His sacrifice and self-
renunciation on the field of martyrdom.

Nevertheless, from the dawn of His Manifestation,
> His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb] was always
> imprisoned, and until His martyrdom seven years later,
> He was banished from one prison to the next, each day
> enduring a fresh wave of afflictions and hardship.
> Similarly, the sufferings of the Blessed Beauty lasted fifty
> years, during which he endured multitudes of adversities,
> difficulties, insults of enemies, injuries from foes, pillage
> and plunder, imprisonment and captivity, beating and
> abuse. Then He was crowned with banishment to
> foreign lands, first to Iraq, then to Constantinople, to
> Adrianople, and eventually to the Prison City of ‘Akká
> where criminals and murderers were confined. For fifty
years, each day had a new trial. ...464

Now that the sanctified Manifestations of God
> have sacrificed in such wise, if we indeed hold a particle
> of fidelity, how great should be our sacrifice by this
> sacred Threshold! How immense should be our

Therefore we must be constantly exerting efforts,

Extract 17: On the occasion of someone meeting with one of the
Covenant-breakers, [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] remarked:

Through the tongue of His Manifestation, God has

467 Lit. traveler, wayfarer.
468 Lit. lavishness and prodigality.
469 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s point is to show the absurdity of discourse among these so-called

seekers of truth.
470 Qur’án 19:58. This verse of the Qur’án is revealed in honor of Enoch and

appears in several prayers of Bahá’u’lláh (e.g. Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p. 25).

> revealed: “O Son of Spirit! The best beloved of all things in My
> sight is Justice; turn not away therefrom if thou desirest Me, and
> neglect it not that I may confide in thee. By its aid thou shalt see
> with thine own eyes and not through the eyes of others, and shalt
> know of thine own knowledge and not through the knowledge of thy
neighbor.”471

Therefore a person must see things through his

oneness.

For instance, how did it come to pass that certain
> of the Prophet’s disciples, His travel companions, and of
> the Ansár, rose with such fierce indignation to slay the
> Prince of the Martyrs [Imám Husayn] – may My spirit be

Extract 18: Regarding war, [‘Abdu’l-Bahá] remarked:

The following version of the same talk is recorded in the diary of Mírzá Ahmad

\[474\] 
Sohrab (Star of the West, 16 October 1914) and attributed to the words of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá spoken on 8 August 1914:

Extract 19A: ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s talk on 3 August 1914:475

475 Dr. Mú’ayyad was in Germany on this date and therefore he must have copied

this talk from someone else’s diary.

churches and assemblies in America and Europe, telling
them, “The present situation is most dangerous. Europe
is like a powder keg, short of a spark. While there is time,
come, aid and extinguish this fire, that perchance War
may be prevented.” But they heeded not My counsel.
Now this is the result; whereas, they should know that
war is the destroyer of the human foundation. It ruins
the world and has no benefit whatsoever. Both the victor
and the vanquished suffer. It is like two ships colliding.
If one sinks the other, the one remaining will suffer
perilously as well.

The most that can be expected is that one
government will temporarily prevail over another. But
this victory is transient. A few days later, the vanquished
will become the victor. How many times has it been that
France has overcome Germany, only for Germany to
come back and overcome France!

How amazing the effect of vain imaginings when
truth has no influence! How truly amazing! For instance,
the belief in the difference of races is pure imagination,
and yet it exerts great sway. Though all are human,
nevertheless, some have named themselves Slavonic,
others German, Chinese, French or British. But this
difference of races is pure fantasy. Yet how powerful is
its effect and sway! In reality though we are all one and
the same! It is clearly evident that the whole of humanity
is one, but this truth has no currency, whereas racial
difference, which is fiction and illusory, has great
predominance.

So many wars have been fought, so much blood
has been shed, so many homes have been ruined, so
many cities have been destroyed, and yet, they are not
tired of war. Hearts are still hard like stone. People have
not grown repentant. They have not awakened. This
enmity and rancor is the obliterator of the human

people’s ease and happiness.

How people are agitated! How many fathers will

Indeed, they have brought widespread joy and comfort.

476Original term is “mahkamih kubrá”. According to the text of this talk, apparently
‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke both “mahkamih ummumí” and “mahkamih kubrá”. The
present translator is not familiar with the use of “mahkamih kubrá” in the Writings
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. However, “mahkamih ummumí” appears in His Will and
Testament and has been translated as “Supreme Tribunal” by Shoghi Effendi.

<295> Extract 20: In Abu Sinan, on the occasion of the
martyrdom of the honored Shaykh ‘Alí-Akbar Quchání [in
Khurásán], ‘Abdu’l-Bahá commented on 9 April 1915:

> These wretched soldiers die for the sake of some soil,
> which is the lowest form of creation, and do not know
> why they are slain. Consider how some are refined and
> how some abase themselves. In the world of humanity,
> some sanctified souls appear in human temple that are
> revered by the whole of creation, while some others
> appear that worship soil and give their life in the path of
> dirt and rock. The latter are the abased! And yet there are
> some others who readily give their all – their lives,
> possessions, comfort and position – in the path of the
> Blessed Beauty. How vast is the difference between
> those who sacrifice in the path of the soil and those that
> sacrifice in the path of the Blessed Beauty! The former is
> inferior to soil, while the latter has won the eternal
> crown of glory. The former will gain naught but grievous
> loss, but the latter will give life to the world by their
sacrifice.

Similarly to the honored Shaykh ‘Alí-Akbar, many
> have quaffed from the chalice of martyrdom at the time
> when they were raising the call of the Abhá Kingdom,
> guiding others to the religion of God, giving existence to
> others, sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, a voice to
> the mute and life to the dead. In such a state, in utmost
> detachment, they drank from the cup of renunciation.

Thousands upon thousands of people are presently
> being killed on the battlefield, though their deaths will
> bear no fruit or benefit whatsoever. But one sanctified
> soul is martyred in the path of God and thousands of
> others are given life. They water the tree of God with
> their own blood. Though they close an eye to this mortal
> life, they open another to everlasting existence. They will
> shine resplendently like a morning star in all the worlds
> of God and, even on earth, their fame shall be exalted,
> their mention magnificent and their fortune vast. The
> spiritual fragrance wafted from their direction will be a
> sweet perfume. Consider how vast is the difference,
> which is why it has been revealed, “And repute not those
> slain on God’s path to be dead. Nay, alive with their Lord, are
they richly sustained.”478

This sanctified soul, the honored Áqá Shaykh ‘Alí-
> Akbar, embraced the Faith some time ago and attained
> certitude. He was instrumental in guiding others as well.
> He traveled frequently to Iran, Caucasus and India and,
> in most instances, left behind radiant evidences and
> enrolled others under the banner of the Cause. The end
> of his life was musk-laden. With the utmost sanctity,
> purity and attraction to God, thrilled by divine promises
> and enflamed by the love of God, he drank from the

> What a hallowed personage he was! Blessed were he and

> revealed, “Those that seek martyrdom in God’s path do so by the
> grace of God. He bestoweth upon whosoever He willeth and is the
possessor of great bounties.”

Out of divine bounty and favor, I implore that we

‘Abdu’l-Bahá telegraphed the following cable: “Mashhad. Mírzá
Ahmad Qa’iní. May My life be a sacrifice unto ‘Alí-Akbar. I am well and in
good health. ‘Abbás.”480

I remember that some years earlier the late Shaykh ‘Alí-Akbar
had come from India to ‘Akká and had brought an Indian traveler
with him. One day in Bahjí, with His own hands, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
prepared Quzi-pulau for lunch and served each one of the friends in
attendance, including this Indian traveler. He quickly ate some of the
meat, but it was not long thereafter that he had to leave the room
and vomit his lunch. It then became clear that after his conversion
to the Faith, he had broken with two of his past practices: sea
journey and eating meat. Apparently his stomach was not used to
meat, which forced his vomiting. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “If
someone is not used to eating meat and not accustomed to it, and
passes by a butcher shop, then the foul odor of the meat will harm
him and he will become ill. But those that regularly eat meat do not
sense this odor. In consideration of the fact that people have
developed the habit of eating meat and by now are used to it, the
Blessed Beauty did not prohibit meat eating, but man is not created
carnivorous.”

Similarly in another instance it was noted:481

479 This verse is an allusion to the Qur’án 86:17, “Deal calmly therefore with the infidels;
give them awhile alone.”
480 A picture of Áqá Shaykh ‘Alí-Akbar Quchání is on the page opposite the first

page of the Star of the West, 13 July 1915.
481 Khátirát Habíb, vol. 1, p. 414 (297) offers an Arabic paragraph, presumably

Regarding the eating of animal flesh and abstinence
> therefrom, know thou of a certainty that, in the beginning of
> creation, God determined the food of every living being, and to eat
> contrary to that determination is not approved. For instance, beasts
> of prey, such as the wolf, lion and leopard, are endowed with
> ferocious, tearing instruments, such as hooked talons and claws.
> From this it is evident that the food of such beasts is meat. If they
> were to attempt to graze, their teeth would not cut the grass, neither
> could they chew the cud, for they do not have molars. Likewise,
> God hath given to the four-footed grazing animals such teeth as
> reap the grass like a sickle, and from this we understand that the
> food of these species of animal is vegetable. They cannot chase and
> hunt down other animals. The falcon hath a hooked beak and
> sharp talons; the hooked beak prevents him from grazing, therefore
his food also is meat.

But now coming to man, we see he hath neither hooked teeth
> or sharp nails or claws, or teeth like iron sickles. From this it
> becomes evident and manifest that the food of man is cereals and
> fruit. Some of the teeth of man are like millstones to grind the
> grain, and some are sharp to cut the fruit. Therefore he is not in
> need of meat, nor is he obliged to eat it. Even without eating meat
> he would live with the utmost vigor and energy. For example, the
> community of the Brahmins in India does not eat meat;
> notwithstanding this they are not inferior to other nations in
> strength, power, vigor, outward senses or intellectual virtues. Truly,
> the killing of animals and the eating of their meat is somewhat
> contrary to pity and compassion, and if one can content oneself with
> cereals, fruit, oil and nuts, such as pistachios, almonds and so on,
> it would undoubtedly be better and more pleasing.

representing ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s words. However, it appears to be a summary of an
unidentified Persian Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that appears in The Compilation of
Compilations 1:1028. Therefore, the Arabic paragraph has been replaced with a
translation of this previously published Tablet.

Extract 21: On Monday, 6 Muharram 1333 AH [24 November
1914], Áqá Mírzá Núri’d-Dín Zayn came from ‘Akká to Abu Sinan. I
asked him, “Since you just returned from the Master’s presence,
what news do you have? What did He talk about?” He replied,
“Today ‘Abdu’l-Bahá told amazing stories regarding the World War
and the proclamation of jihád by the Muslims, and He remarked, ‘If
the Covenant-breakers had not frustrated My efforts, I would have
assembled some of the Muslim and Christian chiefs and exhorted
them to disallow internal conflict [in the nation]. However, the
violators of the Covenant resisted and blocked Me.’ He also related,
‘Once at a wedding in ‘Akká, when the bridal party reached the
residence of the groom, as is customary, the Arabs played fencing
games as they chanted songs in praise of the Blessed Beauty. They
sang:

O Bahá’u’lláh, Thou art the sovereign of the land and sea,

Thou art the ruler of the Arabs and Persians
Thou art the king of Damascus,

Sovereignty is deserving of Thee.

As they sang, a number of soldiers were sitting next to Me, who did
not dare protest and only spoke in affirmation of the songs.
Consider the influence [of Bahá’u’lláh]! What troubles we endured
during the reign of [Sultán] ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd, but they passed. The
present way is agreeable as well. Alas, the Covenant-breakers did not
allow it and ruined [the opportunity].’ And this is the exact story [as
told by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]:

> There was a certain Mustafá Effendi in charge of the
> newspaper, who persistently caused us difficulties and
> incited people against us, including the Mutasarrif
> Kurdih who had risen with the utmost determination to
> destroy us. The more kindness we showed the
> Mutasarrif, the more he grew in his animosity. One day

> he gathered in his house all the notables, the Qádí
> [judge] and the Muftí of ‘Akká and anyone else who was
> hostile towards us, planning to create great mischief on
that day and to slay and plunder us.

One of the friends of the Mutasarrif, a certain
> Sa‘du’d-Dín Ramadán, who was the chief of the
> merchants, left the gathering in its midst and came to
> our residence. First, he knocked on the door very loudly,
> but I instructed that it should not be opened. He
> persisted in knocking and insisted on entering, saying he
> was carrying an important message and that he only
wished to say a few words and then leave quickly.

Eventually, he was allowed in. Once inside, he
> began to insult and curse the Mutasarrif, while I kept
> silent and did not utter a word. After he had said all he
> wished, he commented, ‘Effendi, it is best if You
> mitigate the tension and make peace with the
> Mutasarrif.’ I replied, ‘Peace? That is an excellent and
> most wonderful idea, but how?’ He said, ‘The
> Mutasarrif’s purpose is money. That is what he wants. It
> is best if You do not deny him and give him some
> money.’ I remarked, ‘Very well, that is easy. Wait till I go
> get some.’ Sa‘du’d-Dín Ramadán was thrilled, thinking
that I was about to go fetch a bag of gold coins.

Instead, I went inside, performed My ablutions and
> stood for prayer. With the utmost concentration and
> reverence, I offered two repetitions of the obligatory
> prayer, and afterwards recited a long prayer. Meanwhile,
> Sa‘du’d-Dín Ramadán was becoming impatient and I
> could hear him say, ‘Hurry, Effendi! Hurry, Effendi!’ He
> was in a great hurry, growing impatient, as he had
> promised his friends he would return quickly, which is
> why he was insisting that I should hurry and give him
> the money. However, with great deliberation, I was
engaged in prayer. He kept pleading for Me to make

haste, saying, ‘Hurry, Effendi, it is best not to delay this
matter!’ I asked, ‘Which matter?’ He replied, ‘The issue
of the money!’ ‘The money was sent a while ago. Why
are you here?’ I told him. ‘How was it sent? By whom
was it sent?’ he inquired. I said, ‘By now it has reached
the Mutasarrif. Go quickly!’

He rose and began to put on his shoes; and, when
he turned back towards Me, I slapped him hard and was
about to slap him again, but he fled and went to the
Mutasarrif who had inquired, ‘Why did it take you so
long? Where is the money?’ He replied, ‘By God, I went
to them, but all I received was a hard beating. Look, my
face is still quite red! These people are very tough!’

This incident further deepened the enmity, rancor,
animosity and hatred of the Mutasarrif who arose with
the utmost determination and haste to cause us injury.
Instead, he received a telegram dismissing him and his
entire administration – both religious and secular – from
office. Until then, it was unheard of that a whole
municipal administration should be dismissed at once
and without exception.

The Mutasarrif discovered the source of his
troubles, so he sent the Muftí with a thousand liras to
Beirut, charging him to present the gift to the Valí with a
request for a new post. The Muftí proceeded to Beirut;
but, when the Valí learned that he was carrying a gift of a
thousand liras for him, he became very angry and did not
allow the Mutfí to sit in his presence, and instead had
him stripped of the thousand liras and thrown into
prison.

From Beirut, the Muftí wrote Me. <300> He
appealed in the Name of the Blessed Beauty, so I would
intercede on his behalf: He had written, “By His
Threshold.” When I saw the misery and wretchedness
that had befallen him, I agreed to release him. In utter

> despair and gloom, he returned to ‘Akká, but everyone
> abandoned him. Eventually he came to Me, fell at My
> feet and expressed his regret and remorse. I lifted him up
> and forgave him. I then wrote to the Valí, who was
> Nusvahíy Bey, recommended him, and said that he had
> not perpetrated any harm or injury against us. In short,
> this Muftí, whose name was Shaykh ‘Alí Mírí, embraced
the Faith.482

Soon thereafter, the Mutasarrif also came to Me,
> threw himself on the ground and pleaded for
> forgiveness. He implored, ‘This evil man, Mustafá
> Effendi, the newspaper editor, was the perpetrator of all
> the mischief and machinations!’483 After him came
> Mustafá Effendi asking for forgiveness and expressing
> his regret. He claimed it was the Mutasarrif who had
> caused the conflict and that, ‘It was he, this greedy man,
> who brought about these events. I was a mere
servant.’484

Not long thereafter, orders were issued for the
> Mutasarrif to be exiled to Damascus. I paid all his
> expenses in that city as well as for his family in ‘Akká.
> After three months, I sent his family to him in
Damascus and paid for their journey.

In short, Mustafá Effendi was the one who caused
> and provoked the Mutasarrif into enmity towards us and
> continued to oppose us to the point that he wanted to
> forcibly seize the residence of the Blessed Beauty in
> ‘Akká because of its refreshing climate and pleasant
> view. He continued with his harassment and wrote a
> complaint to Constantinople, claiming: “The Blessed

482 It was because of the pleading of this Muftí that Bahá’u’lláh agreed to leave the
city of ‘Akká for the Mansion of Mazra‘ih; see Hasan Balyuzi, Bahá’u’lláh, the King of
Glory, pp. 358-359, 361 and Hasan Balyuzi, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, pp. 40-1.
483 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá quotes him in Arabic.
484 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá quotes him in Arabic.

> Beauty and his followers are mischief-makers. They
> interfere in matters of politics, have gained immense
> influence, and, therefore, I wish to seize the center of
this sedition (meaning the house of Bahá’u’lláh).”485

They sent investigators to ‘Akká, including the
> secretary of Beirut’s Valí. It so happened that prior to
> their arrival, I met the secretary [of the Valí of Beirut] in
> a gathering, and, in the course of conversation, he asked,
> “What is the difference between ‘In the Name of God,
> the Compassionate, the Merciful’ and ‘In the Name of
> the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.’” I explained
> the station of divinity and prophethood in detail. He was
> absolutely astounded and enchanted with these
> expositions and explanations. Afterwards in Turkish I
> wrote a short letter to the Valí of Beirut, Nusvahíy Bey,
> alerting him to more closely mind the situation of ‘Akká.
> The Valí issued immediate instructions for an
> investigation, in the course of which, much corruption in
the administration of ‘Akká was discovered.486

And this was the account of Mutasarrif Kurdih,
Mustafá Effendi and their collaborators.

Extract 22: In 1927, when I attained the presence of the Guardian
of the Cause of God – may my spirit be a sacrifice unto him –
mention of Iran was made. He stated, “There is a Text in the blessed
handwriting of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, but it is not known for whom it was
revealed. I give you a photocopy to take to Iran so that the friends
of God will behold it and become aware of the future of Iran.” That
Text is as follows:

A thousand years must pass ere Iran can by the aid of
485Ottoman law prohibited political dissent and agitation for civil liberties.
486Hasan Balyuzi, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, pp. 115-116 suggests this incident occurred during
the time of Bahá’u’lláh.

> material means gain parity with the peoples and the governments of
> Europe. Bahá’u’lláh, however, has illumined Iran and will raise
> her high in the eyes of the entire world. That country shall so
> advance as to excite the envy and admiration of the East and the
West.

The land of Hijáz, though deserted and sterile in its soil
> and its tribes in the depth of ignorance, savagery and perversion, yet
> the power of the Cause of God transformed it to become the Qiblih
of the world and the focal-center of the planet’s devotion.

The people of the East are presently unaware that they have
> incarcerated for well-nigh fifty years the like of that glorious
> Personage! But for His chains and prison, Bahá’u’lláh by this time
> would have gained ascendancy over the thoughts of the peoples of
> Europe, would have made of Iran the garden of Paradise, would
> have made Iran distinguished before all of mankind, nay He would
> have made her such that all peoples and governments would seek
enlightenment from that land.

Consider the results of my few days’ stay in London and the
> profound effect it has had there and in the surrounding regions.
> Ponder then, what the coming of Bahá’u’lláh would have achieved.
> Had He appeared in Europe, its people would have seized their
> opportunity, and His Cause, by virtue of the freedom of thought,
> would by this time have compassed the earth. But alas! This
> Cause, though it first appeared in Iran, yet eventually it shall be
> seen how the peoples of Europe have wrested it from the hand of
> Iran and Iranians. Take note of this and remember it in the
> future. Ultimately you shall see how it has come to pass. And yet
> behold! how the Bahá’ís are sill slain by the people of Iran!487

Extract 23: [A Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, likely revealed in the fourth
quarter of 1914:]

487   A slight modification of a translation in The Bahá’í World, vol. 3, p. 75.

returned to America.

Convey ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s warmest greetings to all the firm
believers and upon you rest the Glory of God, the Most Glorious.

Extract 24: On Thursday, 4 December 1914, at the beginning of
my stay in the village of Abu Sinan, I was summoned to ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s presence alone in ‘Akká and He spoke the following words.
He also gave me a mission that required going to Beirut by way of
Damascus. The Master remarked:

> Áqá Mírzá Habíb, we have already given you many
> burdens and now another task must be entrusted to you.
> What can we do! Proceed to Beirut by way of Damascus
> and bring back a check. (The check was sent by Áqá

Bulgaria, March 1954.

However, regarding your own situation: The

Extract 25: In response to a letter from one of the American
friends who had complained of loneliness, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote:

O believer in God! Thy letter arrived, and therein thou had
> complained of lonesomeness. Do not be sad. You are not alone;
> God is your companion and your friend. Lonely is the one who is
> distant from God. But if one is aware of God, though he be in the
> midmost-heart of a vast and desolate desert, he is not alone: God is
with him.

This world of soil always has a dark sky, filled with black

> attached to this world but instead will discover ease and comfort in
the heavenly realm and the celestial kingdom.

Therefore thou must be joyous and glad because of the divine
promises. Upon thee rest the Glory of God, the Most Glorious.

Extract 26: In a Tablet addressed to one of the believers in
Bádkúbih, it is revealed [by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá]:

O flower of the orchard of His Holiness Christ! When
> Christ – may My spirit be a sacrifice unto Him – appeared
> heavenly with a brilliant Visage and a beauteous Countenance
> amidst the Jews, the Israelites believed that, out of divine
> beneficence, their land had become a flower garden. However it
> became clear and manifest that it was still naught but a barren
> wasteland, save for a few that, out of the favors of the Holy Spirit,
> emerged verdant and fresh like blossoms. Indeed they were the
flowers and fruits of His Holiness Moses.

Now, in the orchard of Christ, you too are a lovely and
> enchanting flower, and by the grace of Spring, shine with the utmost
> refinement and beauty. Render thanks unto God that you have
> witnessed the effulgence of the Kingdom of Mystery. I cherish the
> hope that you will diffuse these must-laden mysteries throughout the
> world. Praise be to God that, rank upon rank, the bounties of the
> Kingdom of Light have shone forth and the [true] spirit and being
> have been rescued from all veils and vain imaginings. If you desire
> illumined eyes, fragrant nostrils and a heart made resplendent by
> the bounties of the Holy Spirit, then know the merits of this mighty
> beneficence and gracious favor, and by heavenly strength, celestial
> tokens and divine confirmations, proceed to guide others.

Extract 27: In one of His Tablets, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá speaks of
believing and non-believing women:

Since they failed to recognize the Truth, the ladies of the
> world were reduced to maidservants, and the handmaidens of the
> Blessed Beauty, through the bounties of the Ancient Beauty,
> became the foremost ladies of the world. The proof of this is Shírín,
> the queen of Iran, or Sudabeh, the Zoroastrian, another of her
> queens, or similarly the Queen Victoria, the Great, or Isabella, the

> queen of Spain, through whose efforts America was discovered and
> conquered, or Empress Fran Eugenie490, who became one with the
> soil. They were exalted, but became maidservants; renowned, but
> were reduced to the black earth. However, Ásiyyih, Sarah, Mary,
> Fátimih and Táhirih, though outwardly poor, won the everlasting
throne of glory.

Consequently, it is evident that the great ladies of the world
> were reduced to handmaids, while the maidservants of the Blessed
> Beauty gained exaltation and glory. Therefore render thanks that,
> praise unto God, you are associated with this sacred Threshold and
> rank among the divine handmaidens.

<305> Extract 28: In a Tablet to the friends in Tiflis, [‘Abdu’l-
Bahá] revealed:

You had expressed joy over ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s return to Haifa
> and ‘Akká. Indeed, for some time, because of the burden of the
> journey to the West and the weight of sorrowful trials, My being

490Maria Eugenia Ignacia Augustina de Guzman y Palafox was born on 5 May 1826
in Grenada, Spain, but spent much of her life in Farnborough, Hampshire. In 1849
she met Napoleon III, the Emperor of France, and in 1853 they were married.
Three years later they had a son named Napoleon Eugene Louis Jean Joseph -
Prince Imperial and heir to the Napoleon Empire. In 1870 France declared war on
Prussia and Louis went to war with his father. At the battle of Sedan Napoleon III
was captured but Louis was helped to escape. Following the war, there was a revolt
in Paris and Eugenie was forced to flee. The Emperor was eventually released and
joined his family at Camden Place in Kent where he died in 1873. Two years later,
his son, Louis, passed away. In 1881, Empress Eugenie bought the mansion at
Farnborough Hill and greatly expanded it. She died in 1920 and is laid to rest
alongside her husband and son in the Imperial Crypt of the Abbey Church.

Extract 29: On 28 July 1914 a Tablet was revealed in honor of
Reverend [J. W.] Van Kirk, the American priest who had twice
circled the globe and presented a seven-color standard, signifying
the Most Great Peace, to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:491

> O thou respected truth seeker!

Thy letter was received. It reflected the sentiment of the

I have great affection towards you and was delighted with
our meeting; cherishing the hope that we will meet again.

Extract 30: After a journey to Beirut in fulfillment of a mission
which included meeting with the students and the friends, I returned
to ‘Akká. I was summoned forthwith to the presence of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá, Who remarked: “Marhabá, you are welcomed, marhabá! Truly
you carried a great burden. God has created us for service to others,
but if a person is detached and devoted, then for him, comfort is
pain and service like great ease.” He inquired of the students and I
said, “Through Your favors and grace they are well. In one of their
gatherings it was suggested that a missive be submitted expressing
their praise and gratitude for Your manifold bounties, but the
majority thought that this very act would express vanity and ego and

therefore decided against it.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá smiled. I said, “One of
the friends has asked in a letter, ‘Where is the Master presently?’” He
responded, “In front of a cannon, in front of a cannon!”

I reported on the Iranian students in Beirut and Professor
Chirdagh494, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá inquired, “Are there many [non-
Bahá’í] Iranians in Beirut?” I replied, “Most have gone, and only a
few remain.” He remarked, “It is good that they leave as they are the
cause of much embarrassment!”

I said, “Mr. Zimmer, one of the believers of Stuttgart, has
been killed on the battlefield.” The Master replied, “Indeed, the
harm of this World War has reached us too. One of the French
Bahá’ís, Monsieur Bernard, was killed as well. If there was one
person in the world who despised war, it was he.”

In the midst of this conversation, an Arab entered and said,
“Áqá Mihdí’s cow has died, and I implore You to intervene with
Áqá Mihdí so he will not charge me for the cost.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
remarked, “I am poor like you. If you have to win bread for two
people, I have to shoulder the expenses of at least fifty people! I am
neither a landlord, nor a merchant, nor a financier, nor do I have an
income. All roads are closed, and none have been left open to us. I
am but a stranger. Each year I would give away to the needy two or
three hundred sets of clothing, but this year affairs have been so
perturbed that I have not succeeded in giving even one.
Nevertheless, take this money and buy food, sweets and other
necessities for your family. I will do my best as well.”

Extract 31: 31 December 1914: Before the noon hour, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá was pacing in the garden and this ephemeral servant was in
attendance.

> “To what should I devote my time in Abu Sinan?” I asked.

“I wish for you to go to Iran,” the Master replied. “Presently,
however, remain in Abu Sinan and for the good-pleasure of God

cure the ailing. Also read from the proof treatise as well as Ishráqát,
Kalimát [Firdawsíyyih] and Tarázát, and memorize them.”

> “Should I also tend to the non-Bahá’ís?” I asked.

“Yes, indeed,” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked, “We too are devoted to the
poor. By all means, attend to all, particularly the needy.”

I remarked, “Áqá Shaykh Badríu’d-Dín has said, ‘Shaykhu’l-Islám
wants to proclaim jihád!’”

The Master replied, “Shaykhu’l-Islám is a simple, common man
with no religious convictions. He is utterly ignorant of the religion of
God. Jihád had an effect at a time when people were devoted to
God’s Faith, but now that spirit is completely gone. They themselves
do not believe what they say. They claim this issue is a global war
and jihád must be a matter of national concern. If in truth these
people believed in religion, by now the world would have become
the Abhá paradise. If you offer them a bribe, they would say the
exact opposite of what they ruled earlier. No trace of spirit, sincerity,
faith, certitude or firmness has remained in Islam. Only mere words
have survived.”

At lunchtime in the house of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, He remarked: “I
have always created work for Myself and this long journey has
greatly dissipated My vitality and tired My nerves. Now the bounty
of rest has been forced upon Me. Although during these days I
continue to remain active, but it is not like before. God has brought
about these events so that I may rest a little and be at ease. Now My
health is good and I shall sleep well.”495

Convey my heartfelt greetings to all the friends. Upon you

antipathy and hatred!”
Today the life of mankind and its attainment to everlasting

glory depend on its display of effort and exertion in accordance with
the principles of his holiness Bahá’u’lláh; for His first and foremost
teaching consists of the oneness of the world of humanity. He says:
“We are all the sheep of God. His Highness, the Almighty, is the
real Shepherd and is kind to all the sheep. Why then should we be
unkind toward each other?” Another of his most great principles
deals with the subject of universal peace, the establishment of which
would be conducive to the well-being, progress and tranquility of the
world of man.

Other precepts of Bahá’u’lláh address the identity of the
underlying foundations of the religions of God, the original oneness
of the nations, the adoption and general practice of a universal
auxiliary language and the inculcation of the ideal of
cosmopolitanism and world-patriotism among the children of men;
consequently, in the future, His teachings will act as a deterrent
and prevention from the occurrence of the most great danger, i.e.,
universal war.

Today the most important object of the Kingdom of God is
the promulgation of the cause of universal peace and the principle of
the oneness of the world of humanity. Upon whomsoever arises in
the accomplishment of this pre-eminent service will descend the
confirmations of the Holy Spirit.

Now, all that has been predicted has come to pass, and the
lurid flames of this war have emblazoned the horizon of the East
and the West, causing a reverberating social earthquake throughout
the foundations of the earth. After this war, the workers for this
cause of universal peace will increase day by day; the pacific party,
with a better advantage, will array its forces, displaying great
activity; and in the end, it will gain a permanent triumph and
eternal victory over all other parties. The realization of this matter
is incontestable and irrefutable.

Therefore, ere long, a vast and unlimited field will be opened
before your view for the display of your powers and energies. You
must promote this glorious intention with heavenly power and the
confirmations of the Holy Spirit. I am praying on thy behalf that

> thou mayest erect a pavilion and unfurl a flag in the world of peace,
love and eternal life.

I beg you to accept the consideration of my highest and
deepest respect.

Extract 34: [A Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Dr. Howard Bliss, the
President of the American University of Beirut:]

Extract 35: Together with all the pilgrims and some of the resident
believers, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá went to visit the Shrine of the Báb.
Afterwards, He spoke of the hardships suffered during the early
days of the Dispensation and the afflictions perpetrated upon the
497 A modification of the translation on 1 May 1915 by Mírzá Ahmad Sohrab,
printed in Star of the West, vol 6, no. 11, pp 82-3.

Blessed Beauty. As He spoke, tears, like spring showers, began to
pour forth from His eyes. From His condition, all the listeners were
profoundly moved and affected. He said, “During the entire time
that His Holiness the Exalted One [the Báb] – may My spirit be a
sacrifice unto Him – was confined in Mah-Kú, He did not have any
light and spent His nights in total darkness.”

After the friends had taken their seat, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá continued
remarking:

Praised be God that under the shadow of the
> bounties of the Ancient Beauty such heavenly gatherings
> are now held. Presently the benefits of these assemblages
> are not evident. If a person is endowed with the least
> equity or discernment, he would understand how
> immense and prevailing is the might of the Blessed
Beauty. Outwardly, His sovereignty is manifest.

At the beginning of our arrival at ‘Akká, we had
> gatherings, but very secretly. None of the pilgrims were
> permitted entrance into the city. They would be
> discovered by the gate and would be made the subject of
> contempt, and then banished away. The honored Nabíl
> came by the city’s gate and fell into trouble. They would

God.

Extract 36: [‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked:]

> desert, yet it is sought after with great joy and bliss.
> Praised be God that this realm is perfect in every respect:

Extract 37: ‘Abdu’l-Bahá related:

the mountain and some other buildings raised by the
Germans. No political threat is involved.” They sent this
report to Mutasarrif, who in turn forwarded it to the
Qá’im-maqám. However, the latter rejected it and
insisted that the issue be investigated directly from
Constantinople. [Upon their approval], he said, he would
issue the permit.

<315> They wrote to Constantinople and stated,
“‘Abdu’l-Bahá is planning to built a Shrine for the Báb.”
Soon the issue became enormously important since
[Sultán] ‘Abdu’l-Hamíd was our determined enemy and
was constantly vigilant for an opportunity [to cause
harm].

I decided that in whatever way possible I should
win the approval of the Qá’im-maqám. I tried very hard.
He said, “I have no enmity and only fear accepting a
responsibility that might bring me difficulty.” I asked,
“What difficulty?” He said, “Difficulties that I am aware
of.” I pressed, “What harm is in this undertaking?” He
replied, “Harms that I am aware of.” Together we left
his office and he said that we should walk to his
residence, perchance he would reconsider and I would
attain our purpose. We reached his house, and I noticed
that his mind had remained the same. We entered the
building and, as he began to walk up the stairs, by the
time he reached the third stair, he collapsed and died. I
called out, “O Qá’im-maqám, O Qá’im-maqám, O
Qá’im-maqám!” but it was of no use since he was dead.
“There is no rejoicing in another’s death.”

Thereupon I began the construction work. There
was no access road to the Shrine of the Báb, and as the
existing pathway was dreadful, I decided on building an
access road. However, the owner [of the strip of land],
provoked by the enemies of the Cause, would not give
consent. Eventually, after two months of striving, he

> agreed, but the Qurdachi who was working for the

> immediately responded, “Fine, you can have the trees!”
> Then he said, “You must partition the land with a

> encroached.” I replied, “If you want, I am prepared to

> Once more he withdrew and said, “I will not consent
> until you bring a reliable surety. For instance, I will
> consent if Sádiq Páshá504 serves as Your guarantor. I will
> give my consent then and will no longer withhold
permission.”

We agreed to meet at the home of Sádiq Páshá. At

505 Ustád Muhammad-‘Alí was a builder from Yazd and, for many years, lived in the
Holy Land. With his melodious voice, he often chanted prayers or Bahá’u’lláh’s
Mathnaví in the presence of the Master. (HM)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá then added, “I know that which will soon be.”509

Extract 38: Jamál Páshá was one of the bloodthirsty and reckless
military generals of the Ottoman realm. For nearly a year, he worked
to assemble the necessary provisions to attack the Suez Canal and
conquer the region of Nile [Egypt]. As a consequence, almost half of
the population of the Ottoman Empire suffered bitterly and lost all
their possessions and livelihood. Forcibly, he confiscated all the
belongings of the helpless under the pretext of “war expenditures.”
His most notable trademark was that when he entered a city, he
would raise gallows, execute anyone that offered the least resistance
to his tyranny and thereby advance his heinous and ignominious
goals. Constantly the Covenant-breakers would provoke him and
sow the seeds of doubt in him, to the point that, at public
gatherings, Jamál Páshá had promised to eradicate and expunge the
Cause and sunder ‘Abdu’l-Bahá into two pieces. However, God
protected His Cause, and this savage man failed in his campaign in
the Suez Canal. He was eventually killed in the Caucasus by
Armenian revolutionaries.

The following two historical extracts appear in my diaries and

are recorded herewith. “Take notice, O men of understanding.”

Jamál Páshá – First Extract: Wherever the ruthless and irresponsible
Jamál Páshá went, he would, before all else, raise the gallows and
execute anyone he desired. He would then perpetrate whatever else
he wished. He was not afraid to plunder, destroy, bombard and kill.
Because he had often heard ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s blessed name and saw
many reports about Him, when he arrived in ‘Akká, he summoned
the Master. Riding His donkey, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá went to his military
tent. Jamál Páshá greeted Him, came close and invited the Master to
come sit near him. Then he immediately roared, “You are a religious
mischief-maker and, for this reason, the government has exiled
You.” Later, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would relate, “I realized that he was
drunk and prideful to such a point that if a chain or a piece of metal
was handed to him, he would tear it apart. Therefore, I thought that
since he was a Turk, it was best for me to reply in such a way that
would make him laugh and would also, of necessity, quiet him. I
replied to him, ‘There are two kinds of troublemakers: Political and
religious. (Then before the audience I pointed to him and
continued:) Praised be God that so far no harm has come from the
political mischief-makers. (During the reign of [Sultán] ‘Abdu’l-
Hamíd, Jamál Páshá was known as a political troublemaker.)
Inshá’lláh, no harm will come from this religious mischief-maker.’
With that, Jamál Páshá burst into loud laughter and joyfully said, ‘By
God, You are right!’”

He then asked ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “Who has built the German
Colony?” The Master replied, “The grandfather of the present
German Consul was living in Haifa, and he inaugurated a religion
that prophesizes the near-return of Christ. They built this colony so
that when Christ reappeared, they would succeed in attaining His
presence.” With utmost anger and fury, Jamál Páshá responded, “A
new religion? If he was alive I would instantly order his death.” For
a few minutes everyone was silent. Then Jamál Páshá asked, “What
is the cause of the Ottoman Empire’s weakness?” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
responded, “The existence of diverse religions.” He asked, “What is

the remedy?” The Master replied, “That the leaders of all religions
and denominations existing within the Ottoman Empire and Islamic
lands gather in Constantinople and, after consultations, agree on a
single and unifying religion.” Once more, Jamál Páshá said, “By
God, You are right!”

[Thus through the Master’s logical conclusion,] the Páshá’s
anger and enmity subsided, and he expressed a desire for a second
meeting. <320> He said, “I am now proceeding to Egypt to
conquer that region and to drive the enemy into the sea and the
Suez Canal. After my return, I will take You to Constantinople.
There I will gather the religious leaders and force them into unity
and agreement in one religion. Here Your station is not evident!”

[Jamál Páshá – Second Extract:] Of the pride and vanity of Jamál
Páshá, prior to his arrival in Haifa, without disclosing the number of
men accompanying him, he merely telegraphed the Mutasarrif,
“Tonight, I am arriving in Haifa.” The Mutasarrif ordered dinner
preparations for forty to fifty people, but, when Jamál Páshá arrived,
he had four hundred men with him. Angrily, he protested to the
Mutasarrif, “Do you expect my soldiers to go to bed with no
dinner?” With great difficulty and haste, the Mutasarrif and his
attendants prepared dinner for the soldiers, which was subsequently
served by midnight.

When Jamál Páshá arrived in Jerusalem, through the repeated
provocations of the Covenant-breakers and the enmity of a certain
Yásín, the investigator, he was thoroughly agitated [against the
Faith], promising, “If I conquer Egypt soon, on my return I will
crucify ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.” Mockingly, he added, “I will obey the wish of
‘Abbás Effendi: death by hanging or death by firing squad.
Whichever He selects, I will carry out.” The German Consul had
come before the Master saying, “I am deeply saddened. I am very
frightened and worried. Jamál Páshá has promised that on the way

back he will crucify You and he has sent instructions for me to keep
an eye on You until his return.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá replied, “This issue is
not a cause of sorrow or worry. Very well, I have no problem with
his plan. However, he has conditioned his action by the word ‘if.’
That is, he had said, ‘if’ he returns victorious, if he is triumphant in
the Egyptian campaign, and if he forces the British into the Suez
Canal. If he is successful, then I too am ready and willing to give My
life.”

Two days later the German Consul came into the Master’s
presence in great haste and once more expressed his concerns and
anxieties. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá inquired of the cause of his apprehensions,
and the German replied, “Yesterday, the army of Jamál Páshá was
fighting hand to hand with the British near the Suez Canal. But
today, his telegraph came from Ba’ru’s-Sab‘. The fact that he is so
far away from the battlefield is greatly confusing and agitating for
me.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “This is a very simple matter, and you
should not be distressed. I will explain it to you. When the Páshá
confronted the British forces, he must have found them able
adversaries. Therefore, he fled the scene and with great haste
reached Ba’ru’s-Sab‘.” The German Consul pondered this comment
for a minute and then said, “Yes, I believe You must be correct.
There can be no other explanation.”511

Afterwards, Jamál Páshá perished and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked,
“The wise perceive the ends of deeds, but foolish see only the
present. Verily, I did not heed Jamál Páshá, as I was aware of his
end.”

Extract 39: [‘Abdu’l-Bahá remarked:]

abode.”

Soon he was martyred.

Extract 40:513 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke in Arabic; the following is the
essence of His remarks:

> Consider the foolishness of the governments of Iran and
> the Ottoman Empire in how they banished His Holiness
512 He was the general in charge of the Shah’s armies against Quddús and other Bábí
besiegers.

A gathering in 1919 (Shoghi Effendi is seated, 2nd from R)

Extract 41: [‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s remarks about] the Holy Land:515

degrees below zero and in the summer as high as 38.

When a person journeys through Syria and the

here in the mild atmosphere of the western part.

The distance between the hottest point, which is

from the hottest to the coldest point.

This land is preferred over the rest of the world,

they discovered that there was no land like or equal to it.

When Abraham was exiled from His home, God

Abraham.

The Holy Land is the center of light and the

Extract 44: [Not translated in the present edition.]

Extract 45: In New York, Denur, the manager of one of the
hotels, had become attracted [to the Cause] and, having attaining the
presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, implored the Master to stay at his hotel,
even without payment. Because of his insistence and invitation,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá went. While there, a Catholic priest entered the
premises and spoke in such way that caused the manager to have a
change of heart. Thereupon the Master left the hotel and departed
for Washington. [While there,] the Master spoke in churches and
Jewish synagogues on the validity of Christ and Muhammad. This
fueled the enmity of the priests. They published certain polemics,
calling ‘Abdu’l-Bahá “the false prophet and antichrist.” One cardinal
even followed the Master to Denur. The cardinal traveled under the
pretext of inaugurating a new church; in reality, his intention was to
assail the Cause, for he spoke against it. The Master remarked:

I heard that here they have had a great religious
> procession with much pomp and ceremony: a procession
> the likes of which has not been seen before. This
> ceremony of the honored cardinal is like that of Christ’s
> in Jerusalem. However, there is a slight difference. In
> Christ’s divine ceremony, He had a crown, but it was
> made of thorns, while this cardinal wears a crown
> adorned with lustrous jewels. Christ had garments, but
> they were torn, while in this ceremony, the cardinal’s
> robe is made of the finest brocade. In that ceremony,
> those that followed Christ were objects of [people’s]
> contempt and abuse, while those that were with cardinal
> walked in great honor, pomp and glory. Christ was the
> target of people’s insults and harm. In this procession,
> people showered the cardinal with their praise, salutation
> and support. Christ’s procession was the manifestation
> of humility, reverence, hardship, spirituality and divine
> attraction, while the cardinal’s is the display of might,
> wealth and power. Christ’s throne was upon a cross,
> while this cardinal’s place is upon a much adorned
pulpit. So, there are some differences!

Consider how ignorant and neglectful people are.

> They say what a wonderful procession this was. Christ
> spent His days in sorrow, sustaining every manner of
> trial, tribulation, hardship and affliction. Day and night,
> single and alone, He roamed in the deserts, His food
> being no more than weeds and thorns of the field. His
> night’s lamps were the stars of heaven, and in daytime
> He walked in solitude. Now, these honored gentlemen,
> in utmost majesty and grandeur, live in the most
> splendid mansions, enjoying their comfort and claiming
> to be the Disciples of Christ. A disciple must follow the
> example of his master so that all his deeds and ways
> reflect that of the master. But these men have immense
estates, with immense endowments and properties. They

> spend their days and nights in lust, deprived of the
> slightest breath of detachment manifested by Christ.516

The aforementioned cardinal stopped his opposition and
remained silent.

Extract 46: On 9 May 1915, I was alone in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
presence and most of His discourse was about the many qualities
and services of the German believers. I thought it propitious, out of
my fidelity to them, to ask the Master, “For some time now, the
German Bahá’ís have had no news of Your blessed well-being, nor
are they informed of the occurrences in the Holy Land. In the past,
they have always benefited from Your sanctified confirmations and
presently the postal services are functioning. Therefore, if it is Your
august will and should a Tablet may be revealed for them, it can
readily be forwarded to uplift their spirits and gladden their hearts.”
Immediately the following Tablet was revealed and sent for them:

German Bahá’ís, may their lives be filled with gladness.

O true friends! Although for a while no letters have been
> sent in your direction, be assured that you are always in my
> thoughts. I supplicate the confirmations of the Kingdom of God for

> gates of the Kingdom are flung wide open; the melodies of the Lord
of Hosts enthrall the spirit.

The glad news of the German friends are received, and
> praised be God that you manifest the utmost firmness and fidelity,
> and remain attracted to the Kingdom of the Lord. I cherish the
> hope that the efficacy of the Holy Spirit will transform that realm

516   A different version of this talk is given in Mahmud’s Diary, pp. 356-357.

be revived and refreshed.

Convey my utmost affection to each one of the friends. Upon
you rest praise and salutations.

Extract 47: While in the Holy Land, the gardener of the Ridván
Garden, the honored Abú’l-Qásim Yazdí, bestowed on me the gift
of a pocket notebook containing many Tablets addressed to him and
his family. For many years this believer served in the Ridván Garden,
tending to the flowers and orchards, and striving to bring about the
enjoyment and comfort of visitors and pilgrims.

One of his innovations was the way he prevented entrance of
Arabs to the blessed Ridván Garden. Whenever he had gone to
attain the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá or purchase provisions in ‘Akká,
he would lock the entrance gate and would not let anyone open it
until he returned. [On his return], if no one was by the gate and it
seemed safe, he use the code phrase: “Shukkru’lláh”, meaning,
“Thank God that an unwanted person is not by the entrance”, and
they would immediately open the gate and let him in. However, if
there were any undesirable individuals, instead he would yell,
“Hasan, hasan”, signaling for the gate not to be opened, and the
unwanted people would think that he had called on his attendant,
Hasan, who had failed to open the door. In this instance, the word
“hasan”, meant, “They are here,” and would indicate [to those inside
the Garden] that he was accompanied by undesirable elements, who
would wait a while, and when they realized that the gate was not
being opened, leave. By this method, the late Abú’l-Qásim protected
fruits and flowers from the aggression of Arabs.
This illustrious man was tall and well-built, and in one of His

Tablets to Abú’l-Qasim’s brother, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá humorously and in
jest stated, “If you do not testify to his might, consider his mane and mace and
then you would know of certainty that he is either Rustam Tahamtan517 or
Gudarz Lashkár-shikán518.”

In short, in this notebook several important Tablets were
recorded, including the one that named the doors of the Shrine of
the Báb in honor of certain distinguished believers. That Tablet is as
follows:

> A copy of this Tablet should be bestowed upon each of the
> mentioned personages and the original must be kept in the
> Hádiratu’l-Quds519.

O God and my Beloved! Praise be upon Thee for Thy
> greatness and thanks be unto Thee for Thy generosity. Thou
> grantest what Thou dost wish, Thou willest what Thou desirest,
> and enablest whosoever Thou inclinest in whatsoever Thou
> ordainest. All things are in Thy grasp and destiny resides in Thy
> hand. Thou bestowest honor on whomsoever Thou wishest,
> endowest sustenance on anyone Thou desirest and deniest it to
> whom Thou willest. All goods are in Thy hand and Thy station is
> benevolence. Thou art the All-Bountiful, the All-Giving, the

Sháhnamih.
518 Lit. Destroyer of armies; title of mythological Iranian Gudarz Sháh.
519 Lit. paradise, it has a numerical value of 1327, which is the year that the remains

of the Báb were interred in His permanent Shrine. The term Hádiratu’l-Quds is
translated in Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, p.7, as the habitations of holiness. Fadil
Mazandarani (Asráru’l-Áthár, vol. 3, pp. 116-117) notes that this phrase was used in
the writings of Bahá’u’lláh to refer to the innermost Sanctuary of Paradise, and that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the Tablet of Visitation of the Vakílu’d-Dawlih used this expression
as a reference to the Shrine of the Báb on Mount Carmel. This term has been
employed by the Prince Shaykhu’r-Ra’ís in a poem marking the occasion of the
Naw-Rúz 1909 interment of the Báb.

Compassionate, and the Merciful.

A number rose in service of the Hádiratu’l-Quds and with
> utmost devotion and spirit exerted much effort. Some others had
> spiritual attachment and profoundly desired to aid in the labor and
> work of that sacred Shrine. Therefore the water-cistern is named
> after the illustrious Afnán of the sacred Lote-Tree, the honored
> Mírzá Báqir. The first entrance on the eastern side is named the
> Báb-i-Bálá, and the second door on the east named the Báb-i-
> Karím, named after Ustád ‘Abdu’l-Karím. The northern door is
> the Báb-i-Ashraf; and the first door on the western side is to be
> known as the Báb-i-Fadl, while the second on the same side will be
> the Báb-i-Amín. By these names are meant: Áqá ‘Alí Ashraf,
> Áqá Ustád ‘Abdu’l-Karím, Áqá Bálá, the illustrious Abú’l-
> Fadl and the honored Amín. These designations must endure
forever.

Thus the Almighty inspired Me by the earth of the point of
adoration of the Supreme Concourse.

Extract 48: From Germany, I brought a large quantity of missives
from the friends in that realm for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, all testifying to their
readiness for sacrifice, their humility, devotion to the Faith and their
firmness and steadfastness in the divine Covenant and Testament,
and I submitted these to His sacred presence. Although because of
the War all these letters had gone through the censor and had their
postal stamp, nevertheless, several of them were confiscated at the
German border, and a few more were stolen at the Customs in
Alexandria, Egypt. Notwithstanding, I presented the rest to the
Master Who spoke most glowingly in praise and approval of the
German believers, unceasingly showering His admiration and
affection on them, and speaking of the brilliant future of the friends
520 After the completion of Shrine of the Báb by Shoghi Effendi, he named the
remaining doors and a complete description is provided in, Ugo Giachery, Shoghi
Effendi’s Recollections, pp. 214-216, Appendix IX.

in Germany. About that time, a Tablet was revealed in honor of
Mírzá ‘Azízu’lláh Khán Varqá – upon him rest the Glory of God –
which I record below in this notebook:

O thou who art firm in the Covenant! Thy letter of 2

> Ramadán 1332 [A.H.]521 was received, testifying to thy humility
> and reverence before the Abhá Kingdom. Its essence spoke of thy

> serves this mighty Cause. Thy example is worthy of a station
similar to thy father’s in the Abhá Kingdom!

Thou had written about your meetings with prominent and

brilliantly.

At any rate, be constantly attentive and mindful that some
of the ‘ulamá’ and prominent citizens may awaken to the Cause.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‘Abbás

Extract 49: On 14 May 1915, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá graciously gave me this
Tablet to take to Iran, to make copies and disseminate among the
friends.523 A copy is recorded in this notebook to give a good end to
the chapter:
523The original Text also appears in Makátib ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, vol. 4, pp. 114-

\[118\] Habíb Mu’ayyad / Ahang Rabbani 471

The Divine Friends, upon them rest the greetings of their Lord, the
Compassionate, the Merciful.

> O ye the beloved of my heart and soul!

The world of being is encompassed by mankind’s
heedlessness, and all horizons are hidden by dark clouds. The
world of humanity has become afflicted by hardship and mourning
and all the tribes of the world of humanity are lost and bereft of
guidance. From the beginning of human history until now such a
world devouring fire has not been ignited and such a conflagration
has not been lit, destroying all horizons. All eyes are in tears, all
hearts are burning sore.

The continent of Europe is all a field where blood is being
shed, and it is the veritable arena of atrocity. In the words of the
poet:

”There is no blade of grass or thorn that is not red with the
blood of martyrs.”

Cries and lamentations are rising to high heaven and tears
of orphans flow like unto a torrent. All one sees is the sadness and
sorrow of fathers who are mourning their sons. All one can hear is
the lamenting of mothers, which affects one’s soul and heart. From
all sides sighs, regrets and lamentation and the cry of pain can be
heard emanating from bereaved hearts. In all corners the wolves of
hatred and rancor are hiding in ambush. This weakling, the
human species, is surrounded by these calamities. Despite this they
are all asleep with the sleep of heedlessness, they have all alienated
themselves from any fellowship or love. There is no reflection, there
is no meditation, there are no deep thoughts or delving as to the
cause of events. No one prays in an earnest communion; no one
seeks from God the remedy of these afflictions. There is no remorse,
no supplication, no repentance, no turning back to the threshold of
the Creator.

All this in spite of the fact that in my journeys and travels
> in Europe and America, in all their Churches, assemblages and
> meeting places, crying aloud I warned them, I admonished them in
these words:

“O revered people in these assemblies! Unstop your ears.

> There is a great danger ahead. A most afflictive catastrophe is
> impending. The whole continent of Europe has become a storage
> house of weapons and explosives. Inflammable material is hidden
> in every nook and cranny. It is all waiting for one spark so that a
> great flame may reach the heights of heaven. Through a single
> explosion all things will be turned upside down. O people present
> here, strive with the entirety of your endeavor that these fires be
> extinguished, so that ye may be the instruments of prevention of this
> great earthquake. Otherwise this calamity like a deafening
> lightening, will hit the children of humanity from all sides. All
> countries will be destroyed. All cities will become bereft of security
> and tranquility. All nations will witness the fire of hell. All
> countries will have exhibitions of dust and ashes. Humanity will
> become dispersed then, but what benefit would remorse and regret
achieve then?

“It is better that you learn the heavenly Teachings now, that
> you may chant the divine melodies in all parts of the world now.
> You should raise the banner of the Oneness of humanity that you
> may become occupied in the promulgation of universal peace. From
> the inception of history nearly six thousand years there has been
> warfare, belligerence, manslaughter, atrocity and bloodshed. The
> children of men have not had a moment of rest or tranquility, but
> praise be to God that this century is the century of light, this age is
> that in which truth is revealed and the mysteries are unraveled. It is
> also most evident and clear that enmity and hatred destroy the
> foundation of the world of humanity, and that love and faithfulness
> give eternal life. Conflict is the most afflictive torment and death
> itself, whereas peace is the fountain wherefrom the water of life
> flows. Hostilities uproot institutions, whereas peace causes
reconstruction where there was destruction before. Wars result in

sorrow and regret, but peace and reconciliation result in joy and
exhilaration. Killing and slaughter is sadness and bereavement, but
concord and reunion result in great festivity. As much as in your
power, strive and exert yourselves so that the flag of the oneness of
the world of humanity may wave in the midmost center of existence,
and the Son of Truth may illuminate with the light of love. Swords
and arrows may be put aside and the life-giving breeze of
agreement, fellowship and affection may give new life. This
darkness of the human tragedy may be dispelled, and heavenly light
may shine over both East and West. The thorn bush of existence
may become a rose garden, and the wasteland may become the
meadow of the merciful. The season of autumn may finally end,
and the life-giving breeze of springtime may establish itself over
mountain and mead.”

All those present would agree with me that this should be
the case, but they were asleep in the couch of heedlessness. No one
gave it a deep thought, no one tried hard, and consequently this
spark and conflagration has started to burn the foundation of
humanity. Now East and West are in the great commotion, and
this devastating tornado has uprooted all the fresh trees of existence.
Glory be to God! What manner of ignorance is this, what manner
of negligence and inattention?

“The well is on the path, and the wayfarer knows and is
conscious of it. I am amazed, though, at how veiled are the
wayfarer’s eyes.”

Human beings with their own feet, of their own volition,
have entered the midmost fire. Humanity is capable of sullying the
pure choice wine, of transforming the sweet fountain of water into a
brackish and salty pool. They wish to extinguish a lighted candle to
darken the luminous dawn, to exchange the honey of faithfulness
for the lethal poison of unfaithfulness, and at the same time they
desire glory in this achievement.

At any rate, the teachings of the Blessed Beauty – may my
life be a sacrifice unto Him – were all spread and were proclaimed
