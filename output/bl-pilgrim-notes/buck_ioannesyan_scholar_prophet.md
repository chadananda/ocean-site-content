Abstract
Rediscovery of contemporaneous handwritten notes by Cambridge orientalist,
Edward Granville Browne,1 of his historic meetings with Baha’u’llah, prophet-
founder of the Baha’i Faith in Akka (St Jean d’Acre), Palestine, during his stay there
– which lasted from his arrival on Sunday, 13 April 1890, to Browne’s departure on
Sunday, 20 April 1890 – significantly adds to our knowledge of those spiritual and
momentous events. Given the fact that Baha’u’llah was to become widely regarded
as the founder of a new world religion, Browne’s published account of his 16 April
1890 audience with Baha’u’llah takes on added significance as a rare first-hand
description by a distinguished contemporary from the West. Although well-known
to those acquainted with Baha’i history, relatively little is known regarding the
sequence of events. This article will draw from Cambridge manuscripts to add some
new details, and will draw a fuller picture of what transpired by use of Browne’s
correspondence with Russian academics, along with known Baha’i sources
judiciously compared with Azali sources. Together, a composite account of that
historic encounter between scholar and prophet, Browne and Baha’u’llah, will be
oﬀered.
__________

On Wednesday, 16 April 1890, Cambridge orientalist, Edward Granville Browne,
was granted his first audience with Baha’u’llah, the charismatic prophet-founder of
the Baha’i Faith, in Acre (Arabic: Akka/Akko), Palestine. By having established this
new world religion, Baha’u’llah may be considered to be phenomenologically
comparable to the founders of other world religions – such as Jesus Christ,
Muḥammad or even the Buddha. Many have wondered: ‘What was Jesus like?’ Or:
‘Wouldn’t it be wonderful to meet the Buddha in person?’ This would be a perfect
analogy for characterizing the nature of Professor Browne’s extraordinary
experience, which it is the purpose of this paper to revisit, with new information
that has recently come to light. This new evidence oﬀers a glimpse into what it must
have been like to have attained the presence of Baha’u’llah. Indeed, Browne has left
posterity an account of that historic encounter, where, as the title of this paper
indicates, ‘Scholar Meets Prophet’.

Scholar Meets Prophet                                                                 22

The nature of this encounter, as Browne describes it, was nothing short of profound.
It is the encounter itself that is ‘historical’ and worthy of note. Otherwise, nothing
really changed as a result of this episode. The world [p. 22] went on, without
noticing. No headline. No news story. This meeting, after all, was private. Yet it is
‘historical’ precisely because of what it tells us about Baha’u’llah as a personage. So
the very thought of entering into the presence of one of those rarest of all historical
personalities – one held to be a divinely inspired Messenger of God – is quite
extraordinary. It is this experiential gift that endures as Browne’s most enduring
legacy.

It makes sense to begin with Baha’i sources, in order to review what is already
widely known to students of Baha’i history. Baha’i sources rely heavily on Browne’s
own account in A Traveller’s Narrative (hereafter ‘TN1’ for the Persian text, and ‘TN2’
for Browne’s translation into English).2 The Persian manuscript of TN1 (written by
Baha’u’llah’s eldest son, ‘Abdu’l-Baha)3 was given to Browne on Sunday, 20 April
1890, just outside of Akka (Acre), Palestine. First, the narrative presented below is
taken from the oﬃcial Baha’i history, God Passes By, written by Shoghi Eﬀendi,
Guardian of the Baha’i Faith (1921–1957), in 1944:

> It was in that same mansion that the distinguished Orientalist, Prof. E. G. Browne
> of Cambridge, was granted his four successive interviews with Bahá’u’lláh, during
> the five days he was His guest at Bahjí (April 15–20, 1890), interviews
> immortalized by the Exile’s historic declaration that ‘these fruitless strifes, these
> ruinous wars shall pass away and the ’Most Great Peace’ shall come’. ‘The face of
> Him on Whom I gazed’, is the interviewer’s memorable testimony for posterity, ‘I
> can never forget, though I cannot describe it. Those piercing eyes seemed to read
> one’s very soul; power and authority sat on that ample brow.… No need to ask in
> whose presence I stood, as I bowed myself before one who is the object of a
> devotion and love which kings might envy and emperors sigh for in vain’. ‘Here’,
> the visitor himself has testified, ‘did I spend five most memorable days, during
> which I enjoyed unparalleled and unhoped-for opportunities of holding intercourse
> with those who are the fountain-heads of that mighty and wondrous spirit, which
> works with invisible but ever-increasing force for the transformation and
> quickening of a people who slumber in a sleep like unto death. It was, in truth, a
> strange and moving experience, but one whereof I despair of conveying any save the
> feeblest impression’.4

Here, Shoghi Eﬀendi is quoting Browne himself, from his lengthy introduction to
his translation of A Traveller’s Narrative. Browne was given an audience with
Baha’u’llah. This historic meeting took place on Wednesday, 16 April 1890.
Browne’s pen-portrait of Baha’u’llah is doubtless the most oft-quoted passage in all
of Browne’s writings.

The relatively recently discovered E. G. Browne’s correspondence with Baron V.
Rosen in the Archive of the Russian Academy of Sciences in St Petersburg has
revealed some interesting new information about Browne’s research on the Babi and
Baha’i Faiths.5 Browne kept active correspondence with Rosen until the time of the

Scholar Meets Prophet                                                                23

latter’s passing. Most of this scholarly exchange of letters was related to the
emerging new religion. It contradicted the common view that the appearance of new
religions was only possible in ancient times because it was thought to be
characteristic of the early forms of human society. This, most probably, accounts for
the keen interest of [p. 23] the European general public and, particularly, scholars
and diplomats, in the subject at the time.

These archival materials remained unpublished for more than a century until they
were brought together and published with commentaries in Youli Ioannesyan’s
book: The Development of the Babi/Baha’i Communities: Exploring Baron Rosen’s Archives.6
Browne’s correspondence with Rosen comprises 49 letters, dating 1889–1902 (two
letters are in Persian, the rest are in English). These letters cover a very wide range
of issues and show Browne’s close cooperation with Rosen in the course of his
research on the Babi and Baha’i Faiths.

Among the issues discussed in the letters is Browne’s account of his trip to Cyprus
and Palestine during which he met with Baha’u’llah and Mirza Yaḥya (Ṣubḥ-i-Azal,
younger half-brother and contemporary rival for leadership of the fledgling Babi/
Baha’i community). Browne draws a picture of the journey from a slightly diﬀerent
perspective than in his published account of that historic trip. His description of his
encounter with the founder of the Baha’i Faith which he shares with his Russian
colleague preceded the appearance of the published version (Browne’s letter is dated
6 May 1890) and, thus, preserves some details omitted in the version which he
presented to the general public. Consequently, the two accounts are complementary,
since each contains information lacking in the other. On the other hand, they
present the same story expressed in a diﬀerent language. The published version is as
follows:

> During the five days spent at Behjé (Tuesday, April 15th to Sunday, April 20th
> [1890]), I was admitted to Behā’s presence four times. These interviews
> always took place an hour or two before noon, and lasted from twenty minutes to
> half-an-hour. One of Behá’s sons always accompanied me, and once Akā Mīrzā Akā
> Jān [Jenāb-i Khādimu’llāh] the amanuensis (kātib-i āyāt) was also present. In their
> general features these interviews resembled the first, of which I have attempted to
> give a description.7

In his 6 May 1890 letter to Rosen, Browne writes of his five interviews with
Baha’u’llah:

> After leaving Cyprus (on April 5th) I proceeded to Beyrout, & thence, after a delay
> of 5 days (for I had to obtain permission from Beha; to approach him) to Acre. This
> delay unfortunately reduced my time at Acre to 5 days (for the ride thither & back
> occupied 3 days each way), but during these 5 days I was completely amongst the
> Babis, who treated me with unbounded kindness. I was granted 5 interviews with
> Beha himself, but of course I could not ask him any questions.8
Scholar Meets Prophet                                                                24

Both accounts confirm that Browne’s visit to Baha’u’llah’s residence at Baḥjī lasted
for 5 days (although Browne was in Acre for eight days, from Sunday, 13 April 1890
through Sunday, 20 April 1890). The letter sheds light on why Browne’s stay in Acre
was reduced to 5 days. The reason for shortening his trip was the delay for 5 days
caused by the need to obtain permission from Baha’u’llah for these interviews.
Otherwise, Browne would have spent 10 days at Baḥjī, for a total of 13 days in Acre.
[p. 24]

There is some incongruity between the two versions concerning the number of
interviews Browne had with Baha’u’llah. While Browne states in the letter that he
‘was granted 5 interviews with Behá himself ’, in the published account, Browne
puts the number of such interviews at four, saying that he ‘was admitted to Behá’s
presence four times’. However, both accounts confirm the ‘unbounded kindness’
with which Browne was treated by the Baha’is during his whole stay in the Holy
Land, as Browne nostalgically recounts:

> The spirit which pervades the Bábís is such that it can hardly fail to aﬀect most
> powerfully all subjected to its influence. It may appall or attract: it cannot be
> ignored or disregarded. Let those who have not seen disbelieve me if they will; but,
> should that spirit once reveal itself to them, they will experience an emotion which
> they are not likely to forget.9

It is most interesting to collate and compare the two versions of Browne’s
description of Baha’u’llah. The published version is well-known to those interested
in or studying the Baha’i Faith. It was even translated into Russian by A. G.
Tumanski and quoted in the ‘Introduction’ to his Russian translation of the Kitab-i-
Aqdas (‘the Most Holy Book’), the most important of all Baha’i scriptures.10

The pen-portrait of Baha’u’llah that the famed British orientalist draws reflects his
admiration for the distinguished prophet whom he met. Recounting his first
impression of Baha’u’llah in this historic encounter, Browne experienced ‘a throb of
wonder and awe’ on beholding this venerable and charismatic religious founder:

> Though I dimly suspected whither I was going and whom I was to behold …, a
> second or two elapsed ere, with a throb of wonder and awe, I became definitely
> conscious that the room was not untenanted. In the corner where the divan met the
> wall sat a wondrous and venerable figure, crowned with a felt head-dress of the
> kind called tāj [‘crown’] by dervishes (but of unusual height and make), round the
> base of which was wound a small white turban. The face of him on whom I gazed I
> can never forget, though I cannot describe it. Those piercing eyes seemed to read
> one’s very soul; power and authority sat on that ample brow; while the deep lines
> on the forehead and face implied an age which the jet-black hair and beard flowing
> down in indistinguishable luxuriance almost to the waist seemed to belie. No need
> to ask in whose presence I stood, as I bowed myself before one who is the object of
> a devotion and love which kings might envy and emperors sigh for in vain!11
Scholar Meets Prophet                                                                           25

As for what transpired during the course of this historic encounter, Browne recounts
these memorable, and probably immortal statements by Baha’u’llah:

> A mild dignified voice bade me be seated, and then continued: – ‘Praise be to God
> that thou hast attained! … Thou hast come to see a prisoner and an exile. … We
> desire but the good of the world and the happiness of the nations; yet they deem us
> a stirrer up of strife and sedition worthy of bondage and banishment. … That all
> nations should become one in faith [p. 25] and all men as brothers; that the bonds
> of aﬀection and unity between the sons of men should be strengthened; that
> diversity of religion should cease, and diﬀerences of race be annulled – what harm
> is there in this? … Yet so it shall be; these fruitless strifes, these ruinous wars shall
> pass away, and the ‘Most Great Peace’ shall come. … Do not you in Europe need
> this also? Is not this that which Christ foretold? … Yet do we see your kings and
> rulers lavishing their treasures more freely on means for the destruction of the
> human race than on that which would conduce to the happiness of mankind. …
> These strifes and this bloodshed and discord must cease, and all men be as one
> kindred and one family. … Let not a man glory in this, that he loves his country; let
> him rather glory in this, that he loves his kind … ’. Such, so far as I can recall them,
> were the words which, besides many others, I heard from Beha. Let those who read
> them consider well with themselves whether such doctrines merit death and bonds,
> and whether the world is more likely to gain or lose by their diﬀusion.12

The term ‘audience’ best describes the nature of this meeting, insofar as Browne
himself states that he could not ask any questions of Baha’u’llah. Certainly Browne
did ask a lot of questions while he was at Acre/Akka, but these were interactions
that he had with others in the Baha’i enclave. This may explain why Browne’s
description of this event is so deeply impressionistic. While the substance of what
transpired is eﬀectively conveyed, the nature of the interaction was somewhat
analogous to being admitted into the royal court of a king. Although there were no
trappings of royalty, or any pretensions to any earthly grandeur, it is clear that
Browne was struck – one might say, ‘awestruck’ – by Baha’u’llah’s force of
personality, especially by the ‘power and authority’ that emanated from Baha’u’llah
with such intensity as to practically overwhelm Browne himself. Since Browne was
reasonably familiar with Baha’u’llah’s teachings, one can say that the nature of his
audiences with Baha’u’llah was not so much informational as it was impressionistic.

Browne has left an independent summary of this event. The account in Browne’s
letter to Rosen, though no less interesting and impressive, gives a diﬀerent
perspective to the reader. Here Browne is more focused on the surprise and
amazement he experienced meeting Baha’u’llah:

> I sat humbly before him while he talked. His discourse was oracular but rather
> general in character. He spoke as ‘one having authority’, but not exactly as I had
> expected – like a Master, and a Prophet – but not as an Incarnation of the Divinity.
> He is to look at a very majestic old man – but though he must be 70 at least his
> long beard & hair are quite blacḳ. He wears a very tall namad (‫) ن " " " " " "م""د‬13 cap with a
> small white turban. His manner is gracious and dignified, but somewhat restless,

> suggesting great stores of energy. He talked for the most part of the necessity of all
> nations choosing one language as a means of international communication & one
> writing (a sort of sermon on the concluding text of the ‫ ل"وح اق"دس‬14 & of the necessity
> of putting down war & international jealousy & hostility. Of doctrine properly so
> called he spoke little.15

Both accounts stress the ‘authority’ with which Baha’u’llah spoke, as well as the
message of peace which was the central theme of Baha’u’llah’s words. Browne’s
letter to Baron Rosen also reveals that the prominent western [p. 26] scholar,
despite his deep knowledge and understanding of the Babi (to a lesser extent Baha’i)
teachings, had some misconceptions about the status of the prophetic credentials of
Baha’u’llah (who, in Baha’i terms, was considered to be a ‘Manifestation of God’) in
general and of Baha’u’llah’s theophanic and messianic claims in particular. In his
letter, Browne states that Baha’u’llah, contrary to his expectations, was ‘like a
Master, and a Prophet – but not as an Incarnation of the Divinity’ (!). In other
words, Browne believed that Baha’u’llah had laid claim to being ‘an Incarnation of
the Divinity’.

Whether this misconception came from rival Azali sources – and those Azalis with
whom Browne kept up active correspondence – or was merely due to the ‘Christian
language’ that Browne employed in this description (given the fact that Christians
represent Jesus Christ in the very same terms) is very much open to speculation.
However, even Baron Rosen himself wrote of Baha’u’llah in a similar vein, saying
that ‘even though his identification of himself with the Divinity may appear to us
blasphemous, we should not forget that, at least, he [Baha’u’llah] has imagined
himself not as a scourging divinity … but rather a mild, forgiving, loving and peace-
making one’.16 In the light of this letter, we may assume that Rosen might have been
influenced in his personal understanding of Baha’u’llah’s claim by what Browne had
previously written.

As more or less indicated in the previous discussion, Browne had three or four more
audiences with Baha’u’llah that same week. Accounts vary slightly. During the
course of his visits with Baha’u’llah – from Tuesday, 15 April to Sunday, 20 April
1890 – Browne says that he had five audiences with Baha’u’llah, yet elsewhere states
that he had four meetings, while Mirza Badi‘u’llah, one of Baha’u’llah’s sons, reports
three audiences, by way of this independent account:

> We went to Haifa and rented a house. The house was called Oliphant. It was for the
> purpose of a summer residence. The house was located in German [Templar]
> colony. After residing in that house for little while, there the news came that Mr.
> Browne of England, a professor and orientalist at Cambridge, had returned from
> Iran and that he was coming by way of land to Baḥjī (‘Akka). He asked to attain the
> holy presence of Baha’u’llah. Because it was not proper to accept Mr. Browne into
> His [Baha’u’llah’s] presence at that house in Haifa, then Baha’u’llah moved back to
> Baḥjī. In the year 1890, … Mr Browne arrived in ‘Akka. Ghusn-i Akbar (the ‘Great
> Branch’, Mirza Muḥammad ‘Ali) had gone to India for publication of some holy
> texts. Ghusn-i A‘ẓam (the ‘Most Great Branch’, ‘Abdu’l-Baha) was residing in ‘Akka.

> This writer [Mirza Badi‘u’llah] and Ghusn-i Āthār (Mirza Ḍiyā’u’llāh = the Purest
> Branch) was hosting this dear guest [Browne]. . . He was a very learned man. He
> spoke eloquently well in the sweet Persian language . . .

> The first time that he had the honour of attaining Baha’u’llah’s holy Presence,
> although he [Browne] had a few questions, [in fact] he only asked one question
> about discord and disunity of all religions. Then he observed silence and the
> condition and manner of his behaviour changed.

> After he had been dismissed from His [Baha’u’llah’s] presence, he [Browne]
> entered the room that we had provided for him. He was dazed [senseless] [p. 27]
> and was just moving [silently] his lips... After that, he became motionless and
> quiescent. I asked him, ‘What happened to you? You became completely silent!’ He
> replied: ‘After He [Baha’u’llah] looked at me, I saw a power and authority that
> changed my normal condition. I noticed such penetrating and influential power and
> authority in His eyes that I had never seen in any of the kings or rulers that I had
> ever met’. I asked [him] about the reason why he was moving his lips. He said: ‘I
> repeated [to myself ] the reply which He gave concerning the cause of the discord
> between religions in order not to forget it’.

> The time of staying (residing) at the mansion of Baḥjī was one weeḳOn one
> occasion, Mr. Browne and the Blessed Beauty went to Junaiynih. He took the book,
> A Traveller’s Narrative, with him, which he translated into English, and published
> both English and Persian versions of that book and sent a copy of that book [to the
> Baha’is in ‘Akka] in both languages.17

What caused Browne to become “dazed”? Baha’u’llah was known to have typically
averted his gaze away from whoever had attained his audience, primarily because it
would overwhelm the person upon whom Baha’u’llah directed his gaze. So the
question arises as to why Baha’u’llah decided to look directly at Professor Browne.
Perhaps it was when Baha’u’llah asked Browne a question, as noted in Browne’s
notes: ‘Then he [Baha’u’llah] said – “You have come to see a prisoner – He went on
to speak of his suﬀerings & the letters he had written to the Kings asking me if I
had read them – He then read part of a [lawḥ, i.e. Tablet] beginning:’ (Browne Sup.
21(8), Acre, folio 5.) Alternatively, Baha’u’llah may have looked directly at Browne
when the latter asked his question about interreligious discord. Of this historic
encounter, Browne noted, in part: ‘Wednesday, April 15th – In morning admitted to
audience with Behá – It was wonderful – only one of his sons besides myself was
present’ Baha’u’llah ‘began to talk – marvellous fire & vigour’. (Browne Sup.21(8),
Acre, folio 4.)

To further complicate matters, Browne, in his Cambridge notes, gives incongruous
information regarding the sequence of dates and days:

> ‘April Sat. 12.’18
> ‘April S. 13.’19            ‘Sunday, April 13.’20
> ‘April M. 14.’21
> ‘April T. 15.’22            ‘Tuesday, April 14.’23
> ‘April W. 16.’24            ‘Wednesday, April 15’25
> ‘April Th. 17.’26           ‘Thursday, April 1627
> ‘April Fri. 18.’28          ‘Friday, April 17, 1890’29
> ‘April – Sat. 19’30

‘April – Sun. 20.’31

So which dates are correct? In A Traveller’s Narrative, Browne refers to ‘Tuesday, April
14th’,32 only to contradict himself later on: ‘Tuesday, April 15th to Sunday, April
20th’.33 The available evidence weighs in favour of the [p. 28] following sequence of
dates:

> Sunday, 13 April 1890; Monday, April 14, 1890; Tuesday, April 15, 1890;
> Wednesday, April 16, 1890; Thursday, April 17, 1890; Friday, April 18, 1890;
> Saturday, April 19, 1890; Sunday, April 20, 1890.

Briefly, this was Browne’s day-by-day itinerary (assuming that it was dated
according the UK calendar), based squarely on (Browne Sup.21(8), Acre, folios 13–
14), to wit: Sunday, 13 April 1890: ‘Arrd at Acre …’; Monday, April 14, 1890: ‘Moved
to house of Mírzá Assadu’lláh the Bábí …’; Tuesday, April 15, 1890: ‘Moved to
house near BEHA’s …’; Wednesday, April 16, 1890: ‘musharraf [‘honored’ in Persian,
i.e. had audience with Baha’u'llah] (see a few pages back)’; Thursday, April 17, 1890:
‘musharraf …’; Friday, April 18, 1890: ‘musharraf …’; Saturday, April 19, 1890:
[blank]; Sunday, April 20, 1890: ‘Farewell visit to Behá …’ (However, Browne’s
dates vary in TN2.)

Hasan M. Balyuzi explains why Browne was not granted an audience with
Baha’u’llah upon the former’s arrival in Acre, as the latter was in Haifa that time:

> Also in the possession of the present writer is the letter which Ḥājī Siyyid ‘Alī
> Afnān wrote on this occasion. His account diﬀers from Browne’s on a point or two.
> Browne mentions that he travelled from Beirut to ‘Akkā overland, in the company
> of Eyres, the British Vice-consul, whereas Ḥājī Siyyid ‘Alī states that he came by
> sea. Oversight by Afnān in writing ‘Baḥr’ (sea) instead of ‘Barr’ (land) could easily
> account for this. However, these are minor details. Afnān records that when
> Browne reached ‘Akkā, Bahā’u’llāh was in Haifa, and that He returned to Bahjī the
> following day. This explains why Browne was given hospitality for one night in
> ‘Akkā, in the home of a Bahā’ī, before being conducted to the Mansion of Bahjī.34

Browne describes three meetings that took place during the mornings of the
following days: (1) Wednesday, 16 April 1890;35 (2) Thursday, April 17, 1890 (‘Met
as usual’);36 (3) Friday, April 18, 1890;37 (4) Sunday, April 20, 1890 (‘Farewell visit
of Baha’).38 Although not an audience as such, Browne saw Baha’u’llah, on one
other occasion, walking in the garden, surrounded by followers, on Thursday
afternoon, 17 April 1890.39 Thus it appears that Browne had four audiences with
Baha’u’llah, with a fifth encounter, being Browne’s sighting of Baha’u’llah in a
garden.

As previously stated, Browne’s first audience with Baha’u’llah (on Wednesday, 16
April 1890) lasted around twenty minutes,40 during which time Baha’u’llah recited a
Tablet that Browne copied, in his own hand,41 and later translated in TN2 itself.42
These likely constitute some of ‘the words which, besides many others, I heard from
Beha’, to which Browne refers, and therefore supplement any reconstruction of this
significant meeting. In eﬀect, these words are an accurate and added record of what
the prophet imparted to the scholar in this rare and historic meeting. This was not a
meeting of equals, however, as the charismatic power and intensity of Baha’u’llah
simply overwhelmed Browne. At the end of this session, ‘Soon we were dismissed’.

The translation by Shoghi Eﬀendi (‘Abdu’l-Baha’s appointed successor and leader of
the Baha’i community from 1921 to 1957) is provided below. Shoghi Eﬀendi’s
translation, which is current among Baha’is today (and [p.29] which may easily be
compared with Browne’s own rendering in TN2),44 reads as follows:

> The Purpose of the one true God, exalted be His glory, in revealing Himself unto
> men is to lay bare those gems that lie hidden within the mine of their true and
> inmost selves. That the divers communions of the earth, and the manifold systems
> of religious belief, should never be allowed to foster the feelings of animosity
> among men, is, in this Day, of the essence of the Faith of God and His Religion.
> These principles and laws, these firmly-established and mighty systems, have
> proceeded from one Source, and are the rays of one Light. That they diﬀer one from
> another is to be attributed to the varying requirements of the ages in which they
> were promulgated. …

> The utterance of God is a lamp, whose light is these words: Ye are the fruits of one
> tree, and the leaves of one branch. Deal ye one with another with the utmost love
> and harmony, with friendliness and fellowship. He Who is the Day Star of Truth
> beareth Me witness! So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the

Here, Baha’u’llah ‘re-revealed’ a ‘Tablet’ (i.e. epistle, considered a sacred text)
previously ‘revealed’ (i.e. extemporaneously dictated, while inspired by divine
‘revelation,’ according to Baha’i belief) quoted in Baha’u’llah’s last revealed book,
The Epistle to the Son of the Wolf (c. 1891). The original Tablet, in the hand of the
celebrated Baha’i calligrapher Mishkīn-Qalam, is published in its entirety.46, 47

Later, that same day (Wednesday, 16 April 1890), Browne was in the company of
Baha’u’llah’s eldest son, ‘Abdu’l-Baha, wherein Browne records the following notes
(transcribed to the present writer’s ability to read Browne’s clear, yet idiosyncratic
cursive):

> Soon we were dismissed – […] Visit from [?] ‘Abbás Efendi, who spoke much of
> humanity & civilization. […] (Browne Sup.21(8), Acre, folio 8.)

Then, a most interesting comment regarding Baha’u’llah’s personal secretary:

> Aḳá Mírzá Aḳá Ján also came & talked with great eloquence for a while, saying
> amongst other things – that Behá had said – (speaking of me) ‘Agar nusratí ‘azím az
> dast-i-ín peydá bi-shavad ba‘íd az lutf rabb nist – (Browne Sup.21(8), Acre, folio 8.

Transliteration is Browne’s.)

A more complete transliteration may be ventured as follows:

Agar nuṣrat-i ‘aẓīm az dast-i-īn paydā bi-shavad ba‘īd az luṭf-i-Rabb nīst –

The following provisional translation has been proposed by Nahzy Abadi Buck:

> ‘Should there be any support [service] [to the Cause] by this [fellow, i.e. Browne],
> that will not be far-fetched from God’s bounty’.48

If this is an accurate reconstruction of this statement attributed to Baha’u’llah by
Mirza Aqa Jan and as reported and recorded by Browne himself, the [p. 30] purport
seems to be that Baha’u’llah was stating that it is quite possible that Browne,
through his future publications, had every potential of rendering a great service in
providing accurate information and insights regarding the nature of the Baha’i Faith
which, as Browne later came to recognize, was a nascent world religion, in the
making. In substantive support of this interpretation, it may be pointed out that,
sometime later, Baha’u’llah, in an epistle to Āqā Mīrzā ‘Alī-Muḥammad Khān,
Muwaqqar al-Dawla (d. 1921), recognized Browne’s genuine interest in
investigating this new world religion, which was just dawning on the world’s
historical horizon:

> The youth [Browne] mentioned therein attained Our presence. Although this
> Wronged One had not consorted for many years past with people from foreign
> lands, We received him on several occasions. Portents of sincerity could be
> discerned on his visage.49

Besides the first meeting of Wednesday, 16 April 1890, one other meeting of note
stands out: (1) Friday, 18 April 1890. Since no account of these subsequent
meetings is to be found in A Traveller’s Narrative (apart from the mention of the fact
that Browne had four audiences with Baha’u’llah), one further episode warrants
description in some detail, as the evidence permits. So the following information is
now made public for the very first time:

> Friday – April 17 [18], 1890: Admitted to audience with Behá in morning for some
> 20 min. or 1/2 an hour. He said amongst other things (as nearly as I can remember)
–

> ‫بعد از دو سال همۀ ایران بابی میشود‬
> ‫ شاه یا باید بابی بشود یا باید ول کند‬50

> Ba‘d az du sāl hami-yi Īrān Bābī mīshavad.

Shāh yā bāyad Bābī bishavad yā bāyad val kunad.

> ‘After two years, all of Iran will become ‘Babi’. The Shah should either become a
> Babi or quit.’

These particular (and somewhat peculiar) words, as taken down by Browne (Browne
Sup.21(8), Acre, folio 10), are open to serious question and may not withstand
scrutiny once critically read and evaluated. For it is highly doubtful that these words
were either spoken by Baha’u’llah directly or written down correctly by Browne.
Baha’u’llah, moreover, disclaimed any ‘political’ pretensions, and would not have
spoken of the Shah in such a crass fashion. One only needs read Baha’u’llah’s
lengthy Lawḥ-i Sulṭān, ‘Tablet to the Sultan’ (King of Persia), to appreciate the
diﬀerence.

Leaving aside its content, the main reason for questioning the authenticity of this
passage, or at least its wording, is the nature of the language that Browne attributes
to Baha’u’llah. On sociological grounds, it is highly doubtful, if not altogether
surprising, that in 1890 – only two years before Baha’u’llah’s ascension, after the
Kitab-i-Aqdas (c. 1873) had been revealed and the Baha’i community had fully taken
shape, with a clear Baha’i self-identity – that the charismatic prophet-founder of the
Baha’i Faith would still refer to this religion as ‘Babi’ and to its followers as ‘Babis’.
51 [p. 31]

By that time (in 1890), Baha’is had long been referred to in Baha’u’llah’s writings as
‘the people of Bahā’ (ahl-i Bahā). That Baha’is already applied this term to
themselves is also attested by Baha’u’llah’s epistles to followers in Ashkabad and by
the poem in honour of the Russian emperor composed by an unknown Baha’i poet
from Ashkabad (recently discovered by Youli Ioannesyan in the Institute of Oriental
Manuscripts, Russian Academy of Sciences, and published, with a Russian
translation).52 However, at that time, it is true that Westerners and Russian writers
still referred to Baha’is as ‘Babis’, although the term, being an anachronism, was
already obsolete.

Browne continued his notes of that meeting:

> He again insisted very strongly on the necessity of unity & concord amongst the
> nations, & spoke of the ‫ ص"ح " " " " " ""ل اك " " " " " "ب""ر‬which will come soon (1886–1887) [sic] ???

(Browne Sup.21(8), Acre, folio 10.)53

Note: Considering that the year was 1890, Browne’s reference to ‘1886–1887’ is
puzzling. Here, Baha’u’llah speaks of ‘The Most Great Peace’ (ṣulḥ-i akbar), which
represents the international peace plan that Baha’u’llah oﬀered to the political and
religious leaders of the world by way of a series of open epistles, as part of the
general proclamation of purpose and nature of Baha’u’llah’s prophetic purpose and
mission.54 Browne’s further account is as follows:

> There must be one language & one writing – The former may be either one of those
> now existing, or one invented for the purpose by a conference of savants of all
> countries. All nations must bind themselves to combine & put down any nation
> which attempts to disturb the general peace – 55

> Behá also spoke of the ‫[ ب""یت ال""عدل‬Bayt al-‘Adl, ‘The House of Justice’] which, he said,
> is to settle all disputes. The members of this will be ‘inspired’ ‫[ ُم" " " " " " "ل "ه ""م‬Arab./Pers.
> mulham – ‘inspired’]. Jihád is entirely forbidden in this ‫[ ظ " " " " " "ه " " ""ور‬Ẓuhūr =
> ‘Manifestation’ (of God)].56

> Of the ‫[ ال " " " " ""واح س " " " " ""الط " " " " ""ني‬Alvāḥ-i Salāṭīn ‘Tablets to the Rulers’] the only ones actually
> sent to the Kings were – : –

> 1. The ‫[ ل " " " " " ""وح س " " " " " "ل"ط"ان‬Lawḥ-i Sulṭān, ‘Tablet to [the] Sultan’] was addressed to the
> Sháh and conveyed by ‫[ بدیع‬Badī’].

> 2. The ‫[ ل" " " ""وح م" " " ""لک پ" " " ""اري" " " ""س‬Lawḥ-i Malīk-i Pārīs – lit., ‘Tablet to the King of Paris’] to
> Napoleon –

3. The ‫[ لوح رئس‬Lawḥ-i Ra’īs, ‘Tablet of Ra’īs’] to Sultan Abdu’l-Azīz.57

Note: This reference by Baha’u’llah to the ‘House of Justice’ is quite significant. It
shows that this institution was one of the foremost topics and teachings that
Baha’u’llah privileged as among the salient features essential to the religion that
Baha’u’llah imparted to Browne during the course of that historic interview on
Friday, 18 April 1890. That the members of the ‘House of Justice’ would be
‘inspired’ indicates the divine nature of that institution, as conceived. In keeping
with Baha’u’llah’s mandate, one of the principal purposes of the Universal House of
Justice, according to its ‘Constitution’, is ‘to provide for [p. 32] the arbitration and
settlement of disputes arising between peoples; and to be the exponent and
guardian of that Divine Justice which can alone ensure the security of, and establish
the reign of law and order in, the world’ – a function (as told by Baha’u’llah to
Browne) that has not yet been formally exercised, yet is preordained and destined as
part of its mission, purpose and service (as an arbiter of international disputes) in
the future.58

Browne introduces the topic of Baha’u’llah’s proclamatory epistles addressed to
kings and ecclesiastics, referring to these public letters by using the general title,
Alvāḥ-i Salāṭīn (‘Tablets to the Rulers’) as the collective name of this historic

correspondence. Browne then lists three specific Tablets. He first speaks of the
Lawḥ-i Sulṭān (‘Tablet to the Sultan’) as being ‘in his possession’, and, in a letter
dated 22 August 1889 to Baron Rosen, expresses his doubts as to whether a related
text, known as the Sūrat al-Mulūk (‘Sura of the Kings’) was actually authored by
Baha’u’llah:

> [P. 10/b] ... I confess that the point which puzzles me most at present with regard
> to the Babi literature is the relation of the ‫ س" " " " ""ورة امل" " " " ""لوک‬described by you to the ‫ال" " " " ""واح‬
> ‫[ س " " ""الط " " ""ني‬Alvāḥ-i Salāṭīn – ‘Tablets to the Rulers’] in my possession. The diﬀerences
> of style are so great that it would seem as if they could hardly be by the same
> author ...

> [P. 12/а] On the whole I cannot help thinking that the letter described by you must
> be by one of the other Babi chiefs, but it is curious that the ‫[[ م " " ""يرزا حس " " ""ني ع " " ""لی‬Mīrzā
> Ḥusayn-‘Alī] since Beha’s name is certainly ‫ حس ""ني ب ""ن ع ""لی‬author calls himself ‫حس ""ني ب ""ن‬
> ‫[ ع" ""لی‬Husayn bin ‘Alī] since Beha’s name is certainly ‫[ م" ""يرزا حس" ""ني ع" ""لی م" ""ازن" ""دران" ""ی‬Mīrzā
> Ḥusayn-‘Alī Māzandarānī].59

It should be noted that Browne conveyed these serious reservations about
Baha’u’llah’s authorship of the Sūrat al-Mulūk in 1889, well before his trip to
Palestine. His doubts were later dispelled by Rosen’s counterargument and further
dispelled, most probably, during his trip to the Holy Land.60

Browne elsewhere writes of ‘the text of the instructions [i.e. by Baha’u’llah] to the
bearer of the ‫“[ ل " " " " " ""وح‬Tablet,” i.e. Badī‘, the youth who bravely approached the Shah,
delivered Baha’u’llah’s epistle, and was then subjected to brutal torture and killed]
of which I had only heard the general purport at Acre’.61 This is further evidence
that Browne had asked questions about Baha’u’llah’s epistles to kings and
ecclesiastics, while at Acre. In fact, Browne had prepared to do so by bringing with
him his original manuscript of Baha’u’llah’s Tablet to Napoleon III:

> By the way I have copies of the 62 ‫ ال " " ""واح س " " ""الط " " ""ني‬which I made from Kirman MS. with
> some idea of printing these before I knew that you intended to publish the whole of
> 63. ‫ س" ""ورۀ ه" ""يکل‬If they would be of any use to you for purposes of collation I should be

> very pleased to lend them to you. I meant to say this before, but forgot & I fear that
> it is now rather late in the day – as you [P. 13/a]58 have already got to the 64 ‫ل ""وح پ ""ا پ ""ا‬
> and the 65.‫ ل " " ""وح م " " ""لک پ " " ""اري " " ""س‬And / besides I expect that your MS. is a very good one &
> would gain but little by collation with the not very accurate text I have. The original
> of this latter I took with me to Acre to clarify certain points about it, & the Bábís
> would hardly let me have it back again, saying it was a corrupt text & had better be
> destroyed! However I told them that it was the only one I had of these writings, & I
> should like to keep it till I got a better one, so they rather unwillingly gave it back
> to me ... 66 [p. 33]

Saturday, 19 April 1890: This day is a complete cipher. Browne records nothing for
that day.

Sunday, 20 April 1890: Browne’s record of his final audience with Baha’u’llah is
laconic in the extreme: ‘Farewell visit to Behá’.67 Balyuzi provides a useful summary
of what last transpired right before Browne’s departure back to Cambridge
University:

> Siyyid ‘Alī Afnān corroborates in his letter Browne’s statement that books
> were presented to him. Browne names two books: a manuscript copy of the Kitāb-i-
> Īqān (The Book of Certitude) in the handwriting of Zaynu’l-Muqarrabīn, and a copy
> of A Traveller’s Narrative, also in manuscript form, in the handwriting of the same
> eminent scribe. Afnān mentions a copy of the Tablet to Nāṣiri’d-Dīn Shāh as being
> among the gifts. He corroborates, too, the statement of Browne that they travelled
> back together overland to Beirut, which they reached on April 22nd.68

In a letter dated 4 August 1890, ‘Abdu’l-Baha, in the first of a series of letters in
years to follow, expressed to Browne high hopes that Browne would publish what
would come to be regarded as ‘the undisputed authority’ and even as the definitive
‘sacred history’ of the origins of the Baha’i Faith:

> You had referred to history; you should so endeavour that in future centuries your
> history may become the undisputed authority, nay be considered sacred history,
> and accepted both by the communities of the people of the Kingdom and by the
> just amongst the people of the world, because the greatness of this Cause is not as
> evident as it should be, due to repressive measures repeatedly taken by the
> Government of Persia, and the severity of assaults, but ere long will its Truth, like
> unto the luminous sun, be seen and discerned.69

In this ‘mission’, Browne only partly succeeded. His work was tendentious to a
fault, something for which he later tried to apologize to ‘Abdu’l-Baha when the latter
was in Europe.70

Conclusion: This study contributes to a fuller understanding of the events that
transpired during the week of 13–20 August 1890, in Acre, Palestine, especially of
Edward Granville Browne’s historic audiences with Baha’u’llah at the latter’s
mansion at Bahji. Four sources were judiciously drawn upon to further reconstruct
the events that transpired during that academically and spiritually momentous
encounter: (1) Baha’i historical sources; (2) an Azali historical account (Memoirs of
Badi’u’llah); (3) recently published archival correspondence edited, with critical
annotations by Youli Ioannesyan (The Development of the Babi/Baha’i Communities:
Exploring Baron Rosen’s Archives); and (4) previously unpublished archival
manuscripts from Cambridge University Library, obtained by Christopher Buck.

The information that was previously unavailable was primarily details of Browne’s
audience with Baha’u’llah on Friday, 18 April 1890, which Browne described in
some detail. Beyond corroborating most of what was already known about this
episode in Baha’i history, and in addition to providing heretofore unknown and/or
little-known details that combine to present a fuller picture in greater appreciation

of these memorable events, this study serves to accentuate and amplify the
emotional impact that this [p. 34] experience had on the Cambridge orientalist, and
further heightens the disappointing aftermath wherein this otherwise judicious
scholar betrayed a certain bias in favour of Baha’u’llah’s rival (but not rightful)
claimant, which is fully discussed in Balyuzi’s book and, more recently, in Buck and
Ioannesyan’s 2013 Baha’i Studies Review article.71 Buck’s 2014 British Writers article72
on Browne may serve to rehabilitate Browne somewhat, by pointing to positive
contributions on Browne’s part, in what perhaps may be considered a partial
(although by no means complete) fulfilment of Baha’u’llah’s reported statement:
‘Should there be any support [service] [to the Cause] by this [fellow, i.e. Browne],
that will not be far-fetched from God’s bounty’.73

Professor Browne’s narrative of his audience with Baha’u’llah has taken on a life of
its own, far and away above and beyond Browne himself. This episode, as described
in A Traveller’s Narrative, and as corroborated in the supplemental sources
discussed in this paper, has achieved a kind of immortality that transcends all
considerations of the author himself. What Browne has done is to re-create an
experience into which we, as individuals, can enter and vicariously relive. The
narrative is a ‘time capsule’ in the truest sense, since no one can doubt the
authenticity of the experience that Browne has indelibly impressed in the annals of
history, when ‘scholar meets prophet’, as happened when Cambridge orientalist,
Edward Granville Browne, met Baha’u’llah in Acre, 1890.
