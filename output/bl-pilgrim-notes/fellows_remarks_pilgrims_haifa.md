## Remarks to Pilgrims to Haifa by Shoghi Effendi

### by [Vivian Fellows](https://bahai-library.com/author/Vivian+Fellows)


....About the Russians, he said they are very spiritual (people) very simple, but they will understand the Faith as quickly as the Africans...

Ruhiyyih Khanum asked whether the Hands would be eligible for the House of Justice. The Guardian said: it was too early to say yet.

The Ark on the Arc - one is the law of God and the other the institutions through which the law flows.

He said the Bahá'ís should be different and we should attract people to us because we are different. We should be proud of our laws and never afraid to give our laws. That as long as we uphold the principles of our Faith and have pure hearts and motives, we may be unpopular as far as the world is concerned, but people will be attracted to us because we are different.

(Vivian Fellows)

  
The new believers must be deepened in the Covenant. This is really the only source of the fire of the love of God. To deepen in the Cause means to read the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh and the Master so thoroughly as to be able to give it to others in its pure form.

Abdu'l-Bahá: Bahá'u'lláh is the perfection and maturity of the essence of Humanity, manifesting this in Fatherhood, with command and authority, and we find in the Suratu'l-Haykal that Bahá'u'lláh said:

"Verily, We have sieved the lives and are beginning a new creation."
