                        Word  Portraits  of  ‘Abdu’l-­Bahá

We  have  sent  Him  (‘Abdu’l-­Bahá  )  down  in  the  form  of  a  human  temple.    Blest  and
sanctified  be  God  Who  createth  whatsoever  He  willeth  through  His  inviolable,  His
infallible  decree.    They  who  deprive  themselves  of  the  shadow  of  the  Branch,  are  lost  in
the  wilderness  of  error,  are  consumed  by  the  heat  of  worldly  desires,  and  are  of  those
who  will  assuredly  perish.

(Bahá’u’lláh quoted by Shoghi Effendi, The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh’, p. 135)

You  have  written  that  there  is  a  difference  among  the  believers  concerning  the  “Second
Coming  of  Christ.”    Gracious  God!    Time  and  again  this  question  hath  arisen,  and  its
answer  hath  emanated  in  a  clear  and  irrefutable  statement  from  the  pen  of  ‘Abdu’l-­Bahá,
that  what  is  meant  in  the  prophecies  by  the  ‘Lord  of  Hosts’  and  the  ‘Promised  Christ’  is  the
Blessed  Perfection  (Bahá’u’lláh  )  and  His  holiness  the  Exalted  One  (the  Báb).    My  name  is
‘Abdu’l-­Bahá.    My  qualification  is  ‘Abdu’l-­Bahá.    My  reality  is  ‘Abdu’l-­Bahá.    My  praise  is
‘Abdu’l-­Bahá.    Thralldom  to  the  Blessed  Perfection  is  my  glorious  and  refulgent  diadem,
and  servitude  to  all  the  human  race  my  perpetual  religion  .  .  .    No  name,  no  title,  no
mention,  no  commendation  have  I,  nor  will  ever  have,  except  ‘Abdu’l-­Bahá.    This  is  my
longing.    This  is  my  greatest  yearning.    This  is  my  eternal  life.    This  is  my  everlasting
glory.

(‘Abdu’l-Bahá quoted by Shoghi Effendi, The  World  Order  of  Bahá’u’lláh , p. 139)

Horace  Holley
. . . As the party rose I saw among them a stately old man, robed in a cream-coloured gown,
his white hair and beard shining in the sun. He displayed a beauty of stature, an inevitable
harmony of attitude and dress I had never seen nor thought of in men. Without having
ever visualized the Master, I knew that this was He. My whole body underwent a shock.
My heart leaped, my knees weakened, a thrill of acute receptive feeling flowed from head
to foot. I seemed to have turned into some most sensitive sense-organ, as if eyes and ears
were not enough for this sublime impression. In every part of me I stood aware of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence. From sheer happiness I wanted to cry - it seemed the most
suitable form of self-expression at my command. While my own personality was flowing
away, even while I exhibited a state of complete humility, a new being, not my own,
assumed its place. A glory, as it were from the summits of human nature, poured into me,
and I was conscious of a most intense impulse to admire. In ‘Abdu’l-Bahá I felt the awful
presence of Bahá’u’lláh, and as my thoughts returned to activity, I realized that I had drawn
as near as man now may to pure spirit and pure being. This wonderful experience came to
me beyond my own volition. I had entered the Master’s presence and become the servant
of a higher will for its own purpose. Even my memory of that temporary change of being
bears strange authority over me. I know men can become; and that single overcharged
moment, shining out from the dark mountain pass of all past time, reflects like a mirror I
can turn upon all circumstances to consider their worth by an intelligence purer than my
own.

(Horace Holley, quoted in The  Bahá’í  World  Volume 13 p. 851)
Louis  Gregory

'Abdu'l-Bahá appeared about the medium height, with a strong frame and symmetrical
features. His face is deeply furrowed and His color about that of parchment. His carriage is
erect and His entire form strikingly majestic and beautiful. His hands and nails are shapely
and pure. His silver hair is long enough to touch the shoulders. The beard is snow white,
the eyes light blue and penetrating, the nose slightly aquiline. The voice is powerful, but
capable of infinite pathos, tenderness and sympathy. His dress was that of the Oriental
gentleman of the highest classes, simple and neat and very graceful. The color of His
apparel was light, the outer robe being made of alpaca. On His head rested a light fez,
surrounded by a white turban. The meekness of the servant, the majesty of the king, are in
His brow and form.

(Louis Gregory, Louis G. Gregory Pilgrim Notes)

Howard  Colby  Ives

And when, under His encouraging sympathy, the interviewer became emptied of his
words, there followed a brief interval of silence. There was no instant and complete
outpouring of explanation and advice. He sometimes closed His eyes a moment as if He
sought guidance from above himself; sometimes sat and searched the questioner's soul
with a loving, comprehending smile that melted the heart…

And He never argued, of course. Nor did He press a point. He left one free. There was
never an assumption of authority, rather He was ever the personification of humility. He
taught "as if offering a gift to a king." He never told me what I should do, beyond
suggesting that what I was doing was right. Nor did He ever tell me what I should believe.
He made Truth and Love so beautiful and royal that the heart perforce did reverence. He
showed me by His voice, manner, bearing, smile, how I should be, knowing that out of the
pure soil of being the good fruit of deeds and words would surely spring.

There was a strange, awe-inspiring mingling of humility and majesty, relaxation and
power in His slightest word or gesture which made me long to understand its source. What
made Him so different, so immeasurably superior to any other man I had ever met? …

I have mentioned several times the impression He always made upon me of an
all-embracing love. How rarely we receive such an impression from those around us, even
from our nearest and dearest, we all know. All our human love seems based upon self, and
even its highest expression is limited to one or to a very few. Not so was the love which
radiated from 'Abdu'l-Bahá. Like the sun it poured upon all alike and, like it, also warmed
and gave new life to all it touched….

No matter what subject was brought up He was perfectly at home in its discussion, yet
always with an undercurrent of modesty and loving consideration for the opinions of
others. I have before spoken of His unfailing courtesy. It was really more than what that
term usually connotes to the Western mind. The same Persian word is used for both
reverence and courtesy. He "saw the Face of His Heavenly Father in every face" and
reverenced the soul behind it. How could one be discourteous if such an attitude was held
towards everyone!...

In all of my many opportunities of meeting, of listening to and talking with
'Abdu'l-Bahá I was impressed, and constantly more deeply impressed, with His method of
teaching souls. That is the word. He did not attempt to reach the mind alone. He sought
the soul, the reality of every one He met. Oh, He could be logical, even scientific in His
presentation of an argument, as He demonstrated constantly in the many addresses I have

heard Him give and the many more I have read. But it was not the logic of the schoolman,
not the science of the class room. His lightest word. His slightest association with a soul
was shot through with an illuminating radiance which lifted the hearer to a higher plane of
consciousness. Our hearts burned within us when He spoke.

(Howard Colby Ives, Portals to Freedom)

Welsley  Tudor  Pole

Although of a little less than medium height, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá made an impression on all
who met him by his dignity, friendliness, and his aura of spiritual authority. His blue-grey
eyes radiated a luminosity of their own and his hands were beautiful in their grace and
healing magnetism. Even his movements were infused with a kind of radiance. The most
abiding impression I received from intimate contact with him was his immense breadth of
outlook, permeated with the spirit of deep and loving kindness. Whatever the topic under
discussion—ranging from religion to weather, from the sunsets to the flowers, from ethics
to personal behavior, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá always struck the universal note, the note of Oneness as
between the Creator and all His creation, great or small . . .

(Welsley Tudor Pole, Writing  on  the  Wall, pp. 142-6)

E.G.  Browne

Seldom have I seen one whose appearance impressed me more. A tall strongly-built man
holding himself straight as an arrow, with white turban and raiment, long black locks
reaching almost to the shoulder, broad powerful forehead indicating a strong intellect
combined with an unswerving will, eyes keen as hawk’s, and strongly-marked but pleasing
features—such was my first impression of ‘Abbás Effendí, ‘the master’ (Áká) as he par
excellence is called by the Bábís. Subsequent conversation with him served only to
heighten the respect with which his appearance had from the first inspired me. One more
eloquent of speech, more ready of argument, more apt of illustration, more intimately
acquainted with the sacred books of the Jews, the Christians, and the Muhammadans,
could, I should think, scarcely be found even amongst the eloquent, ready, and subtle race
to which he belongs. These qualities, combined with a bearing at once majestic and genial,
made me cease to wonder at the influence and esteem which he enjoyed even beyond the
circle of his father’s followers. About the greatness of this man and his power no one who
had seen him could entertain a doubt.

( E.G. Browne A  Traveller’s  Narrative, introduction, p. xxxvi.)

Ali  M.  Yazdi

I went there often, sometimes on the way home from school, sometimes on weekends, I
spent most of my time outside of school in His garden. I would wait to get a glimpse of
Him as He came out for His customary walk or conversed with pilgrims from faraway
places. To hear His vibrant and melodious voice ringing in the open air and to see Him
exhilarated me and gave me hope. Quite often He came to me and smiled and talked.
There was a radiance about Him, an almost unlimited kindness and love that shone from
Him. Seeing Him infused me with a feeling of goodness. I felt humble and at the same
time exceedingly happy.

I also had many opportunities to see the Master (Sarkár-i-Áqá as we called Him) at
meetings and festive occasions. I especially remember the first time He came to our house
to address a large gathering of believers. The friends were all gathered, talking happily,
waiting. All of a sudden there was quiet. I could hear from the outside the voice of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá—very resonant, very beautiful - before He entered the room. Then He swept

> in, with His robe flowing.

He was straight as an arrow. His head was thrown back. His silver-gray hair fell in
waves to his shoulders. His beard was white. His eyes were keen; His forehead, broad.
He wore a white turban around an ivory felt cap. He looked at everyone, smiled, and
welcomed all with “Khushámadíd. Khushámadíd.” (“Welcome. Welcome”).

(Ali M. Yazdi, Blessings  Beyond  Measure, p. 18)

Florence  Khan

One evening, after sunset, Khan [Ali-Kuli Khan] came in great enthusiasm and excitement to
our room. ‘Do you remember,’ he asked, ‘that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said He would answer all the letters
we brought to Him from America before we left?’ ‘Yes, I do.’ ‘Then come quickly. It is too
wonderful! The Master is pacing to and fro, in His sitting room- I cannot see the secretary—and
He is replying to those letters, as if he had known the inmost secret of the writers’ hearts, from the
cradle! Yet He has never met nor seen one of them. You can see Him from the corridor beyond
the little room, each time He passes the open doorway!’ So, Rahím being peacefully asleep, I
returned with Khan, to his post, outside the doorway which led to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s long room with
its many windows looking over the Bay of ‘Akká to the Mediterranean and beyond.

I heard the dear Master’s beautiful voice, and then saw Him, as He strode by the doorway of His
lighted room. We were in the dark, looking through the small darkened antechamber. I recalled
how, never, at the daily luncheon table, and never at the late evening dinner, and never at any
time, had I satisfied my longing to gaze more fully upon the Master’s beautiful, noble, and
spiritual face. I used to glance admiringly at the snowy, scarf-enfolded headdress, and at the
beautiful, silver-white hair falling softly to the shoulders; and at the lofty arch of His forehead, at
the expression of His eyes, indescribable in human language; now they seemed blue-and now
brown- and again partly of each colour, or hazel—but always illumined, loving and
understanding; sometimes raised in holy reverence, in silent prayer, sometimes gently smiling-but
always kingly and supreme. . . Then, I could never get my fill, so to speak, of the Divine perfection
of spirituality—a gentleness-a holy patience—no sign whatsoever in lines or expression of the
lower traits of human nature, only a Divine perfectness. It was astounding. I had never seen a
face like it. Selfless. The stamp of suffering upon it; alas for humanity, which crucifies God’s
messengers!

“So, I thought exultingly, ‘Now if only the Master would pause a moment in His doorway, as I
am here in the dark, I could look upon His face to my heart’s content, and no one would notice
me!’
“Instantly, the Master stopped in His doorway.

“Silhouetted against the light, I clearly saw Him in His beauty, and I began a sort of ‘visual
devouring’ of that wonderful face! I looked, and I looked, and I looked. After a few moments,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá withdrew, and resumed His pacing to and fro and revelation of the Tablets.

“After watching for a while, half timorously the thought arose in my heart, ‘Oh! if only He
would stop  once  more in the doorway!’

“At once  the  Master stood in the doorway, silent, and seemed to be looking upwards towards the
stars. ‘Now, I will  look!’ I thought in breathless joy.

“This time as I gazed silently upon that matchless face, a golden light shone forth from His
entire figure. This light intensified, and intensified, as I looked, and looked, until I began almost
to be afraid.

“I said to myself, ‘However bright it grows I am going to keep my eyes open! What a wonderful
sight! What a miraculous opportunity!’

“The outline of light grew more and more intense, yet I looked, and I looked, until it seemed to
me, I must fall upon my knees. Just as it seemed I could no longer bear such a vision, the Master
withdrew.”

(Florence Khanum, The  Sheltering  Branch, pp. 26-29)

Stanwood  Cobb

And  so,  in  the  case  of  'Abdu'l-­Bahá,  I  noticed  upon  many  occasions  that  He  never  expressed
spiritual  power  for  the  purpose  of  dazzling  people,  or  of  winning  them  to  a  spiritual  allegiance  for
which  they  were  not  inwardly  prepared.    The  greater  the  receptivity  of  the  individual,  the  greater  was
the  revelation  of  spiritual  potency  which  'Abdu'l-­Bahá  displayed.    Thus  Juliet  Thompson,  who  painted
'Abdu'l-­Bahá's  portrait,  has  testified  to  the  glorious  revelations  of  Himself  which  her  Subject  at  times
made  to  her.    In  similar  vein  have  testified  the  Kinneys,  with  whom  'Abdu'l-­Bahá  spent  several
weeks.    And  May  Maxwell  once  told  me  that  she  had  received,  upon  one  sacred    occasion  in  the
presence  of  'Abdu'l-­Bahá,  such  a  revelation  of  Him  that  she  would  never  attempt  to  describe  it.  But
materially-­minded  people,  'Abdu'l-­Bahá  met  upon  their  own  plane,  as  He  did  Porter  Sargent.    And  as
I  also  saw  Him  do  in  Washington  with  the  Turkish  ambassador,  on  the  occasion  of  Mrs.  Parson's
reception.    This  being  a  social  affair,  'Abdu'l-­Bahá  did  not  play  the  part  of  the  Master,  but  the  part  of  a
guest  amenable  to  the  situation.    And  anyone  who  had  looked  into  the  large  reception  room,  as  I  did,
and  had  seen  'Abdu'l-­Bahá  sitting  in  a  corner  and  exchanging  funny  stories  with  the  ambassador,
would  have  seen  in  'Abdu'l-­Bahá's  facial  expressions  no  trace  of  spiritual  power.    For  He  was  not
here  primarily  for  spiritual  purposes,  but  to  play  a  social  part.

(Stanwood Cobb, In  His  Presence pp 57-58)

Albert  Vail
Bahá'u'lláh brought this great revelation to the world, but it came in Him with such
sublime light that people were almost dazzled by its splendour. His splendour is so bright
we can hardly look upon it. And so the next great Herald of the Kingdom takes the form of
a servant, the humblest form a human being can assume. He lays aside His title; He calls
himself simply, The Servant of the Glory of God.

He comes down right into the midst of men, living their life. He plants his garden; He
cooks the meals for the sick people; He makes them broth in the prison; He goes up and
down the country like a ministering angel of God's mercy; He is the tenderest, the
simplest, the lowliest of beings in the world. When He is put in prison for teaching
universal peace and universal brotherhood He counts this imprisonment the joy of His life.
'Abdu'l-Bahá tells us how when He was one day in the streets of 'Akká and the chains were
around His waist and His neck, the jailer, His tender-hearted jailer, said, "Why don't you
put a robe over those chains so the boys won't throw stones at you?" 'Abdu'l-Bahá, turning
to him, replied: "These chains are my badges of honour, my badges of glory, I could not
conceal them."
Now it is this quality of service, in annihilation of self, that makes God's Holy Spirit
manifest. When we visited 'Abdu'l-Bahá in Chicago and He met us there with all the
freshness and joy of this eternal morning shining through His human spirit in its
brightness and its beauty, and our hearts were thrilled with the consciousness that here
was one who saw God face to face, nay, that made God's love manifest right in our midst.
And He said to us, "You  know  it  doesn't  make  any  difference  what  happens  to  one  in  the
physical  world.  I  was  a  prisoner  in  a  Turkish  prison  for  forty  years." Then He told us how
He slept upon the ground or upon the stone floor, how He was starved and chained and put
into dungeons. "And  yet," He said, "every  day  when  I  awoke  in  the  morning  I  praised  God
that  another  day  was  before  me  in  which  I  could  serve  Him  in  His  prison.    And  every
night  when  I  lay  down  on  the  stone  floor  of  the  prison  I  thanked  God  that  He  had  allowed
me  to  serve  His  Kingdom  one  more  day  in  His  prison."
Then 'Abdu'l-Bahá, turning to us with a light in His face and a joy that was almost

overwhelmingly beautiful said, "I  was  in  prison  for  forty  years,  and  every  day  was  a  day
of  perfect  joy." As he said "joy" His spirit shone so bright that in our hearts we thought we
had never before known what joy and happiness meant. The people who were in the room
said, "Isn't it amazing; when we are talking here with this Servant of God, all we can think
of is God; we do not even see 'Abdu'l-Bahá." And one woman said: "I do not even know He
is here; all I see is the Spirit of God shining in Him as in a crystal or a diamond." When
she went away she did not think anything about 'Abdu'l-Bahá the human personality; all
she knew was that for one-half hour she had been in the presence of the eternal world.
Like a door into the Kingdom was 'Abdu'l-Bahá, transmitting the light of eternity. As she
left His presence she said for the first time in her life she knew that God was King, and that
there was no God but the God of this universe, and we could trust our lives to Him, our
fortunes to Him, everything to Him because God is the Reality of realities.

(Address by Albert Vail, of Chicago, 30 April 1919 from Star  of  the  West, XI:3, 28 April 1920,pp 45-57.)

Howard  Colby  Ives

So I was somewhat withdrawn from the others when my attention was attracted by a
rustling throughout the room. A door was opening far across from me and a group was
emerging and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá appeared saying farewell. None had any eyes save for Him.
Again I had the impression of a unique dignity and courtesy and love. The morning
sunlight flooded the room to center on His robe. His fez was slightly tilted and as I gazed,
His hand, with the gesture evidently characteristic, raised and, touching , restored it to its
proper place. His eyes met mine as my fascinated glance was on Him. He smiled and, with
a gesture which no word but ‘lordly’ can describe, He beckoned me. Startled gives no hint
of my sensations. Something incredible had happened. Why to me, a stranger unknown,
unheard of, should He raise that friendly hand? I glanced around. Surely it was to
someone else that gesture was addressed, those eyes were smiling”! But there was no one
near and again I looked and again He beckoned and such understanding love enveloped me
that even at that distance and with a heart still cold a thrill ran through me as if a breeze
from a divine morning had touched my brow!

Slowly I obeyed that imperative command and, as I approached the door where still He
stood, He mentioned others away and stretched His hand to me as if He had always known
me. And, as our right hands met, with His left He indicated that all should leave the room,
and He drew me in and closed the door. I remember how surprised the interpreter looked
when he too was included in this general dismissal. But I had little thought then for
anything but this incredible happening. I was absolutely alone with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The
halting desire expressed weeks ago was fulfilled the very moment that our eyes first met.

Still holding my hand ‘Abdu’l-Bahá walked across the room towards where, in the
window, two chairs were waiting. Even then the majesty of His tread impressed me and I
felt like a child led by His father, a more than earthly father, to a comforting conference.
His hand still held mine and frequently His grasp tightened and held more closely. And
then, for the first time, He spoke, and in my own tongue: Softly came the assurance that I
was His very dear son.

What there was in these simple words that carried such conviction to my heart I cannot
say. Or was it the tone of voice and the atmosphere pervading the room, filled with
spiritual vibrations beyond anything I had ever known, that melted my heart almost to
tears? I only know that a sense of verity invaded me. Here at last was my Father. What
earthly paternal relationship could equal this? A new and exquisite emotion all but
mastered me. My throat swelled. My eyes filled. I could not have spoken had life
depended on a word. I followed those masterly feet like a little child.

Then we sat in the two chairs by the window: knee to knee, eye to eye. At last He looked
right into me. It was the first time since our eyes had met with His first beckoning gesture
that this had happened. And now nothing intervened between us and he looked at me. He
looked at me! It seemed as though never before had anyone really seen me. I felt a sense
of gladness that I at last was at home, and that one who knew me utterly, my Father, in
truth, was alone with me.

As He looked such play of thought found reflection in His face, that if He had talked an
hour not nearly so much could have been said. A little surprise, perhaps, followed swiftly
by such sympathy, such understanding, such overwhelming love—it was as if His very being
opened to receive me. With that the heart within me melted and the tears flowed. I did
not weep, in any ordinary sense. There was no breaking up of feature. It was as if a
long-pent stream was at last undammed. Unheeded, as I looked at Him, they flowed.

He put His two thumbs to my eyes while He wiped the tears from my face; admonishing
me not to cry, that one must always be happy. And He laughed. Such a ringing, boyish
laugh. It was as though He had discovered the most delightful joke imaginable: a divine
joke which only He could appreciate.

I could not speak. We both sat perfectly silent for what seemed a long while, and
gradually a great peace came to me. Then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá placed His hand upon my breast
saying that it was the heart that speaks. Again silence: a long, heart-enthralling silence.
No word further was spoken, and all the time I was with Him not one single sound came
from me. But no word was necessary from me to Him. I knew that, even then, and how I
thanked God it was so.

Suddenly He leaped from His chair with another laugh as though consumed with a
heavenly joy. Turning, He took me under the elbows and lifted me to my feet and swept
me into his arms. Such a hug! No mere embrace! My very ribs cracked. He kissed me on
both cheeks, laid His arm across my shoulders and led me to the door.

That is all. But life has never been quite the same since.
