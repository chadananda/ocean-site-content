FOREWORD

Brief bio
Núru’d-Dín Mumtází was born in 1898 in Kás͟hán, Írán to Jewish
parents who embraced the Bahá’í Faith. He himself declared his faith in
the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh at age nine. Mr. Mumtází lived for some years in
the city of Hamadán, where he had a business and married Bihjat
Muraffah. Among his services to the Faith while living there were teaching
at the Bahá’í Tá’íd School for Boys and travel-teaching in surrounding
areas. He pioneered in 1953 to Japan and was joined the following year
by his family. He established a trading company but left its running mostly
to his eldest son and concentrated on activities of the Cause. Membership
of the Regional Spiritual Assembly of North East Asia from its inaugural
formation in 1957, generous contributions of funds and property, support
of the Publishing Committee, and numerous teaching trips were some of
the ways he served the Faith in Japan. He passed away in 1960.

The pilgrimages and memoirs
Firstly, the title given this document—“Twin Pilgrimages”—is the
editor’s, not the pilgrim’s. While it could possibly be imagined to refer to a
set of pilgrimages to the holy Houses in Bag
͟ hdád and S

͟híráz, in fact “twin”
here is just a fancy way to say “two” and refers to two visits to the Holy
Land.
Núru’d-Dín Mumtází had the bounty of performing one pilgrimage to

the Holy Land during the ministry of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in May of 1920 with his
elder brother and the brother’s wife, and one pilgrimage during the
ministry of the Guardian, in late 1955 and early ’56 with his wife (and
accompanied on the journey by Saichiro Fujita). His memoir of the earlier
pilgrimage was written up in 1959 (presumably from notes taken in 1920),
printed in 1995 in the form of a slim book in the original Persian as
͟háṭirát-i-Nuh Rúzih (“Memories of Nine Days”), and recently translated
K
into English. This account includes mention of meetings with Shoghi
Effendi in Paris prior to the pilgrimage and an epilogue describing the visit
of Martha Root to S

͟híráz in 1930. The record of the later pilgrimage was
dictated by Mr. Mumtází in English to his secretary in the late 1950s,
under the title “Excerpts from notes taken by Momtazis while visiting
Haifa, Jan. 1956”, and preserved in typescript form. Mr. Mumtází was
living in Japan at the time of the later pilgrimage and therefore parts of
the second account focus on the affairs of the Faith in that country.

Permission to make these English-language pilgrimage memoirs
available publicly comes from Mr. Mumtází’s late eldest son, Rúḥu’lláh
Mumtází (or Rouhollah Momtazi, a member for over two decades of the
Asian Board of Counsellors), who was responsible for having the original
first account published. The translation into English of the Persian text of
the first account was kindly accomplished by Dr. Ardeshir Khodadad
Forudi, editorially assisted by his daughter Shomays Forudi Dadfar. As a
young man in Írán Dr. Forudi attended firesides given by Núru’d-Dín
Mumtází. Dr. Forudi is a relative of one of Rouhollah Momtazi’s sons-in-

law, Bijan Dadfar, who contributed a number of clarifications of the
translation done by his relative. The English text of both accounts was
edited, and this foreword written, by another of Rouhollah Momtazi’s
sons-in-law, Sheridan A. Sims. A friend, Daryoush Yazdani (and his
correspondent as well), generously explained certain passages from the
original Persian text and sourced several quotations; another friend, Zafar
Moghbel, gave insights to passages in the second account. The editorial
work on the memoirs was begun, regrettably, after Rouhollah Momtazi
had passed away, and special thanks are due his wife, Pouran (née
Manouchehri), and his youngest brother, Abbas Momtazi, who both
helpfully answered questions about his father. Also, the youngest brother
(i.e., Núru’d-Dín Mumtází’s youngest son) was kind enough to offer
corrections and suggestions for the edited first account.

Something is usually lost in translation, and some things are not
amenable to translation, and so the literary qualities and perhaps even
the meaning of the original Persian of the first account may not always be
entirely apparent in the English version. Núru’d-Dín Mumtází had facility in
Arabic, French, and English to go with his native Persian, but he did not
speak English at a native level, and the language of the second account is
thus quite readable, and even eloquent in places, but also somewhat
awkward in other places. It should be understood that much of the second
account, too, is a translation, as the Guardian spoke to Mr. Mumtází in
Persian, which remarks Mr. Mumtází later rendered into English himself,
from his memory and/or notes.

The structure given by Mr. Mumtází to both accounts is numerous
sections, some long and some short, each with a heading. He gives only
one date pertaining to his pilgrimage in each account—May 10, 1920 and
December 27, 1955 (although the title of the second account specifies
January 1956 as the time of the pilgrimage)—and aside from the first part
of the first account, covering the journey from Írán via Europe to the Holy
Land, chronological sequence is often not clear in the two accounts, with
the sections organized mostly by subject. The title of the second account
says “excerpts from notes taken by Momtazis”, but if there is a fuller
version of the notes, including any record left by Mr. Mumtází’s wife, it has
not been found.

Editorial matters
Parts of the first account were not translated, and the finished
translation has been abridged and edited for style, while the original
language of the second account has been left almost entirely as Mr.
Mumtází dictated it. The only significant editorial alteration of the content
of the second account is the deletion of two sections where the subject
matter is rather sensitive; it was felt to be prudent to remove them from
this public version of the account.

The headings of a few sections in the second account have been re-
worded in order to more clearly reflect their subjects. Several sections in
the second account have been moved around so that sections with similar
subjects or themes are closer. A few new sections have been created in

both accounts where the original has thematically diverse content packed
into one long section. This re-wording of headings and creation and
rearrangement of sections has had no effect on content or on
chronological sequence (insofar as such order is discernible in the
original); an exception is the section on Hiroshima in the second account,
in which remarks made at the first two meetings with the Guardian and
originally recorded separately have been fused.

Both original accounts employ quotation marks to set off speech,
although the second account leaves the marks out beyond the second
page. While Mr. Mumtází indirectly quotes remarks or summarizes them
in some instances in the second account, mostly he seems to be quoting
speech directly, in the form of dialogues or talks; as such, the absence of
quotation marks after the second page probably represents simply a
typographical choice made to save time and trouble. The decision has
thus been made to add quotation marks to talks and conversations in the
rest of the second account for the sake of consistency. (The use of the
marks is further addressed several paragraphs below.)

The titles of works by the Central Figures are not italicized unless
published editions of those works are being cited (e.g., Epistle to the Son
of the Wolf, but Epistle to the Son of the Wolf page 117). Where reference
page numbers are given, these are usually to the most recent edition of
the publication being cited.

The system of transliteration for Persian and Arabic names and
terms adhered to in Bahá’í publications is followed; certain personal and

place names are given in their common anglicized form. As in Bahá’í
publications, pronouns referring to Manifestations of God and to the
Center of the Covenant are capitalized. Another practice of Bahá’í
publications followed editorially in the first account and by Mr. Mumtází
himself in the second account is the use of the singular form for Arabic
terms—e.g., “Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds”—where the grammatical number is plural,
with the English -s indicating the plural in certain instances. Also as in
Bahá’í publications, some geminate consonants are not doubled (e.g.,
“Ḥájí” rather than “Ḥájjí”). Unlike in some Bahá’í publications, Qur’án
verses are given the Egyptian, not Rodwell’s, numbering. Long vowel
sounds are not distinguished from short in the transliteration of Japanese
names in the second account. Idiosyncratic punctuation and capitalization
in the second account—such as “THOU” and “THEE” addressing the
Guardian, or “SOLOMONS FEET” (found in the final section)—has been
normalized.

Here and there in the original first account Mr. Mumtází illustratively
or epigrammatically cites verses from Persian and Arabic poetry as well
as from passages from the Bahá’í Writings that do not yet have
authorized translations; most of these verses have been paraphrased or
have not been retained at all in this translation, however, for what might
be called technical reasons. Honorific expressions recurring in the first
account—such as “the Blessed Beauty” (referring to Bahá’u’lláh) and “the
Blessed Temple” (referring to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the young Shoghi Effendi)
—have not been retained in the translation in most instances and have

been replaced by the familiar proper nouns or by personal pronouns; also
the pre-nominal “His Holiness” (indispensable in Persian usage) has been
dropped in most instances.

As touched upon earlier, the second account was dictated by Mr.

Mumtází in English, and although parts are quite fluent and articulate
some passages are unstylish or ungrammatical or have other mistakes.
To avoid editor and reader tedium, not all of these passages have been
“sicced”. Mr. Mumtází’s translation into English of Shoghi Effendi’s
remarks is often not eloquent, whereas in actuality Shoghi Effendi’s use of
English, both spoken and written, was highly so. However, inasmuch as
Mr. Mumtází’s second account is largely in dialogue or conversation form,
and editorially rendering it in summary form or substantially editing it for
style would involve re-writing it, Mr. Mumtází’s translation has been left
intact. Shoghi Effendi quotes a few times from the works of the Central
Figures in his conversations with Mr. Mumtází, and in those instances the
formal translations of those passages done by the Guardian have been
included in the Notes for contrast.

A few editorial interpolations are embedded in the main text in
brackets [ ], but editorial commentary has been placed in endnotes,
gathered in the Notes section, and indicated in the main text by numerals
enclosed in brackets. Numerals in italics following the endnote numbers
are the PDF document page numbers of the relevant endnotes. In the
Notes section the page number of the passage in the main text to which a
note relates has also been given in italics. Thus, in the main text [9;177]

would mean see note no. 9, found on page 177; in the Notes section 9;26
would mean note no. 9, relating to text on page 26. To scroll down to a
note and back to the main text, type the page number into the “Page”
space at the top of the document and press the “Enter” or “Return” key.
The “Drawer” function will display the pages in seriatim.

For those interested, the editorial comments give some perspective
or context, offer relevant asides and tangential tidbits, and explain
expressions like “9 Urdíbihis͟ht 1309” and “Hyogo ken”. Editorial
information has been gleaned from various Bahá’í and other sources,
mostly print publications or online versions of originally printed material,
but also some exclusively online. In a few places the editorial comments
stray into opinion: in these instances the above-mentioned helpful friends
have had no input and should thus be thought absolved of aiding and
abetting the editor in expressing any naff notions the reader runs across.

A single set of editorial eyes scanning a literary work is unlikely to
perceive every one of the faults of typography, grammar, style, or
information that the text and commentary will inevitably contain, and an
apology is offered for all such defects herein.

Canon and hearsay
So as to distinguish between quotations from the Bahá’í canonical
corpus and from literary hearsay—i.e., talks and conversations of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and Shoghi Effendi recorded in the notes of the pilgrim, translated
by the pilgrim or someone else, and constituting much of the text of the

present accounts—the canonical matter has been treated as follows in
the main text and in the Notes: the words of the Central Figures have
been put in italics and the words of the Guardian and the Universal House
of Justice have been enclosed by double guillemets ‹‹ ›› rather than
quotation marks.

For the above-mentioned purpose, the English-language canon of
the Bahá’í Faith is reckoned to be:
1} translations of the afflatus of the Central Figures, either

i} those done by Shoghi Effendi in his capacity as Guardian (and thus
absolutely authoritative), or

ii} those done by various individuals or by committees and authorized
at the World Center, or

iii} those done by various individuals and issued by Bahá’í publishers
before authorization at the World Center was instituted (this category can
be problematic), and
2} the messages and the letters of the Guardian and those of the
Universal House of Justice.
See the Wikipedia page entitled “Bahá’í literature” for more relating to this
topic.

Pilgrims’ notes in quotes and online
As mentioned earlier, the talks of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi
recorded by Mr. Mumtází have been enclosed in quotation marks herein.
The use of quotation marks for the “table talks” of the authorities of the
Faith may seem a bit reckless, inasmuch as notes of such talks are not

necessarily reliable transcriptions. Indeed, a letter written on behalf of
Shoghi Effendi to a Bahá’í publisher (see Lights of Guidance no. 1435)
discourages publication of works in which quotation marks are used for
the “reported sayings” of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, as this practice may give an air of
authenticity to such sayings.

It is a fact that some well-circulated pilgrims’ notes use quotation
marks, and leading Bahá’í publishers (the British Bahá’í Publishing Trust
and George Ronald, for example) have issued biographies and memoirs

͟hánum and Arches of the
(The Priceless Pearl by Amatu’l-Bahá Rúḥíyyih K
Years by Marzieh Gail, respectively, for instance) in which the marks are
used for conversational remarks of Shoghi Effendi. And even in
reminiscences in which quotation marks are not used, the comments of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi are often presented in dialogue or
conversation form (such as: ABC, I asked the Guardian; XYZ, replied the
Guardian), rather than in summary or paraphrase form. The intent of the
writers in such cases clearly has been to record the spoken word as they
heard it—or thought they heard it, or recalled hearing it—and the
presence or absence of quotation marks seems no more than a matter of
typographical formality. Altering all pilgrims’ notes of such form into
summaries before making them available publicly would amount to re-
writing them, which for the purposes of historiography would be a
questionable act. (Whether they ought to be made available publicly at all
is another issue . . .)
Concerning pilgrims’ notes online specifically, a letter written on

behalf of the Universal House of Justice (see www.bahai-library.com/
uhj_pilgrims_notes_online) states, “While wisdom should continue to be
used in publishing and disseminating pilgrims’ notes, the Universal House
of Justice has not formulated any guidelines or policies specifically
addressed to the content of World Wide Web sites.”

These issues lead to the following notice:

Caveat lector
Implicit in the editorial commentary is the assumption that Mr.

Mumtází has more or less accurately conveyed the remarks of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and Shoghi Effendi. Of course, the veracity of any pilgrim’s record of
the remarks of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá or Shoghi Effendi depends on the accuracy
of the pilgrim’s understanding, memory, note-taking, and transcription; the
competency of any translation, editing, and further transcription that
follows; and any conscious or unconscious biases the pilgrim may have
expressed. But regardless of the degree of care that goes into them,
pilgrims’ notes have inherent limitations—as both ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
Shoghi Effendi themselves have affirmed—and the usual advisory should
be reiterated here: The utterances of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi
recorded by pilgrims do not have the authority of the writings of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and the messages of Shoghi Effendi, nor should such notes be
considered a verbatim record.
THE TWIN PILGRIMAGES OF NÚRU’D-DÍN MUMTÁZÍ:

FIRST PILGRIMAGE (1920) —

“MEMORIES OF NINE DAYS”

Preface
He is God.
I have written this memoir while calling to mind
the late Dr. Yúnis Khán Afrúkhtih. He was the author
of Memories of Nine Years in ‘Akká, a memoir which
is far greater in every respect than the present
one. Yet accounts such as these all have the sign of
quaffing from the same bountiful cup.[1;176]

A brother’s favor
To begin with my story, it was 1920 and I was in
my early twenties. One day my elder brother, Mírzá
Yúsuf Munfarid, said to me that he intended to
travel to countries in Europe on business and that,
because he did not know any of the Western
languages, he wanted me to accompany him as a
translator and assistant. I replied that I would do
so on one condition—to go on pilgrimage to the Holy

Land prior to doing anything else—and my brother
gladly agreed. With utmost happiness and excitement
I made preparations. I bought two ‘abás of very good
quality, called “Ná’íní”, that we might each present
one to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. This act was to receive
blessings.[2;176]

Applying for a passport
In those days it was, generally speaking, a
fairly simple matter to get a passport. When we
arrived at the port of Bandar-i-Pahlaví I went to a
government office to apply. There was a noble clerk
who was in charge of the application forms. He was
so nice that he filled in the forms, and when he
asked me what he should enter in the “religion”
column I replied “Bahá’í”. Without asking any
further questions he wrote “Bahá’í” and said to
return the following day to pick up my passport.

I went the next day, but was informed by the
clerk that regrettably my application was not
approved. When I asked him why, he replied that it
was because I had specified “Bahá’í” on my
application form. He asked me to accompany him to

the office of the head of the department, which I
did. I humbly stood before his desk, but the
official looked at me and asked angrily, “What did
you write on your form?”

> I asked, “Do you mean ‘Bahá’í’?”
> He shouted angrily not to repeat that word. I
said, “Sir, I am a Bahá’í and I have told the
truth.”

The official seemed to realize that I was
truthful and firm in my conviction and he said
softly, “My son, we will never be able to issue you
a passport if you insist on using that word. What is
your previous religion?”

> I replied, “I was born into a Bahá’í family.”
> He continued, “What is the former religion of
your parents?”

I answered, “The religion of my forebears is
Judaism.”

> He concluded, “That is acceptable.”
> I asked the official, “Sir, is it justifiable to
write the religion of my forebears on my application
form instead of my own religion?”
He again spoke in an angry tone, “That’s enough.

You have no choice but to leave everything in our
hands.” The noble clerk, who was witness to this
conversation, asked me to return the next day for my
passport.

While I was outside I overheard the official
berating the clerk, “Why did you ask him to come
tomorrow? You have to harass such people and tell
them they will have to return after ten days or
more, so they might be discouraged from using the
word ‘Bahá’í’ on forms.”

The next day the kind clerk gave me my passport.

Now that I had it we decided to leave Írán on the
first steamer for Bádkúbih.[3;176]

Steamer to Bádkúbih
This was my first time on a steamer. On this
particular day the weather was pleasant and calm. We
were so happy to finally be on our way to the Holy
Land. It took our steamer almost twenty-four hours
to reach our destination. We were privileged to meet
some of the Bahá’ís on the day of our arrival, among
them Siyyid Jalál Síná. Later we met Jináb Javád
Fayyázuf and Jináb ‘Alí Ḥassanuf.[4;176]

Train to Tiflís
After an enjoyable meeting with the Bahá’í
friends in Bádkúbih we left that city by train and
traveled to Tiflís. In those days this city was a
beautiful place and had many tourists. For good
reason was it known as the Paris of the Caucasus. We
toured Tiflís and then departed for the city of
Báṭúm.[5;177]

Bringing my sister-in-law to Báṭúm
From Báṭúm we had intended to proceed to
Istanbul, but my brother said to me that he was
having second thoughts about going on pilgrimage
without his wife, Munavvar Khánum. I told my brother
that if he felt this way I would return to Írán and
arrange to bring his respected wife to Báṭúm. He
agreed and I immediately took the necessary steps
and brought my sister-in-law within five days to
join us in the nice hotel which faced the ocean. We
then made contact with the Bahá’ís of the city.

Seeing Jináb Zargarpúr and Jináb Tawfíq—

exactly as in my dream
I was asleep in my room in the hotel and I
dreamed that Mírzá Yúsuf Zargarpúr and Mírzá
Sulaymán Tawfíq had arrived in Báṭúm. In my dream I
asked them what had brought them here and they
mentioned that they were voyaging to Haifa to visit
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. I told them to be grateful that they
were visiting the lord of the worlds in this day. I
also told them to take heed, that He knew all that
was in their hearts. I asked them to be grateful to
God, and then I begged them to hold the hem of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s robe and beseech Him to aid me to
attain His holy presence. I was crying so much in my
dream that my pillow was wet with tears.

The next morning I felt so sad that I went for a
stroll on the beach by our hotel. Suddenly I noticed
from a distance two individuals approaching our
hotel. When they got near I was shocked to see the
same friends that I had dreamed about the previous
night. I embraced them and asked them the same
question that I had asked in my dream. They spoke
the same words as in the dream. I started weeping

uncontrollably and told them about my dream. They
promised that they would beg ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to aid me
in my longing desire to have the bounty of visiting
Him.[6;177]

With the flame of the fire of His love in our hearts

we continued on to Istanbul
We boarded the steamer for Istanbul and
gradually forgot Báṭúm and its beauty.[7;177] We
arrived in Istanbul after sailing for two days and
nights. This was an old city with many historical
sites. We respected Istanbul more than the other
cities because it was blessed by the presence of
Bahá’u’lláh, after He was exiled from Baghdád.
During those days the holy places associated with
Bahá’u’lláh were not specifically marked or
identified, but later most of the holy places were
purchased by the Guardian of the Cause. We are all
indebted to the efforts and sacrifices of the
Guardian in behalf of the Bahá’ís of the world. We
were happy to meet with a few of the friends, such
as Ḥájí Ḥusayn Shaydá’í, Mírzá Ḥusayn Mu‘allim, and
Mírzá Ḥusayn Tútí.[8;177]

We were lucky to arrive in Istanbul in early
springtime, as the climate was pleasant and there
were Naw-Rúz festivities in progress. We were amazed
to see one of the most beautiful structures, known
as the Ayá-Sufyá mosque. It is remarkable that this
mosque was originally a Christian church, which was
captured during the reign of Constantine.[9;177] The
dates for our pilgrimage to Haifa were fast
approaching and I was immersed in the ocean of
happiness.

My happiness turned to sorrow, however, as I was
presented with a big test. My brother changed his
plan and said he wanted to go to Europe before,
rather than after, the Holy Land. He explained that
we should first go to Europe, engage in business and
earn some money, and immediately pay Ḥuqúqu’lláh. I
tried to convince him that God is the supreme ruler
and He does not necessarily need to receive our
payment right now, but my brother insisted on his
plan. Because he was twenty years older I was
obliged to accede, although I felt deflated.

In those bygone years Europe was the center of
the world and the most civilized continent. People

longed to visit its beautiful countries and anyone
returning from Europe was very much respected by
others. But it was different in my case; although I
was a youth, I could not barter my love for ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá for the riches and wonders of this world. The
change of plan and further separation from the goal
of my desire caused me to fall ill and feel deprived
of everything. But I somehow knew a test like this
would happen, since it always did with those who had
the love of the Beloved in their hearts.

Entering Europe through Italy
Our steamer passed over the Mediterranean Sea
and we viewed from a distance the remains of the
city of Messina, which was destroyed by an
earthquake. It seemed as if the city was trying to
teach us a lesson on the mortality of this world.
After a few days we reached port in Italy. We
visited a few cities in that country and realized
the glory and greatness of Christ in this world. We
were unable to contact any Bahá’ís in Italy during
that time. We crossed the border and proceeded to
Paris.[10;177]

Arriving in Paris and seeing its beauty
While it had not yet fully recovered from the
effects of the Great War, Paris was a beautiful city
with much hustle and bustle.[11;178] But because my
thoughts were always centered on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, I
could not enjoy this experience—physically I was in
Paris with the friends, yet my soul was wandering,
detached from Paris and inflamed from separation
from the beloved of the worlds, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

The bounty and privilege of meeting and visiting

Shoghi Effendi in Paris
During my business rounds in Paris I was
visiting a large factory which was outside the city.
Suddenly by His grace I remembered that the Bahá’ís
would be having a gathering at four o’clock at the
residence of Madame Mathews in one of the hotels on
the Champs-Élysées. I hailed a cab and headed there
directly to meet all the friends.

On entering the residence I went to hang my hat
when I noticed a dark-colored kuláh on the stand. I
presumed any Persians visiting Paris would change
the hat they wore to a Western kind, and I asked

Madame Mathews if she could tell me to whom the hat
belonged. She answered that it belonged to Shoghi
Effendi, the grandson of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and that I
would have the pleasure of meeting him! As soon as I
heard the name of Shoghi Effendi I was overjoyed to
such an extent that all my pain vanished. At that
moment I realized that my brother had been divinely
guided to change his mind. From this moment on, I
felt, I must always trust in God.[12;178]

The room was filled with Bahá’ís. I had never
seen Shoghi Effendi, and I tried to recognize the
grandson of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Indeed I did, by his
unique eyes. Initially all seats seemed taken but
somehow one right next to Shoghi Effendi opened up
and I rushed there. I bowed and looked into his
eyes, which were the miracle of miracles. As soon as
I sat down next to him he said, “We were waiting for
you to come on pilgrimage. Your permission was
given.” I was shocked to hear those words and
wondered how he recognized me and how he could
single me out from among so many of the friends to
convey such glad-tidings. From that day onward I was
certain that he was a great personage with a great

station. At that moment I promised in my heart to be
his obedient servant.

Shoghi Effendi spoke for a long time in Persian
with Dr. Luṭfu’lláh Ḥakím translating. He mentioned
the troubles which surrounded ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Haifa,
about which all the friends were aware. He said it
was through God’s confirmation, mercy, and
assistance that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was able to look after
the affairs of the entire world single-handedly. No
one else could handle even the slightest load, by
comparison. Shoghi Effendi further said, “I wished
to assist Him for longer, but because of the
enormous demands of the work I suffered a nervous
ailment. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá—may my life be a sacrifice for
Him!—is a true physician for humankind. He told me
that I should go to Paris, that I should refer to a
proficient doctor, that I must stay in the Bois de
Boulogne Park, and that I should limit my contact
with the friends. He asked me to take complete bed
rest. I followed His instructions and found a
doctor. When I visited the doctor he said exactly
what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had said. The doctor explained his
reasons, saying the only climate that could cure my

condition was the climate of Paris and especially
that park. The doctor added that if I met with the
friends it would not be conducive to rest and
recovery. He also said that there was no other
treatment for my condition.” Those were among the
words Shoghi Effendi spoke that day.

I longed to see Shoghi Effendi again. After a
few days I told my brother and the other friends
that I yearned for the presence of Shoghi Effendi
and wished to visit him. They objected and said, “Do
you not remember Shoghi Effendi telling us in the
meeting that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and his doctor advised him
to limit his contact with the friends?” I answered
that I could not wait, that I did not know the
reason, but I knew that my heart was impelling me to
go and see him whether they accompanied me or not.
After a while they all said they would accompany me.

We made our way to Bois de Boulogne Park, which
truly had a pleasant atmosphere. Shoghi Effendi was
staying in one of the rooms in the only hotel in
that park. A security guard came to us and asked who
we wanted to see. As soon as he heard the name
“Shoghi Effendi” his attitude toward us changed, and

he behaved as if he had been in the presence of
royalty. He at once closed the buttons of his coat
and said softly that he would inform His Excellency,
and that if he approved we would be permitted a
visit. Luckily we were allowed to pass.

We saw Shoghi Effendi while he was resting in
bed, and we thanked God for the precious bounty He
had granted us. His face shone like moonlight out of
the bed covers. Although he was not feeling well, he
never stopped showing love and kindness toward us. I
can tell the reader now that Shoghi Effendi—as well
as the Center of the Covenant, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá—has been
the guiding light of all my teaching trips and the
source of the blaze of God’s love burning in my
heart.[13;178]

The graciousness of Shoghi Effendi
After speaking to us, Shoghi Effendi said that
he would like to return our visit. I was very much
ashamed and begged him not to take such trouble to
come to our hotel, but he insisted. He took out his
diary and said, “Does Wednesday at four o’clock p.m.
suit you?” We replied that his visit would be an

honor and that he was welcome at any time.

On Wednesday at exactly 4:00 p.m. Shoghi Effendi
arrived. It indeed felt such an honor to be in his
presence again. We humbly offered some grapes and a
cup of tea. O God, how his conversation transformed
our souls! Before he left I most humbly begged him
and said, “O Shoghi Effendi, we consider you as one
of the chosen ones of God. Would you chant a prayer,
that we may be successful in our pilgrimage and
visiting ‘Abdu’l-Bahá?” He responded, “Of course. I
will pray with all my heart,” and with arms folded
he chanted a soul-stirring prayer in Arabic.

Shoghi Effendi asked us if we knew which prayer
he had chanted, and answered himself saying it was
that which Bahá’u’lláh had often chanted before His
Declaration. Over a year later, upon the ascension
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, I realized the significance of that
prayer. As the reader knows, following the ascension
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi became Guardian of
the Cause of God.

This precious moment with Shoghi Effendi passed
very quickly and, alas, we were deprived of his
presence. But after a few minutes he returned to our

hotel and asked for me. He told me that he had
forgotten his umbrella in our room and would be
grateful to have it. I brought the umbrella and
thought to myself how such a great personage of the
Faith—the grandson of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá—could possess
such an old, plain umbrella.

Shoghi Effendi said lovingly to us that upon
arrival of our ship at port in Italy, on the way to
the Holy Land, a man would come and receive us. Sure
enough, when we arrived a man came on board the
ship, welcomed us, and treated us very kindly—which
was all the more amazing as Shoghi Effendi never did
ask us when we would depart for Italy and when and
where we would arrive.

The story of Ḥájí Akhúnd’s son
In Paris we met a man who was well known as
Monsieur Albert, but whose original name was Akbar.
He was the son of Ḥájí Akhúnd.[14;179] He showed
courtesy to us and recounted the vicissitudes of his
life. He said, “As you all are aware, my father was
one of the important persons in the Faith. He used
to hold firesides and deepening classes in our

house, but as a youth I did not like to attend such
functions. I wanted to be free and have an enjoyable
life. People assumed that I was like my father—
honest and trustworthy. One day, one of the Bahá’í
friends came to see me and gave me a large sum in
gold coins and requested me to give these valuable
coins to his relative in the city of Qum. Instead of
going to Qum, however, I traveled to Russia and
spent the money on enjoyment. I then came to Paris
and enjoyed life as a young man and eventually was
overwhelmed by worldly cares and bad habits which I
could not control. I was forced to sell all my
belongings—even my suits and shirts—to survive. But
my condition become worse and I could not even
afford a roof over my head. I became desperately
needy and thought I would die under such hardships.

“Then I remembered the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh and
the Center of the Covenant. With much difficulty I
procured a piece of paper and a pen and while
weeping bitterly I wrote to the Master: ‘O ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá! Thou art the only One aware of all my failings
and the secrets of my heart. If Thou wilt not come
to my aid, then who will? I beg Thee to forgive me.’

I could barely afford the postage. After some time I
received a tablet from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in which He
wrote that He was praying for me and that He wished
I would make amends for what had slipped from my
grasp and follow in my father’s footsteps. He also
assured me of His confirmation and assistance.

“On that same day I came upon the owner of a
paper factory. He told me, ‘Albert, you are a young
man and doing nothing. You collect this waste paper
that is scattered everywhere and I will pay you
well.’ I did not even have a loaf of bread and was
in dire straits, and so I at once accepted his
proposal and collected all the scrap paper. He was a
just man and paid me well. After a few days he
called me to his office and told me that he had
found me to be hard-working, that picking up waste
paper was beneath my dignity, and that he wanted me
to work in his factory and shop. I accepted and
worked hard and honestly. After some time, having
taken note of my perseverance, he told me that he
was pleased with my work and wanted me to be the
manager, and later a partner, in the shop. I agreed
and became his partner. After a few months he said,

‘I have tested you in many ways and have found you
to be a reliable and capable individual. I have a
beautiful daughter whom I love dearly; I suggest you
marry her’—to which suggestion I proudly agreed.”

Monsieur Albert took us to his house, which was
clean and nicely furnished. He told us that his
father-in-law had given him the house. But, he said,
all these bounties were due to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who
hears and answers the desperate person in need.

Meeting Mr. Scott
Mr. Scott was a very devoted and loving person,
with a white beard and a radiant face. The mention
of the name of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá brought tears to his
eyes. He said with a sigh that he was longing to see
Him and added, “When you visit ‘Abdu’l-Bahá you will
be detached from this world and whatever is therein,
save Him. When I had the bounty of meeting Him I
forgot this world and all its luxuries. When He
arrived at my house it was like Christ had entered
my home, and I have preserved the chair on which He
sat. Every time He asked for a glass of water I
would give Him a different glass; hence I have

several glasses blessed by Him. When I saw Him
inhaling the fragrance of a flower in my garden I
felt some ethereal connection between Him and
Nature.” Mr. Scott narrated many stories about
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, which my pen cannot describe.[15;179]

Proceeding to London
We voyaged to London over the English Channel,
which was quite dangerous in those days. Upon
arrival we went directly to the Bahá’í Center, where
coincidentally there was a gathering. I can never
forget the respect and dedication to the Holy
Writings shown by the friends. They were so absorbed
in the prayerful atmosphere that they did not move.
But at the end of the meeting they greeted us
warmly.

Regarding Yuḥanná Dávúd
In London I conducted some business with one of
the Bahá’ís, Yuḥanná Dávúd, and much of the time we
were together. I respected him because the Master
sometimes sent him tablets to be translated. Yet,
honestly speaking, I could not bring myself to like

this man. He was Persian but pretended to be
European. He never mentioned Bahá’u’lláh and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá with reverence, as all other believers
did. Gradually his selfish motives led him astray
and eventually he joined his brother, who was one of
the strongest Covenant-breakers.[16;179]

Leaving London and stopping in Italy
We made reservations for a steamer from Italy to
Haifa, returned to Paris, proceeded to a port, and
embarked for Italy. We had a few days to spare in
Italy so we stopped at one of the beautiful cities
with the best climate. This city presented a fine
environment for prayers and meditation.[17;179]

Arriving in Trieste and writing to Shoghi Effendi

We proceeded to Trieste, where I wrote to Shoghi
Effendi expressing my gratitude for his granting us
a new life. I requested him to kindly pray for me
that I might be able to serve the Cause of God. I
asked him not to reply to my correspondence because,
firstly, the spiritual connection I felt with him
was more than sufficient, and secondly, it would be

too much trouble.[18;179]

Departing for Alexandria
We left the port of Trieste on the huge Ḥilwán
ship and reached Alexandria in fifteen days. Upon
arrival there many Bahá’ís were present to welcome
us. We participated in their meetings, where they
chanted in the Ḥijází style from the Writings of
Bahá’u’lláh. After some time we managed to book a
steamer to the goal of our desire, the Holy Land.
The ship stopped at Yáfá and then headed for Haifa.
Entering the port of Haifa
It was the tenth of May, 1920, and our steamer
was sailing very nicely and comfortably in beautiful
weather. It felt as if the captain of the ship was
inspired to guide it into the port of Haifa with
utmost gracefulness. The cool breeze added to our
pleasure. Although we were enjoying this unique
atmosphere, our hearts were counting the moments
when we would fall at the blessed feet of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. My brother, Ḥájí Mírzá Yúsuf Munfarid[20;179],

and his loving wife, Munavvar Khánum, together with
this humble self—we were all so thrilled that our
pilgrimage was now truly to begin.

Gradually Mount Carmel came into view. The
mountain was rocky and uneven. The Shrine of the
Báb, a simple construction at that time, could be
seen. The view reminded us of the hardships which
Bahá’u’lláh and His companions endured reaching
here. We thought back to fifty-two years earlier,
when a ship carried Bahá’u’lláh here as a prisoner
of the cruel Ottoman Empire. And as I write this
forty years after my pilgrimage I am struck by how
different things are now, with pilgrims arriving in
the Holy Land from all over the world by airplane
and viewing a mountain adorned with beautiful
gardens.

A conversation with a Christian priest
While we were counting the minutes till we could
meet ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, we encountered a priest who spoke
Arabic. I asked him respectfully what was his
destination. He answered that he had heard ‘Abbás
Effendí[21;179] was a prophet of the East and that

he was going to defeat him. My brother, who could
not understand Arabic, asked me what the priest was
talking about and I told him the priest’s intention.
My brother advised me to convey the Message of
Bahá’u’lláh to him. I replied that this man acted
like a pharaoh and was filled with pride in himself
and his own knowledge and authority; he would not
listen to us. Surely ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would deal justly
with him and make him humble, and if it was God’s
Will we would see him again.

Arrival in Haifa
Upon reaching the port of Haifa and entering
Customs we were surprised by the fact that the
authorities did not examine our luggage and let us
through, on the basis that we were visiting ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. A number of horse-carriages approached us,
their drivers saying, “If you are going to the house
of ‘Abbás Effendí we will take you there.” We hired
one of them and asked the driver to take us to the
House of the Master. As we neared it, a wonderful
believer, Mírzá ‘Azízu’lláh Khán Varqá, came to us
and guided our carriage driver to the Pilgrim House

on Mount Carmel. We unloaded our luggage and
returned to the residence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.[22;179]

The dawn of our pilgrimage and our meeting

with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
After returning from the Pilgrim House we
entered the waiting room of the Master’s House. We
met there the priest who wished to defeat ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. The caretaker was Mírzá Muḥsin Afnán[23;180],
and the priest asked Mírzá Muḥsin for an
appointment. As soon as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was informed,
He told the caretaker to send the priest up.
Although we had arrived before him, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
called him first. We were a bit annoyed at being
preceded by this priest, of all people, but we
trusted in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s wisdom. After nearly
twenty minutes we saw ‘Abdu’l-Bahá signaling to the
caretaker to come upstairs. Soon after, we saw Mírzá
Muḥsin supporting the priest—who had nearly fainted
and was wobbly—and helping him go on his way.

Next we were given permission to go upstairs. We
climbed, kissing each stair, until we reached His
blessed threshold. No pen can describe our condition

as we bowed before Him. His Holiness ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
was at His desk, busy as usual writing tablets and
letters. He asked us to sit down facing His desk and
then looked at us and said, “I am viewing this sea
and I am sure that in the future all the kings and
heads of state will come to visit this place and
will carry bouquets of beautiful flowers in their
hands. In the future this place will be illuminated
all the way to ‘Akká.” We were thunderstruck by His
words. In His holy presence we felt we were always
under His loving care, protection, kindness, bounty,
and grace.

After some time ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked us, “How are
you?” We were dumbfounded and could not say
anything. Then He asked us if we had enjoyed our
voyage. I sat quietly. My brother, who was older,
summoned his courage and was able to speak a few
words in fragmentary language, replying, “The
Bahá’ís are well and active.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said,
“What you have witnessed in some of these places is
like a small flame, which may be extinguished, but
when the time comes the whole world will be set on
fire.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá then related that one day two men
saw Caliph Hárúnu’r-Rashíd walking, and one asked
the other about this man who strode like an almighty
king. The other said, “He is the mighty king of
earthly kings, but a humble subject of the heavenly
King.”[24;180]

After ‘Abdu’l-Bahá told us this anecdote my
brother and I thought of the condition of that
priest, who had acted proudly like a pharaoh but had
been utterly humbled by his meeting with ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. We ourselves could hardly bear to be in the
presence of this overwhelming spirituality. Then
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to us, “Fí amáni’lláh”. When we
rose to leave He added, “I will see you again in the
evening.”[25;180]

Later my brother and I were discussing the
meaning of the above matter, because we had talked
on the ship about the priest who wanted to defeat
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He must have been aware of our
discussion about that priest. We thought, “O
‘Abdu’l-Bahá! May our lives be sacrificed for Thee!
We are certain that these mortal eyes cannot truly
see Thee. Thou art knowing and wise and able to read

whatsoever is in our hearts.”

He was the Mystery of God, the exemplar of ‹‹He
doeth as He pleaseth››, yet He demonstrated

perfect servitude
After leaving the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá we
were in different states of mind which cannot be
expressed in words. In some moments we condemned
ourselves and thought about our neglect of His
commands and wishes in the past, and we despaired.
In other moments we looked to the future and hoped
to serve through His blessings, and upon this
realization we were comforted.

Soon we were all in His holy presence once
again, until late in the evening. After a moving
talk ‘Abdu’l-Bahá invited all of us pilgrims for
dinner and asked us to be seated. He Himself went
around the table and served us with His blessed
hands. We were saying in our hearts, “O God, how
great a bounty!” We were aware of the fact that
‘Abdu’l-Bahá had been conferred with all divine
powers by Bahá’u’lláh. I cannot adequately write and
express how His bounties showered upon us for nine
consecutive days.

How busy was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá replying to numerous

letters from around the world
No one can comprehend how deeply ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
Who was laying the foundation of the World Order of
Bahá’u’lláh, was immersed in the ocean of
responsibilities and difficulties. He was so busy
with His work that many nights He had no rest at
all. From time to time He would bring the tiniest
sample from his innumerable adversities to our
attention.

Once He made us aware of His travail through a
lesson. He had an enormous mailbox into which the
mailman deposited all the letters that were received
from abroad. A porter would then carry the mail to
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s room. Included in the mail were many
registered letters for which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
signature was required. One day Mírzá Badí‘ Bushrú’í
brought all the registered letters to His presence
and asked Him to sign every receipt one by one.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá had His head bent on His hand and was
signing them; there were so many letters and it took
a long time. Suddenly ‘Abdu’l-Bahá stopped, lifted
up His head, and with a loving smile and in a joking

manner addressed Mírzá Badí‘, “O man, what do you
want from me?” He looked at the pilgrims and said,
“This man is like a Qájár sword.” Then He explained,
“I remember that when I was a child in Ṭihrán they
referred to a Qájár soldier as a ‘sword of
Qájár’.”[26;180]

‘Abdu’l-Bahá next showed a sample letter to the
pilgrims. This particular letter comprised twenty
pages in very small handwriting. He said, “Just look
and ponder that the writers of these letters are too
many. Find a person to reply to all these letters!
It is thirty years that I have borne all this
correspondence.” He added meekly, “It is no longer
possible for me to undergo such hardship day and
night. I beseech God that the answers to these
letters be transmitted directly from the Abhá
Kingdom into the writers’ hearts.”

Early one morning He called all the pilgrims to
the room of one of His daughters. There we saw a
long bench piled with letters. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was
sitting on folded legs replying to them, and He
asked us to sit down on the floor. We tried to
imitate and sit like Him, but He was so

compassionate that He told us not to sit as He did
because we could not bear it, but rather to sit with
crossed legs, and we did so.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “Look at all these letters,
on so many different matters—and I must reply to
every one of them.” For example, one of the letters
asked ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to explain how this world came
into being. Another asked Him to solve a difficult
science problem, and yet another letter, which He
showed us, asked Him to kindly bless the writer’s
business. Another person wrote to Him that His
confirmation and assistance were awaited. Another
requested ‘Abdu’l-Bahá interpret his dream. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá said to us, “I need one month just to read
these letters. When do you think I will be able to
reply to all of them?” Then He showed us another
letter and said, “I received this letter four months
ago and I was able to read it only today.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá repeated the theme and said that He
had shouldered various hardships for a period of
thirty years but that it was not possible to bear
them any longer. He remarked, “If the friends would
detach themselves from the cares of this world and

with sincere hearts arise to serve the Cause of God,
then all their problems, no matter how difficult,
would be eased.”

My humble pen cannot write any further about the
hardships which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá faced, as He burned
like a candle in the darkness of this world. I saw
Him on one occasion walking in the garden and
talking to the pilgrims on different subjects while
simultaneously dictating replies to each of the
letters that had come.[27;180]

> Visions of victory and prophecies of progress
> One evening we were in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s holy
presence as He spoke about many subjects. Suddenly
He looked directly at us and said, “Soon wonderful
and great events will occur and the Cause of God
will be widely known.” Then He narrated a story from
the days of the Prophet Muḥammad. The Prophet
commanded His followers to dig a defensive trench.
While digging they came upon a large rock, which
none of them could remove. Muḥammad was informed and
He came immediately and struck the rock with His
staff. Then He declared that they had conquered the

Persian and Roman empires. His followers were
shocked by His statement and amazed at how He could
say such a thing when they were in such dire
straits, besieged by their enemies. But eventually,
of course, they did indeed conquer those places and
their celebrated monuments, such as the Arch of
Kisrá. At their triumph the Muslims exclaimed, “This
was promised by the Prophet!” We were moved by the
above story and were confident that we would also
see victories in this Cause.[28;181]

Every Sunday ‘Abdu’l-Bahá held a gathering of
the believers at the Shrine of the Báb. In those
meetings He was very happy and joyful. There was a
garden attached to the Shrine and everyone enjoyed
the heavenly fragrance of its flowers. On one
occasion ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to us, “At present rocks
and thornbushes surround the Shrine of the Báb, but
in the future this place will be encompassed by an
abundance of trees and flowers and will be visited
by all the peoples of the world. This Shrine you are
viewing now will soon be expanded and its
construction completed. In the future a kind of
electrical power will be discovered which gives

light from stone, and eventually the walls of the
Shrine will be composed of such stone.”

Again in His talk ‘Abdu’l-Bahá emphasized that
the Cause will develop and progress tremendously in
the future and I thought to myself, “O God! What a
bounty and privilege I am enjoying, sitting in the
presence of a holy Person whose majesty kings would
envy!” I wondered what the people of the world are
trying to achieve in their lives. If they attained
the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and were sincere, they
would surely have whatever they wished.

While I was pondering the prophecies that the
Master spoke of, and in awe of His divine power, an
old beggar approached ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and requested
alms from Him. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá with the utmost kindness
greeted him and inquired about his health. Then He
took out a silver coin from His pocket and gave it
to the beggar saying, “This is my last coin, and
here is half a cup of tea,” also handing him what
remained of His tea. The beggar accepted the cup
with much gratitude. I envied him as he drank from
that blessed cup.

Whatever happens, it will lead to

the exaltation of the Cause
One day we were in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s presence along
with other pilgrims. He addressed every one of us
with compassion and then asked, “Did you read
today’s newspaper? What is the news?” I thought to
myself that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is aware of everything that
takes place in the world and nothing can happen
without His will. One of the believers, Mírzá ‘Alí
Muḥammad Khán Dihqán, said to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “I have
read the newspaper and the important headline is
that Herbert Samuel has arrived in
Jerusalem.”[29;182] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “There
are many matters which are mysteries now and will
unfold in the future, but I cannot tell you more. If
I were to tell you about all the events that will
occur in clear tones, then you would understand that
whatever is happening now in this world must
eventually redound to the progress of the Faith.”

Another evening in the gathering of the friends
He said, “You, dear ones, must remember that
whatever happens is for the progress of the Cause of
God.” Then He gave the example of the martyrdom of

the Báb. The friends were distraught while the
enemies of the Báb rejoiced. But we should consider
that if the Báb had not been martyred, how could
Bahá’u’lláh have appeared and declared His Faith? He
added that later, as is recorded in history,
powerful rulers exiled Bahá’u’lláh. At such times
the Bahá’ís were disheartened while the enemies of
the Cause were joyous. But if they had not exiled
Bahá’u’lláh, the Cause of God would not have been
firmly established and propagated and the tablets
addressed to the most powerful rulers on earth would
not have been revealed. And so we have to conclude
that, indeed, whatever happens in this world is for
the good of the Faith and nothing else. Some
mysterious power is constantly at work.

Many tablets were revealed by Bahá’u’lláh on many

subjects and to the rulers of the world
One late evening the Center of the Covenant was
sitting like a bright candle with the pilgrims like
moths circling round Him. He said that in past
religions the holy scriptures had been in one style
of revelation but in this Faith the Writings were of

many styles and kinds, revealed as tablets, prayers,
treatises, etc. Then He lifted up His hands and said
that these Writings were complete and contained such
content as was perfectly suited to the exigencies
and requirements of this world.[30;182]

Bahá’u’lláh revealed tablets that even
prophesied the end of their reign for such rulers as
the Sháh of Írán, the Ottoman Sulṭán, and Napoleon
III.

Visitation of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh at Bahjí,

and protection from Covenant-breakers
It was nightfall and we were in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
presence. After showering His bounties upon us He
said, “We shall all visit the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh
tomorrow. I have instructed the members of the
household to prepare and bring your lunch.” We were
so happy to know that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would accompany
us to Bahjí that we were sleepless all night.

The next morning we had tea and rushed to the
Master’s House and waited outside under the
grapevine for some time. It was a little later than
usual that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came out through the back

door and said, “Praise be to God. I was eager to be
with you all at the Shrine, but I developed a fever
last night and I am unable to go.” We were
speechless and motionless as He left us. But
although He was ill He reappeared and said, “When
you are privileged to go to Bahjí, kindly visit the
Most Holy Shrine twice—once for yourself and once on
my behalf.” Then He said “Marḥabá” and left us.
We felt like a regiment without a commanding
officer and did not know what to do next. We were
also worried about ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s health. How could
we proceed without Him? We were perplexed. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá came out of His home for the third time and sat
down in a chair. He expressed His loving greetings
to all of us and said, “Now you must start toward
the Most Holy Shrine. When you put your foreheads on
the holy threshold, beseech the Blessed Beauty to
remember His servant, who is forbearing under all
circumstances and is imprisoned in this mortal world
and must communicate with all the friends in the
East and the West and see to the well-being of each
and every one of them. Also beg Him to send His

assistance and confirmations that His servant will
be successful.” He added, “Say to Him that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá is immersed in the ocean of cruelty and
injustice because of the misdeeds of the Covenant-
breakers and the enemies of the Faith. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
is undergoing these injustices so that the world may
be free of the bondage of suffering.” These poignant
words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá reminded me of His suffering
and the hardships of His life.

In order not to make us unhappy any further the
Master changed His tone and recounted an anecdote to
teach us a lesson. He said that once an influential
Muslim cleric made an appointment to visit
Bahá’u’lláh in private. The man arrived, kissed His
threshold with respect, and sat on the floor at
Bahá’u’lláh’s feet and kissed them. Then the man
lifted up his head and requested in a soft voice
that all the mysteries be explained. Bahá’u’lláh
raised His hands and responded that He had
proclaimed the divine mysteries aloud to the world;
it was strange the visitor was requesting to hear
them whispered privily.
The purpose of the above story was clear to me.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá was indicating to us that we should not
be deceived by the whisperings of the Covenant-
breakers. During this time, as is recorded in Bahá’í
history, the Mansion of Bahá’u’lláh was in the
possession of the Covenant-breakers, who had
forcibly gained control of it. They were like a nest
of wasps stuck to a house, and we believers had to
be very careful not to be stung. The important
“mysteries” were clearly revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in
the Kitáb-i-‘Ahd.[32;183]

‘Abdu’l-Bahá showered His blessings upon us and
ordered His own carriage to come and take us to the
Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. As soon as we reached our
destination a loud greeting of “Alláh-u-Abhá” drew
our attention to a man in his early twenties. He
started walking with us, as if considering himself a
member of our group. I asked him how it was that I
had not seen him at any of the gatherings and he
answered that he resided in ‘Akká. As we were
walking toward the Mansion of Bahá’u’lláh he talked
about how important this Mansion was, since it had
been occupied by Bahá’u’lláh. He said that he would
like to see the inside of the Mansion with his own

eyes but, alas, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had forbidden the
Bahá’is to tour it. I could see that his warm
conversation was deceitful and he hoped that I would
go inside the Mansion with him. Through this action
the Covenant-breakers would be able to inject their
poisonous venom into me. I realized that he was one
of those products of Satan that wanted to make me
like himself, one of the mischief-makers. I was
unable to tolerate him any longer and asked him to
leave. I told him that I did not wish to associate
with him or visit the Mansion of Bahá’u’lláh, which
his ilk had polluted. When he perceived I was
serious he vanished.

Some thirty-five years after this incident I was
on pilgrimage again, during the time of the
Guardian. The atmosphere had completely changed. The
Mansion looked quite different: repaired, appointed
in a dignified manner, well-maintained, and purified
of Covenant-breakers. The Guardian had triumphed
over adversity and re-created the Mansion. He hung
in it the certificates of recognition of the Faith
from many countries of the world. How beautiful and
appropriately decorated were the rooms in which

Bahá’u’lláh revealed the Word of God! There was also
the very simple room of the Guardian, but filled
with a magnetic power and spirit. This room
attracted the Bahá’ís to supplicate Bahá’u’lláh for
His confirmations and assistance. The Guardian had
converted the surrounding barren lands into
wonderful gardens.[33;183]

Coming back to the story, after that youth left
us alone we rested awhile and then visited the Holy
Shrine and put our foreheads on its threshold and
prayed for the friends in the East and the West.
After praying and meditating we were refreshed and
filled with the power of the Holy Spirit. Our group
members spread out and were walking through
different parts of the grounds. I sat down under an
old tree and was thinking of the future of this holy
Shrine, which will be the point of adoration for the
entire world. I was thinking that in the future
surely a glorious and befitting edifice would be
built around the Shrine.

While I was immersed in the glory of Bahá’u’lláh
and the Center of His Covenant, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, a
person approached me and disturbed my thoughts. He

said to me, “You have become crazy and have lost
your senses. Although ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is a great man, a
lovely soul, and a respected person, you imagine Him
as wise to such an extent that you think He is aware
of what is going on in our hearts. Do you not
remember that He said ‘Marḥabá’ to whomever came
into His presence, even if that person had committed
wrongdoings prior to gaining His presence?” I asked
this person to leave me alone. I was confident of
divine confirmations, and even if someone tried to
cut me to pieces I could never let go of the hem of
the robe of His divine compassion. When the man
realized that I was steadfast in my faith and that
my belief in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was quite different from
his notions, he left me alone and went away.

I was seated in the same spot with my head on my
knees when I saw ‘Abdu’l-Bahá with all His glory and
greatness walking nearby. A feeling of joy overcame
me and I awoke from my deep thoughts and ran after
Him, but I could not catch up with Him. I
encountered the dear friend, ‘Azízu’lláh Khán Varqá,
and I asked if he had seen ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He asked if
I remembered that the Master was suffering from a

fever and had not come to ‘Akká; surely He was in
Haifa. I said, “What do you mean? I just saw Him
with my own eyes. He was walking over there.” He
gently responded, “It is possible you saw Him in the
spiritual world, not in this world.”

Returning to Haifa and receiving ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s

infinite bestowals
We returned to Haifa the same evening in
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s carriage, reaching the Master’s House
and entering the garden. We saw ‘Abdu’l-Bahá walking
very slowly. This humble self lost all his senses
because he was immersed in the spiritual world and
thinking of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and repeating in his heart,
“O ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Thou art aware of everything in
this world. I wonder how Thou couldst be in Bahjí
and Haifa at the same time watching over everyone
with some means other than physical eyes.” After a
few minutes He inquired of our visitation of the
Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh. All of us bowed our heads and
expressed our gratitude to Him for His kindness and
bounties. Then He told us to stay in His guest room
where we would be served dinner.

During the previous days I would stand behind
all the other friends because I was of relatively
young age, but this night was quite amazing. However
much I tried to position myself behind the others,
some magnetic force would pull me to the fore. I
felt that there was some unseen power at work and
whether I wanted to or not I must stand in front of
the others. I saw the king of kings seated at the
head of the table and as soon as I saw that light I
felt I was losing consciousness.

I heard ‘Abdu’l-Bahá say, “In the name of God,
please sit down.” I came out of my reverie and heard
Him ask me again to be seated. I sat three chairs
away from where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was seated, but He
asked me to come closer and I sat one chair closer.
Again He asked me to come closer. I felt myself
unworthy to sit next to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá but He insisted
and I obeyed. I was thinking, “O God! What a bounty
that my clothes are touching ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s coat!”
As I sat next to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, with our sleeves
touching, I prayed that He would assist me to be
successful in serving Him and the Cause of God. I
was so thankful to the Almighty that I said to

myself, “O God! I bear witness that no one on this
earth hath had such a privilege as this—to be seated
next to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá!” I asked myself if I was right
in having these selfish thoughts.

Dinner was served. I took a small helping but
‘Abdu’l-Bahá told me that it was not enough and I
should take more. I said to myself, “O Master, there
must be a hidden purpose that Thou hast seated me
next to Thyself. I am certain that Thou wast present
when the youth tried to misguide me, and because of
Thee I could recognize him for what he was and tell
him to be gone.” At the moment I had this thought
‘Abdu’l-Bahá put His hand on my shoulder and said,
“Marḥabá, marḥabá.” Again I thought, “Someone tried
to distract me from Thee and tried to prevent my
spiritual flight in the heavenly kingdom, yet Thou
didst protect me. Through Thine assistance I did not
succumb to his misleading talk.” Again, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
tapped me gently on my back and said, “Marḥabá,
marḥabá.” Then I recalled the vision I had of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá at Bahjí. Again, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at this
moment tapped my shoulder and said, “Marḥabá,
marḥabá.” I took this as a confirmation—‘Abdu’l-Bahá

had affirmed the thoughts of this humble self,
thereby clearing any confusion in my heart.

It was a long evening filled with unforgettable
bounties. We pilgrims took wonderful memories like
these back with us, and they will remain with us
forever.

The spirit of the faithful servant . . .
He also mentions some deeds of the Covenant-breakers

One day it was morning and we were all seated in
the small garden in front of the flowers. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá was speaking about faithfulness. He mentioned
that those who served the Faith sincerely were
praiseworthy but that there were also some
unfaithful people. He pointed and said, “Look at
these flowers. They are beautiful and rich in
fragrance. I can sense their aroma and say that our
Ismá‘íl Áqá has tended these flowers well. I am
pleased with him, as with Siyyid Abu’l-Qásim,
caretaker of the Most Holy Shrine. But a former
gardener, named Mihdí, was not sincere. He served in
this garden and used to pretend in different ways to
be its protector. One day, he said that animals were

coming at night and destroying the flowers and
requested that someone keep guard all night. I knew
very well that he was lying but did not disclose it.
On another occasion he complained that our water
supply had been cut and uttered other such
falsehoods. I knew that he had had a direct
connection with the Covenant-breakers for many years
but I concealed his lies, shortcomings, and
mischief. And that was not all: other mischief-
makers would approach the pilgrims and claim that
they [the mischief-makers] had been in my presence
and I had given them my greetings and blessings.
They think I am unaware of their indecency, but
‘Abdu’l-Bahá is well-informed of the secrets of
their hearts.”

The next day ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to us, “The
Mansion of Bahá’u’lláh belongs to the Bahá’ís, but
it is occupied by the Covenant-breakers. I could
drive them out with no difficulty, but in my entire
life I have never harmed anyone and I do not wish to
make trouble for them.”[34;183] Another day a
Covenant-breaker came to visit ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He
seated himself next to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and spoke to Him

about many things. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was quiet and then
at last He said to him, “I will come and put an end
to these differences.” We looked at ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
face and He was very sad. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá later
remarked that these Covenant-breakers were extremely
harmful to the Faith of God. He quoted the following
verse from the Qur’án [2:14] and said that such
people had always existed: “And when they meet those
who believe, they say, We believe; but when they are
apart with their satans, they say, Verily we are
with you, we only mock at those who believe.”

During my youth I met with one of these
mischief-makers and I thought I would be able to
guide him. I asked him, “Do you believe in
Bahá’u’lláh—that He is the Promised One of all the
religions?”

> He answered, “Yes.”
> “Do you believe in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas?”
> “Yes.”
> “Do you believe in the Kitáb-i-‘Ahd?”
> “Yes.”
> I said, “There it is clearly written about
‘Abdu’l-Bahá: He is the Center of the Covenant.” I

advised him to seek ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s forgiveness—but I
did not trust him to do so. When he realized his
negative talk had no effect on me he said, “Fine, I
will do as you suggest”, and spoke no more.

We were immersed in the ocean of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
presence, and the odes of Bahá’u’lláh were chanted

On several occasions ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked one of
the believers residing in the Holy Land, Mírzá
Muḥammad-‘Alí, who had a beautiful voice, to chant a
prayer or sing a song. One night ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked
him to recite poetry. He chanted the ode of
Bahá’u’lláh in which He compares the physical
springtime and the spiritual springtime. It was
indeed a springtime—in every meaning of the word—for
us, and we were intoxicated with its fragrance.
The short woman in Germany who was followed by many

tall and hefty people
One evening while we were seated at the dining
table ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked an American lady about
another friend in the United States. She answered
that the friend was active but somewhat limited in

means. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “The services that have
been rendered to the Cause of God have mostly been
by such people. The rich and powerful cannot do as
much, and God will win victories through the poor
and powerless believers.”

Then He said that one day He was walking on a
street in Germany when He noticed that a short woman
—shorter even than our Fujita—was being followed by
many tall and hefty people. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked the
woman, “Who are these people following you?” She
said, “They are my children.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked
her, “You are such a small person, how could you
have such big children?” The woman replied that she
had taught them all the Faith; they were her
spiritual children. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá changed the tone of
His voice and exclaimed to us, “Such are the
confirmations of Bahá’u’lláh!”[36;184]

With a glance of the eye He could solve all the

problems of the world
We would form a line every day at sunset to be
under His kind and loving protection and to receive
the glance of His eye, a glance that could illumine

the earth at dusk and charge its atmosphere.[37;184]
One evening He was absent and we were deprived of
seeing Him. We were informed that He had gone the
previous evening to Mount Carmel to spend the night
in prayer and meditation. After darkness fell, our
most precious Greatest Holy Leaf sent a message to
us that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would be very late or would not
be able to come at all and perhaps it was the Will
of God that He would not be with us physically
tonight. She requested us to have dinner without
Him. But no one moved from his place, as it was not
possible for us to sit for a dinner without ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá.

After some time we saw the lights of a car and
presently ‘Abdu’l-Bahá exited from it, leaning on
the shoulder of Khusraw.[38;184] ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said
“Marḥabá” and entered the dining room, all of us
following Him. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá seemed happier than on
the other nights. I think He must have visited
Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb in His vision while praying
and meditating on Mount Carmel the previous night.
He was moving around the table lightly like a
butterfly and providing us with nourishment like a

kind father.

One of the pilgrims, an American lady, rose from
her seat and said, “‘Abdu’l-Bahá is tired, because
He met with many non-Bahá’ís during the day.” She
begged ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to get some rest. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
asked her to be seated and said, “The Blessed Beauty
created me not for taking rest but to serve the
friends.” He added, “Your souls should be happy and
joyful in this place because it is a heavenly place
with heavenly food. Walk after the footsteps of
Bahá’u’lláh and do not take rest.” No one could
forget such a glorious night with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for
the rest of his life.

At such a wonderful time one of the pilgrims
choked on his food from excitement. He was about to
lose consciousness and spill out of his chair when
‘Abdu’l-Bahá came to his rescue: He put two fingers
on the back of the man’s neck and he recovered
immediately. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá told him not to worry and
to partake of the heavenly food which had been
bountifully granted from the Kingdom of God.

The true holy of holies is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
One day ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said that those of us of
Jewish background, if we were willing, should visit
Jerusalem. Five friends said that they would go, but
I decided not to accompany them. They asked me if I
did not hear ‘Abdu’l-Bahá say that we should go. I
replied, “He did say so, but He specified anyone who
is willing to go. He said this because He knows I do
not want to go. Therefore the five of you should
please proceed without me.” But they persisted and I
explained, “This journey will occupy us for at least
four days and I do not want to deprive myself of the
bounty of being in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. The
reality is that the person of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is a kind
of shrine for me, and I cannot barter this for
structures made of stone. I can see the latter at
any time while my stay in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá is limited to fixed days and hours.”

Thirty-nine years have since passed and I have
never visited Jerusalem nor regretted it. The
precious moments I had in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá are invaluable, as they can never be
experienced again.

Teaching the Faith through storytelling
At nightfall ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was surrounded by the
friends, who were like moths around the candle.
Sometimes He would narrate a few stories, tales, and
jokes that we might learn through these how to teach
and talk with people.

He spoke one night about when He visited San
Francisco, where He went to various meetings and
gatherings of the friends and others. One day He was
surrounded by a group of people who said to Him that
He was speaking at all the meetings except theirs.
He replied that He would visit them by all means.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá made an appointment and when He
arrived at the place He noticed a sign which
indicated that it was a club for naturalist
philosophers and atheists. He met with a large crowd
of people. They assumed that inasmuch as He believed
in God surely He would speak to them about the
existence of God, and they therefore prepared
themselves with many questions on this theme.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, being aware of their intention, did
not directly address this theme and instead said,
“Do you mind if I ask you a question?”

> They said, “We do not mind at all.”
> He asked, “How many means of knowledge does
humankind possess?”

They replied by asking Him, “Could you please
tell us how many means of knowledge are in
existence?”

He explained to them that there are three means
of knowing things. One is the through the senses,
such as vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch.
Another means is through traditions; that is, what
is handed down from the great teachers of the world.
On this point ‘Abdu’l-Bahá told us that He
deliberately said “great teachers” and not
“prophets”, because the listeners did not
necessarily believe in the latter. He continued that
the third means is the intellect and reasoning.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá then rhetorically asked the
audience, “Would you tell me which of these means of
knowledge you think is superior? According to your
understanding, unless and until we sense something
we do not believe that it has an existence—is that
correct?” They all agreed that the physical senses

are supreme.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “Would you forgive me if I
proved you wrong?”

> They unitedly said, “Yes, please tell us.”
> He said, “I do not wish that you should be
hurt.”

> They said, “Not at all.”
> Then He told them, “You may think that the sense
of vision is supreme; however, imagine a ship which
is in motion—to the eye of a passenger on the ship,
it seems that the shore is moving.” Then ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá asked them, “Do you believe that Earth is
moving?”

> They said “Yes” unitedly.

He continued, “But when you look at the night
sky it seems the stars are moving, not Earth.”
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to the audience the idea that this
means of knowledge is superior was wrong. If sense
perception is the highest standard of knowledge,
then surely the grazing cow is the greatest
philosopher. All of them burst out laughing.

The next day ‘Abdu’l-Bahá arrived in Dublin and
the Bahá’ís came to receive Him. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was

walking with them when a few cows appeared. The
local Bahá’ís joked, “The philosophers have
arrived.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to the Bahá’ís that He
had spoken about this in San Francisco and asked how
they knew of it, given their town was nearly two
hundred kilometers away. They answered that an
account of the San Francisco gathering was published
in most of the newspapers. I realized how mighty was
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, to have addressed the people so
clearly and convincingly.

Then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke to us about the
naturalist philosophers of Írán. He said that they
were different from the atheists and naturalists of
the West. The naturalists of Írán would ask silly
things like why mountains are tall or why rain falls
in the ocean. But in the West they were more serious
inquirers and if you explained matters rationally
they would hear you out.[39;184]

Our visit to the public bath, and upsetting a groom

We used to sit down under a vine by the Master’s
House and wait to see Him as He was going to his
work room. Each day we were thereby able to quaff a

share from the cup of bounty, which intoxicated us
for the entire day. One morning we intended to have
a bath and, because in those days there were not any
private bathing places available, someone guided us
to a public facility. We found that the owner of the
public bath had great respect for the Master and
would take the utmost care of anyone who belonged to
the same Faith. After having a nice bath we were
filled with joy, having seen ‘Abdu’l-Bahá earlier.

We shared the premises with the wedding party of
a groom. A few of the locals wanted to get money
from him, as he was to be married the same day, so
they sang and played musical instruments for him and
were rewarded accordingly. When they realized that
we were tourists in their land they came over to us
and sang and played. Their song comprised words of
welcome to those who have journeyed to be in the
presence of their beloved. We were so happy they
sang a song about our Beloved that we contributed
more than what the groom’s party gave. Moments later
the owner of the bath quietly told me that he was
glad we were in such a good mood but that the groom
was quite upset we had upstaged him. The owner said

to please dress and leave the premises as soon as
possible, which we did. Whenever I recall that day
my spirit rejoices.

He was the king of kings, but He associated with us

clothed in a simple garment of servitude
Although ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was the most powerful
ruler on the earth, yet He associated with us with
utmost kindness and pure love in all respects. He
was extraordinarily selfless in character, and I
believe He wished for us to learn from His demeanor
and the way He treated others. His exemplary
selflessness cannot be expressed by words. An editor
of the New York Herald newspaper who was privileged
to meet Him once wrote that such is the effect of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s humility that a person
forgets he or she is in the presence of a great
personage.

One night He said that He wished to see the
Persians, the Westerners, and the members of the
Holy Family all dining together at the same table.
All the ladies were in attendance except for a few
who were serving in the kitchen. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá then

said, “All should come.” One of the servants went to
the kitchen and brought a few others. But ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá stressed, “All must come.” This time there was
only one person still in the kitchen and they asked
him to join the gathering and then everyone had
dinner together. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s love surrounded all
without exception.

Another night everyone was seated at the dinner
table busily eating when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked, “Is
Mírzá Muḥsin here?” Mírzá Muḥsin responded, “Yes,
Master, I am sitting here.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s inquiry
about Mírzá Muḥsin became a test for one of the
pilgrims and he asked me how ‘Abdu’l-Bahá could not
see Mírzá Muḥsin, who was sitting in the opposite
chair. I answered him, “If our Master, out of His
compassion for us, did not clothe Himself in a
humble human garment, how could an insignificant
individual like me be seated in His presence as
though with an ordinary person?” I thought to
myself, “O God! May my life be a sacrifice for
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who is so kind and full of unique and
genuine love and humility that it can become the
cause of negligence and tests for some people!”

Another night, when Khusraw brought a finger
bowl for the Master, He asked him of a mundane
matter, “Were plums not available today in the
market?” I overheard Him and thought in my heart, “O
‘Abdu’l-Bahá! Thou dost ask us questions, yet Thou
dost know already the answers. If Thou wert to
appear to us with all Thy powers manifested then we
could not withstand it!”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá entered His private chamber and I
could see Him with His hands lifted toward heaven
praying. His hair was spread on his shoulders; it
seemed as if each hair was also praising God and the
Beloved of His heart. I felt His power and it was a
confirmation for me of His reality.

Visitation of the Shrine of the Báb

in the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
Every Sunday ‘Abdu’l-Bahá visited the Shrine of
the Báb along with all the friends. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
would request one of the friends, who could sing
Ḥijází tunes in a beautiful voice, to chant the
Tablet of Visitation. The reverence displayed by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was remarkable. He walked with us,

rather than ahead of us, so as not to draw attention
to Himself. His movements within the Shrine were
very dignified. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá walked reverently,
almost on tiptoes, over to the man who was to chant
the Tablet of Visitation and took his hand and
guided him to a wall on which the Tablet was
hanging, and then He Himself stood among us in such
a manner that no one felt He was different from the
others. He showed such humility and reverence to the
Shrine and was so kind and compassionate that no pen
can describe it—but neither can the bright-burning
flame of the holy candle be concealed.

Begging to extinguish the fire burning in

an American lady
One day ‘Abdu’l-Bahá narrated a story with
utmost sweetness and humor. He said that when He
visited San Francisco everyone was on fire with the
love of God, especially the women. One of the male
Bahá’ís came to visit ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and requested
that he be permitted to speak with Him in private,
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá accepted his request. When they
were alone the man complained that since ‘Abdu’l-

Bahá’s visit his wife was so on fire with love for
the Faith that there was no longer any place in her
heart for her husband and the affairs of their home.
He implored ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to do something to calm her
down so she would not entirely forget her husband!

The effect of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s humility on us
My friend, Ustád Muṭallib, and I competed to be
more humble and meek than the other and walk after
the footsteps of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. We shared a small
room which only had space for a single bed and
required one of us to sleep on the floor. One night
after leaving the holy presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá we
walked to our room. It was bedtime and each of us
wanted the other to sleep on the bed. I said, “I
will sleep on the floor tonight”,   but Ustád
Muṭallib objected and said, “No, I will sleep on the
floor.” We started arguing loudly and Áqá Muḥammad
Ḥasan, the caretaker of the Pilgrim House, evidently
became worried and entered our room like a policeman
to inquire about our quarrel. Upon hearing our
explanation he commented that he had never dealt
with a case like this before, but after some moments

of silence he said he had found the solution to our
problem. He insisted, “Both of you will have to
speak the truth.” We agreed. He asked us our ages,
and luckily my friend was a year older than I. Áqá
Muḥammad Ḥasan then told us that the younger should
sleep on the floor.

How happy I was and how unhappy my roommate
became! It was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s teaching—that we
should prefer others to ourselves and be humble—that
was the cause of this behavior. I wish such
sentiments always existed among humankind. It would
make this world a better place and free from
selfishness. The world would become a paradise. [But
with the occasional loud argument about who can be
more selfless.]

> “Should a person say sincerely ‘My Lord, show
Thyself to me’, he will hear from the Kingdom

the reply ‘Behold, and thou shalt see Me’”
‘Abdu’l-Bahá always showered kindness and love
on the poor pilgrims like me—I who am utterly
powerless. He was supreme in generosity, like King
Solomon was kind even to an ant. Early one morning I
was standing outside the Master’s House. It was my

wish and desire to visit ‘Abdu’l-Bahá alone. I
remembered Moses, Who supplicated, “My Lord, show
Thyself to me!” and I repeated in my heart, “Though
wicked, sinful, and intemperate, we still seek from
Thee a ‘seat of truth’, and long to behold the
countenance of the Omnipotent King. It is Thine to
command, and all sovereignty belongeth to
Thee . . .”[40;186]

While I was immersed in my thoughts Mírzá Muḥsin
Afnán gave me the glad-tidings that I had been
permitted to visit ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. As soon as I heard
this I became a different person and rushed toward
His room, climbing the stairs in a hurry. Finally I
entered the room and bowed down before Him. He
looked at me and said “Marḥabá” and then told me to
be seated. I sat down in front of Him. I could not
say anything, however, as there was an important
visitor who was discussing a matter with ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. I thought to myself, “I wish this man would
go, so that I could be alone with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.”
This wish of mine was granted, as He dismissed the
man. Then He instructed Khusraw to serve me tea.
Khusraw brought us tea, but I did not want him to be

present either. Again, as soon as I had this thought
‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked Khusraw to leave.

I was now alone in His presence, but when I
tried to drink the tea I was paralyzed and could not
feel anything. It seemed as if heaven and earth were
spinning around me with great speed. I was losing my
sense of balance and the cup of tea was about to
fall out of my hands when I heard ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ask
me to drink my tea. At the moment I heard ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s voice I regained control of my senses and
drank my tea, but I still felt weak and helpless.
Just as Solomon was kind and compassionate even to
an ant, in the same manner I saw myself in the hand
of a mighty king. Then He addressed me and told me
to say whatever I wished. I spoke about my illness
during my journey from Istanbul, the illness of
separation from His holy presence. I also told Him
about all the events in Paris and London. I said to
Him that when I reached Haifa and came into His holy
presence my illness disappeared.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá then said, “What is your desire?” I
was sure at that moment that if I had asked Him to
grant me all the wealth of the world He would have

fulfilled my desire. But I replied, “I desire to
sacrifice my youthfulness in Thy path!” At that time
He was perusing a book, which was covering His face.
He took the book off His blessed face and stated,
“You will certainly be successful in serving His
Cause, especially when you depart from this place.”
After a few moments of silence He said, “Fí
amáni’lláh”. I intended to obey Him and leave His
presence but, for some reason I do not understand,
instead of leaving I threw myself on the floor and
kissed His feet and cried bitterly. He lifted me up
with two fingers under each of my arms and said,
“God forbid. Stand up.” But it was so difficult for
me to get up from such a calm and peaceful place—I
felt as if I was in another realm, out of this world
of consciousness. I heard the Master address me and
say a few times that He would surely and always have
me in His thoughts and I would not be forgotten. I
then moved backward until I passed through the
doorway. As I withdrew He addressed me with the
final words, “You will be very successful in a great
service to the Cause in the time of your
youthfulness.” I bowed again and left His holy

presence. I was in a state of numbness which I had
never experienced before.

The House of Bahá’u’lláh in Baghdád needed repair

One day, when my friend Ustád Muṭallib and this
humble self returned from the town, we heard that
the other pilgrims had been in the Master’s
presence. We were grieved to have lost such a
privilege. I asked one of the others if he
remembered what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had spoken about. He
replied, “Today the utterances of the Master were
very sad. He said that He has completed His work in
this world and must leave this mortal plane. But the
only matter He has been unable to take care of is
the House of Bahá’u’lláh in Baghdád, which is in
disrepair. He said that if the Most Great House
remained in this state His heart would hurt and He
would depart from this world in pain.”

That evening I went alone to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
presence. As I climbed the wooden stairs I kissed
every step until I reached His threshold. As soon as
I had the bounty of meeting Him I bowed with
humbleness. He looked at me and said “Marḥabá.” He

was sitting on the bed and the bedding was
supporting His back. As He showered His blessings
upon me I thought to myself, “O God! O Bahá’u’lláh!
What a glorious face, what a gentle smile! How
thankful I am for such a bounty.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, “What do you wish to say?” I
replied, “I beg Thy pardon for my absence in the
morning. I was told that Thou didst express the wish
that the Most Great House be repaired.” Without any
hesitation I quoted from the Kitáb-i-Aqdas: “Were
any man to taste the sweetness of the words which
the lips of the All-Merciful have willed to utter,
he would, though the treasures of the earth be in
his possession, renounce them one and all, that he
might vindicate the truth of even one of His
commandments, shining above the Dayspring of His
bountiful care and loving kindness.” I said to
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “I intend to contribute all my wealth
to the Faith. Please permit me to go to Baghdád and
repair the Most Great House and fulfill Thy wish.”
At that time I reckoned my wealth to be over 10,000
túmáns, which might equal 500,000 túmáns or more
today.[41;188]

After I stated my intention and requested
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to accept all my wealth He showered His
love and blessings on me, accepting my offer but on
one condition, which was a mystery: "Very well. Go
to Baghdád and get an estimate of the expenditure
and determine by how much you are short. Then write
and inform me. For instance, if you need five sháhís
and you have three, inform me of the
difference."[42;188]

I wondered why ‘Abdu’l-Bahá advised me to
determine what funds I had available and mentioned a
shortfall. I could not comprehend it then, but later
this mystery was solved: A cargo ship loaded with
the results of my business dealings in Europe was
seized by the Bolsheviks, and the associated bank
account was debited out—there was not a single sháhí
left in it. This loss, coupled with the expenses of
the journey to Europe and to and from the Holy Land,
made a financial commitment to repair the Most Great
House unrealistic for me.

O may my life be sacrificed for Him! ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá was aware of what would happen to me! Meanwhile
one of the esteemed friends, Ḥájí Maḥmúd Qaṣṣábchí,

requested permission from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to repair the
House of Bahá’u’lláh and was answered in the
affirmative. He was able to accomplish it and win
the game of service eternally.[43;189]

The future of Írán and coming under the shadow of

God, the Most Compassionate
We were in the garden under the vines and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was joyful. After He spoke about many
subjects, He turned toward a few of us who had
visited London and Paris and asked which city we
preferred. I felt tested and kept quiet, inasmuch as
He was the creator of Paris and London, and surely
He knew much more than we. But Mírzá Mihdí
Lálihzárí, whose voice and hands were shaking, said
humbly, “May my life be a sacrifice for Thee. In my
opinion Paris is very beautiful but London has
greater substance.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá next asked him, “Did you see the
Sháh?” In those days the Sháh would sneak away to
Paris in the guise of an ordinary civilian for all
sorts of dissipation. Mírzá Mihdí replied that he
had seen the Sháh dressed as a civilian and nobody

cared about him. As soon as he said this ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá became unhappy and remarked, “The affairs of
Írán have fallen into the hands of children and
those who have no moral compass. Their behavior is
such that there is no value or merit in the station
of kingship. It will take a long time for Írán to
rise up to its true station. They cannot develop
Írán, and whatever they accomplish will be short-
lived, unless and until that country comes under the
shadow of God.” Then He pointed to one of the fruit
trees and said, “This tree is green because of its
firm roots and if you take care of only its branches
it cannot survive.”[44;189]

The world is terribly sick
and the physicians incompetent
It is not possible for me to write about the way
‘Abdu’l-Bahá explained various subjects with the
utmost sweetness of expression and fatherly love and
care, not only for the Bahá’ís but for the whole
world. Believe me, if there were a thousand
secretaries to record His utterances they would be
helpless to do it. And so—please understand—how can

this humble servant write about Him?

Early one morning ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was in deep
thought when suddenly He became like a father who is
concerned about his sick child. He said that the
world is suffering from many diseases. There are
many physicians, but they are not sincere; all of
them only want to sell their own peculiar remedies
or cures. The competent physician has yet to be
found.

We thought of the verse, “A single breath from
the breezes of the Day of Thy Revelation is enough
to adorn all mankind with a fresh attire.” Yet
Bahá’u’lláh stated that the world must suffer
punishment for its misdeeds, although for the sake
of wisdom this has been delayed.[45;189]

Ḥájí Muḥammad the cobbler,
and the professional chanter of the Qur’án
Among the believers living in the Holy Land was
Ḥájí Muḥammad, who was a cobbler and from the city
of Shúshtar. He was a firm believer and something of
a scholar of the Faith, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was pleased
with him. One day a man who was a professional

chanter of the Qur’án came into the presence of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá and requested to be allowed to chant a
verse of the Qur’án for His health. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
Who was ever kind and forbearing, accepted his
offer. All of us were upset with the chanter because
we felt he was wasting the time of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
stopping Him from His talk, but ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself
was happy and joked with him. The man then chanted
the verse with an ugly voice which, frankly, got on
our nerves.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked the chanter to interpret the
verse he had just chanted and the man spoke
nonsense. After he finished his explanation ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá asked the aforementioned friend, Ḥájí Muḥammad,
to interpret the same verse. Ḥájí Muḥammad turned to
the chanter and said, “We are in the holy place,”
but the man could not comprehend. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked
the man how Ḥájí’s comment was. The man answered
that Ḥájí was quite wrong and there was not even any
mention of a holy place.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá then told him, “It is all right.

Now you can chant another verse and interpret.” The
man chanted another verse and gave his

interpretation, but it was filled with his own
imagination and superstition. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá again
asked Ḥájí to interpret. Ḥájí this time made it a
little clearer and said, “We are in the holy vale
near the seat of God’s throne.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
concealed His knowledge of the Qur’án and asked the
man how he liked Ḥájí’s interpretation. The man,
unable to comprehend Ḥájí’s meaning, exclaimed, “O
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, this man does not know the Qur’án at
all. His interpretation has no connection with this
verse.”

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Who could read every heart, again
told the man, “It is all right. Chant another
verse,” but He did not ask Ḥájí Muḥammad to
interpret this time and instead said “Fí
amáni’lláh”, dismissing everyone. Ḥájí later said to
us that no man could have explained clearly yet with
appropriate tactfulness to the chanter about the
station of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; that He was, by Himself, a
master of the Qur’án among so many other things. The
chanter simply was not capable of recognizing Him
for Who He was. Ḥájí added he felt that was why
‘Abdu’l-Bahá did not ask him to comment the third

time.

The next night ‘Abdu’l-Bahá showered His love
and mercy upon us and said, “Last night the man
whose profession is to chant the Qur’án deprived me
of talking to you. He thought that we do not
understand the meaning of the Qur’án, but marḥabá to
Ḥájí Muḥammad, who gave him a glimpse of the reality
of this holy place.” Then Ḥájí with utmost
dedication said to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that if He had asked
him to interpret for the third time he would have
told the man clearly to Whom he was chanting the
verses of God. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “No, no. That
would have been contrary to wisdom and I would not
have permitted it.”[46;189]

The honor of being in a photograph with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

The day that had been fixed for taking a
photograph with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came. The photographer
arrived at the appointed hour and arranged for the
pilgrims to pose standing on the stairs of the
Master’s House. We did one thing which had never
happened before: we brought a chair so that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá could sit. The photographer said that we might

as well remove the chair, because he knew ‘Abbás
Effendí: He always sat when the others were seated
and always stood when the others were standing.
Nevertheless we did not remove the chair. Someone
went to inform ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and after 10 minutes
had passed He appeared. He had been busy writing in
His room for many hours and was very tired, yet He
accepted to come and be photographed with us. He was
so weary that He could not even greet the pilgrims
with his customary “Marḥabá”, instead barely saying
“Mar” and sitting down. The photographer quickly
took the photograph and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá immediately
rose and left to continue with His writing.

In brief, that day a unique photograph resulted
from the chair we thought to prepare for our weary
Master. Our wish was fulfilled, as He sat like a
king while we stood like His subjects.[47;189]

Riding with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His carriage
Once during these days I was walking alone in
the streets of Haifa. Suddenly I saw the carriage of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá approaching. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked Khusraw

to stop and told me to board the carriage. I did so
and seated myself behind the Master. The carriage
was drawn by two fine mules. They pulled the
carriage so peacefully, and I wanted to somehow
convey to them that they were working for a truly
holy Person.

All revered His name
One day my friend and I decided to walk the
streets of Haifa. We soon lost our way and were
forced to ask for directions. We noticed a person
riding on a horse and we asked him to guide us to
the house of ‘Abbás Effendí. As soon as he heard
that name he dismounted and his demeanor changed to
one of respect, although he was not a Bahá’í. He
guided us with utmost kindness and then mounted his
horse and was gone.

Another day I was passing by a shop and saw a
portrait of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in a glass case. I asked
the shopkeeper if he could tell me whose photograph
it was. He answered proudly that it was His Honor
‘Abbás Effendí—God was first and He was second!
Another amazing thing I witnessed in the marketplace

and street was that people would promise or swear to
something by the name of ‘Abbás Effendí.[48;190]

The Master’s treatment of non-Bahá’ís
‘Abdu’l-Bahá associated with friend and foe
alike with absolute love and kindness. He was filled
with love and kindness for people in all walks of
life, whether rulers, government officials, the
sick, the poor, the wealthy. The poorest and most
downtrodden were under the shadow of His protection
and care. One day there were so many visitors that
He became fatigued. He said to us, “I have met with
more than one hundred visitors today and have talked
about matters I do not necessarily care to talk
about, because I conversed with them according to
their liking. If any of them had been a mischief-
maker one of you might have been harmed, but I am
immune to such effects.”

The fall of the Russian Emperor
One day during His talk with us the subject of
Russia was raised and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asked Ustád
Muṭallib, who was from Bádkúbih, how was the

situation in that city. Ustád Muṭallib replied that
the Bolsheviks were in power there. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
said, “The Russian consuls in Írán, such as in
Qazvín and Rasht, did much disservice to the
Bahá’ís. The consul in Qazvín caused difficulties
for Jináb Ḥakím Báshí. The consul in Iṣfahán invited
the Bahá’ís into his offices and then, in reaction
to the riots, evicted them. I sent a very serious
cable to the Russian Emperor and mentioned all these
cruelties to the Bahá’ís.” Then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá raised
His hands toward heaven and said with a special
tone, “The Emperor fell from power.”[49;191]

In the Bahá’í Faith there is not absolute equality,

but one should prefer others to oneself
Another night the mention of communists was made
and Dr. Ḍíyá Baghdádí asked ‘Abdu’l-Bahá what advice
should be given to the friends who inquired about
communism. He wanted to know if the communists
should be praised or their misdeeds mentioned.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá replied, “You must neither praise nor
speak ill of them. You should say that the Cause of
God has no objection specifically concerning them,

but the Faith teaches that each person must prefer
others to himself in all respects and that this
preference should result from absolute willingness
and love and sincerity and not from coercion. Also,
the ranks and degrees of the community or nation
must be maintained, because the population of the
world is like the regiment of an army: a regiment is
in need of a commander and officers and soldiers,
and it is impracticable that all have the same rank.
However, although ranks and functions may differ,
all must live comfortably; not some possessing every
worldly thing while others have nothing and are in
need of a loaf of bread.”[50;191]

How the servitude of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

could solve difficulties
I had spent two years in Baghdád looking after
my import-export business, and during this period I
had met Mírzá Muḥammad Ḥusayn Vakíl, the custodian
of the House of Bahá’u’lláh in Baghdád. Although he
was a trustworthy person and a firm believer, he
could be proud and stubborn and he tended to expect
everyone to accept whatever he said. For example, a

person would journey a great distance for the sake
of Bahá’u’lláh to His House, but Mírzá Muḥammad
Ḥusayn would not permit the visitation to take
place. Sometimes a person had to try repeatedly
before he would finally give permission. He would
claim that he was concerned about the safety and
protection of the Most Great House. I had once
traveled from Russia to visit the House of
Bahá’u’lláh, which is why I knew well of his
attitude. Many believers were displeased by Mírzá
Muḥammad Ḥusayn’s proud behavior, and some
complained to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá about his attitude. While
in Haifa I saw him arrive from Baghdád for
pilgrimage, and I was curious to see how ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá would treat him.

One day Mírzá Muḥammad Ḥusayn told us what
happened when he gained the presence of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá: “I was asked to meet ‘Abdu’l-Bahá alone. As
soon as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá looked at me I realized that He
could read deep into my heart. He came close to me
and took my hat off and kissed my forehead and hair.
He said that these had been touched by the dust of
the House of Bahá’u’lláh and were thus blessed, and

He had tears in His eyes. He asked me, ‘Do you know
that I am the servant of Bahá and the slave at His
threshold? Would you like to share this servitude
with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá?’” Mírzá Muḥammad Ḥusayn sighed
and said he immediately realized that he had
committed mistakes and was the cause of
disappointment to so many of the friends. He threw
himself at the feet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and begged for
forgiveness.

To briefly move forward in time, a number of us
pilgrims reached Baghdád on the same day while on
our way home from the Holy Land. Mírzá Muḥammad
Ḥusayn organized a feast and invited all the friends
and asked them to forgive him for his shortcomings.
He explained how ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had treated him with
the utmost love. At that feast the friends embraced
one another and an atmosphere of unity was created.

It was my desire to visit ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
in the early hours of the morning

and drink from the cup of bounty
Early one morning I awoke and quietly dressed
and slowly opened the door of the Pilgrim House with
great care so as not to awaken the others. I walked

to the Master’s House and when I reached there I met
Ismá‘íl Áqá, who was busy irrigating the garden. I
asked Ismá‘íl Áqá if ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was awake, and he
looked at me strangely and said, “Do you think there
is any rest for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá? From the break of dawn
He has been busy in His room.” I went and sat in the
usual place waiting to visit Him. I was thinking of
many different things including how I hoped ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá might open his window and see me and make my
spirit happy. Suddenly I fainted and collapsed to
the ground. Apparently Ismá‘íl Áqá saw me on the
ground and carried me to a bed which was down in a
kind of basement.

I do not know how long it was before I heard
someone calling me. I awoke and saw Ismá‘íl Áqá
standing by me. I asked him, “May I see ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá?” Ismá‘íl Áqá smiled and replied, “The Greatest
Holy Leaf has asked me to bring this breakfast for
you, because you left the Pilgrim House without
eating anything.” I sat up in bed and took the
copper tray on which was placed some bread and a few
pieces of cheese along with a pot of tea. It was a
heavenly repast. I realized how much the Greatest

Holy Leaf was occupied with various cares and
troubles.

When I finished my breakfast I saw ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
passing by and looking at me. I followed after Him
and found Him sitting on a chair with all the
pilgrims and friends around Him, like moths around
the candle, surrounded by the flowers of the garden.
He spoke to us on the spirit of service and
sacrifice.[51;191]

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s way of walking was remarkable
Although ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was in His old age in this
mortal world, no one could discern any sign of old
age in the way He walked. He walked with a special
and unique style. As I came down from Mount Carmel I
saw ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in summer-like heat with a parasol
in His hand and walking in that unique and most
dignified way. I bowed down before Him and He said
“Marḥabá” with His sweet voice. He asked, “Where
have you been?” These words uttered by Him—the fact
that He showed concern for me personally in the
midst of all His cares—were so moving that I wished
to fall at His feet and never get up until He

accepted me to be sacrificed for the sake of the
Cause. But He said “Marḥabá” again and continued on
His way.

Wishing to sacrifice myself in His Path,

and hiding behind the bushes
One day on my way to the market I saw some
people carrying a bed and other items for a wedding.
These items were so attractive that any youth seeing
them could hardly resist the idea of getting
married. I was a bachelor at that time and thought
that these things were nice but that a glance of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá was far more preferable and precious
than any material goods. I thought that I must
sacrifice myself for the Cause and beg Him to accept
my life in His Path.

That same evening ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke to us about
many different subjects, one of which was martyrs.
He said that periodically in history God’s believers
were able to share the bounty of sacrificing their
lives for His Cause. I listened to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
was intoxicated. Eventually He dismissed all from
His presence. I hid myself behind some bushes and

intended to beg Him to accept my life as a
sacrifice. I was sure that no one saw me, but it was
not the Will of God: a mighty hand pulled me out of
the bushes and promptly dispatched me up Mount
Carmel for the night.

No one was disappointed at His threshold
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s love and kindness extended to all
and through it people achieved their wishes and
heart’s desire. One day ‘Abdu’l-Bahá mentioned that
a person once came to Him and requested Him to pray
for his son’s safe return from war. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
prayed for him, and he returned home safely. Another
day I was in the Master’s House when He called me
and told me to sit down next to Him. There were two
Indians who, according to their tradition, were
massaging the feet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He said to me,
“These men say they are going to war and wish to be
victorious. They surely will be.”[52;192]

Joyous times at the Pilgrim House in the presence

of Ḥájí Mírzá Ḥaydar-‘Alí
On these days of our pilgrimage we were all

immersed in the ocean of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s love and
bounties. One could write a book for each visit in
His presence. To be at the Pilgrim House in those
days was unforgettable, especially because of its
simplicity. Our food was soup and pure wheat bread.
No one would exchange his simple soup-and-bread
lunch for a thousand roasted chickens. Sifting the
wheat brought us joy.

We were privileged to be in the presence of Ḥájí
Mírzá Ḥaydar-‘Alí, who truly loved and served
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Once I asked him to
explain the meaning of the verse in The Hidden Words
[Persian 19]: “O My Friends! Have ye forgotten that
true and radiant morn when, in those hallowed and
blessed surroundings, ye were all gathered in My
presence beneath the shade of the tree of life,
which is planted in the all-glorious
paradise? . . .” He said the verse refers to
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. I learned from him how to concentrate
on the Holy Writings.

The previously mentioned Áqá Muḥammad Ḥasan, who
was the caretaker of the Pilgrim House and other
places during the time of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-

Bahá, was a jovial person and every night he would
tell us all a story and make us laugh, such as some
of the tales from “One Thousand and One Nights”.

During our pilgrimage the Bahá’í community
suffered a great loss when one of the venerable
friends, Ḥájí Abú-Ṭálib, who was always sitting in a
corner of the Pilgrim House, passed on to the Abhá
Kingdom. During his long lifetime he was often
attacked by the enemies of the Faith. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
remarked that Ḥájí Abú-Ṭálib had managed a number of
times to fend off ‘Azrá’íl [the Archangel of Death]
and had even tried to redirect the Archangel’s
attention to Ḥájí Mírzá Ḥaydar-‘Alí! But,
ultimately, ‘Azrá’íl prevailed.[53;193]

The end of our pilgrimage
On the eve of the last day of our pilgrimage
‘Abdu’l-Bahá said to us, “Thanks be to God all of
you were assisted by Him to come and visit the
Shrines, which are the points of adoration for the
world. You should all remember that in this
visitation you have had privileged access to the
holy sites in relatively few numbers, but in the

future this visitation will feature thronging
masses.” He referred to the people of Mecca, who
during the early days of Islám called the Ka‘bah the
“House of God” and the pilgrims the “Guests of God”.
These titles were allegorical but these holy places
were a reality.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá added, “I hope that wherever you
journey you may go with the standard of God—Yá
Bahá’u’l-Abhá!—and that you may be the cause of
encouragement to others.” The pilgrims who visit the
Shrines are in a highly spiritually receptive state,
and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá showered upon us many holy words
which we soaked up like heavenly rain, giving us a
new life. We wanted to throw ourselves at His feet
and take the dust from His feet as a blessing. We
were weeping continuously and shaking.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá was so kind that He invited us to
go to the room of the Greatest Holy Leaf and view
the portraits of Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb. We went
into her room and sat on the floor in front of these
two holy portraits and inhaled their fragrance and
kissed them as a sign of respect and love and
dedication. Afterward we were in a dazed state and

forgot our way to the Pilgrim House, but we came
upon Mírzá Muḥsin Afnán, who guided us back. We were
inconsolable at the prospect of departing the next
morning and could not sleep all night.

The next morning we were informed that all the
routes home were closed because of the war. The
custodian of the House of Bahá’u’lláh in Baghdád,
Mírzá Muḥammad Ḥusayn Vakíl, told us that it would
be better to ask ‘Abdu’l-Bahá what we should do. We
all agreed and he went to inform ‘Abdu’l-Bahá of the
situation. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said the road to Shám was
open and to go through Shám. But Mírzá Muḥammad
Ḥusayn said to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that he had received a
letter indicating the route to Shám was blocked by
the French. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá responded, “I am telling
you that the Shám route is open, and you say it is
closed!”

Mírzá Muḥammad Ḥusayn seemed in a state of shock
as he recounted to us the Master’s words, and he
added, “It is the will of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that we
should go by way of Shám. So let us all go and trust
in Him, and it does not matter if we are all
martyred.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had said to us the night

before, “If you all go by way of Shám, convey my
love to Mírzá ‘Alí Áqá and tell him that ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá says he has not been forgotten; I do remember
him.” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá knew that we would have to travel
to Shám.[54;193]

With broken hearts we were going on our way when
we saw a figure from afar. When we got closer we saw
‘Abdu’l-Bahá seated, with His blessed hair falling
on His shoulders. This last meeting was a
consolation for our hearts, courtesy of the Master.
He greeted us and then said “Fí amáni’lláh” [“Be in
the protection of God”]. This brought an end to our
pilgrimage.

My pen is unable to record all the things which
happened in His holy presence. If a thousand
secretaries were to write down ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
remarks and talks, they would surely fail to record
everything. In His presence we were transformed into
spiritually charged beings, like the disciples of
Christ. When He rose to His feet and started
walking, we followed Him. We walked through the
streets praising His name, which was known to
everyone.

When we reached the main road ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
ordered Khusraw to stop His carriage and told us to
climb in. We dropped ourselves at His feet and
inhaled the fragrance of His pure love, while I was
repeating in my heart one of the prayers of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá. By the Will of God we boarded the carriage.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá walked with us for some time and then
turned into a lane, and we could no longer see Him.
We will never forget how ‘Abdu’l-Bahá walked with us
as we rode in His carriage.

Epilogue: The loving heart
9 Urdíbihisht 1309 marked the arrival of Ms.

Martha Root in Shíráz. It was springtime and the
flowers were blooming and their fragrance filled the
air with perfume.[55;194]

Some kilometers away from the city the
automobile carrying her was approached by a number
of persons riding on horses. As soon as they came
close they gave their greetings and conveyed
messages on behalf of the thousands of Bahá’ís in
the city and its vicinity. The horsemen then bowed
and proceeded to perform fine acrobatics.

Ms. Root and her companions were guided to the
ancient ruins of the famed Persepolis. She viewed
the ruins and praised that amazing spot. Ms. Root
saw the Bahá’ís crying with happiness, moved to
tears to hear an American lady praising Írán.

A shepherd arrived at the gathering from a far
distance, having left his flock behind. He shook
hands with Ms. Root. He was uneducated but spoke
with sincerity and eloquence. He said that during
the prime of his life his fellow shepherds used to
mock him and torment him by doing things like
pressing pebbles painfully against his ear. They did
this because he was a Bahá’í. Although the majority
of those cruel people were no longer in this world,
he wished that they could raise their heads out of
their graves and see the greatness of this Faith. He
was so excited that he took his hat off and,
according to his tradition, threw it toward heaven
twice and shouted at the top of his voice, “Yá
Bahá’u’l-Abhá!” Everyone was thrilled and applauded
him. Lunch was served in honor of Ms. Root and all
enjoyed a picnic. It was a lovely moment when Ms.
Root distributed copies of a photograph of ‘Abdu’l-

Bahá which she had brought from America.

Buses came carrying more people to welcome Ms.

Martha Root, and the entire gathering then headed
for the cradle of the Faith. Ms. Root and her fellow
travelers admired beautiful gardens full of flowers
of different aromas and colors and nightingales
singing their sweet melodies. They passed through
the narrow streets of Shíráz and reached the
residence of the Dihqán family, one of the prominent
Bahá’í houses in the city. Moved by the atmosphere
of the city Ms. Root started to cry, tears rolling
down her cheeks. Although Ms. Root was comfortable
and every possible thing was arranged for her, she
was uneasy and waited for the Bahá’ís to take her to
the blessed House. It was on 5 May 1930 that the
Bahá’ís guided her to the House of the Báb.[56;194]

Ms. Martha Root associated with kings and queens
and heads of state everywhere, but now for the sake
of the Cause of God she was experiencing these dark
and narrow streets with long passages, which she
preferred to the world of wealth and beauty and
comfort. After a long walk, joy building with each
step, the visitation party reached the House of the

Báb. The Afnán custodians of the House suggested
that Ms. Root rest in another room for some time and
partake of refreshments before proceeding to the
room of revelation, but she declined to rest even
for a moment. She asked the Afnán family about the
Báb and His Writings and she recorded everything in
her diary. Presently one of the Afnán brought a
metal trunk full of the Writings of the Báb. It was
rusty and the contents damaged by moisture, because
during the riots and turmoil in Írán they were
forced to bury it in the earth. Ms. Root did not
care about the rusted trunk or the ugly effect of
the moisture. She kept her face on that trunk and
kissed it until the people thought she would surely
take off all of its rust.

The House of the Báb had a soul-stirring aura.

It consisted of three sections, the highest of which
was the chamber where Mullá Ḥusayn received the
Message and other tablets were revealed. Before
visiting this room Ms. Root viewed the orange tree
which had been planted by the Báb Himself. Then Ms.
Root—who had traveled the world over and mentioned
the name of Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb everywhere and

had come with utmost humbleness as a pilgrim—saw
with her own eyes the blessed chamber. She kissed
even the walls of the room and while doing so was
remembering all the Bahá’í friends around the world.

A meeting was held at the home of Mr. Munajjim
at which Ms. Root spoke. There was an overflowing
crowd, both Bahá’ís and non-Bahá’ís. Ms. Root
delivered a beautiful talk about the Báb and His new
Revelation. A second meeting was held in the same
house and Ms. Root lectured about the development
and progress of the Faith in the West. A third
meeting was arranged in Muḥammadíyyih Garden. The
friends decorated this beautiful garden with banners
containing the Greatest Name and with framed verses
from the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb, such
as “Ye are the fruits of one tree and the leaves of
one branch.”

The number in attendance at Muḥammadíyyih Garden
was not less than two thousand, and they heard songs
most movingly sung by the Bahá’í children as well as
a powerful talk by Ms. Root. She spoke about the
visit of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the West and His many
accomplishments, and she also addressed the many

Muslims and several Christian priests and
missionaries in the audience, telling them that they
had misunderstood each other’s Faiths. By so doing
she was able to remove the barriers between the
adherents of these Faiths, and in fact some among
the Muslims praised her for mentioning the names of
all religions with reverence. She ended her talk by
saying that whosoever was from Shíráz should be
proud of his or her native city because it was a
holy place and in the future it would be visited by
kings and heads of state with utmost respect. After
the conclusion of her talk the applause continued on
and on.

Ms. Root visited the House of the Báb a second
time, wearing a simple white dress. There was a
photographer who was from a Bahá’í family but knew
little about the Faith. He was astonished by the
dedication of our dear and respected Ms. Root. She
took out her watch and presented it to the
photographer for his efforts. The photographer was
shaken and discovered for himself that this House in
Shíráz was not, as he may have thought, any ordinary
house. Ms. Root plucked leaves from the orange tree

planted by the Báb to send to the United States.

This writer was privileged to be in Ms. Martha
Root’s service during her visit to Shíráz and
Iṣfahán. He witnessed these events—yet no words can
possibly express the spirituality of Ms. Root and
her dedication to the Cause of God.[57;194]
THE TWIN PILGRIMAGES OF NÚRU’D-DÍN MUMTÁZÍ:

SECOND PILGRIMAGE (1955-56) —

“EXCERPTS FROM NOTES TAKEN BY MOMTAZIS

WHILE VISITING HAIFA, JAN. 1956”

Arrival in Haifa
Our car is taking the Tel Aviv-Haifa road. We
are near to our beloved Guardian now. The time of
attainment is near: our hearts—my and my wife’s—are
beating fast. All we are thinking of is how we must
present ourselves before our beloved Guardian.

We have come a long way but the dome of the
Shrine is not visible yet. We cannot wait any longer
and everyone is anxious to meet our beloved
Guardian.

Alas [sic], here is the dome. We can see it
clearly now. Our hearts are beating faster. This
sign speaks to us: it tells us that the time of
attainment is near and that we do not have to wait
much longer.

We are now in Haifa but we do not know where to
go in this strange place and yet in this holy city:

to the Pilgrim House or to the sacred residence of
our beloved Guardian. One of us suggested that we
ring the bell [telephone?] of his residence and ask
for advice, but while this state of confusion was
prevailing Fujita called a taxi and told him to
drive toward our beloved Guardian’s residence. We
got into the taxi and with extraordinary speed the
driver took us to his sacred residence.[58;195]

When entering our beloved Guardian’s residence
[at 7 HaParsim Street] we saw the familiar words [on
the nameplate]—ABDUL-BAHA ABBAS—all of which
reminded me of my previous visit to this holy place
in 1920, 35 years ago. We kissed these sacred words
while we were head-over-heels in confusion. The
sacred door was opened and Fujita, who was walking
ahead of us, was the first to enter it. From a far
distance we could see our sacred second [sic]
Amatu’l-Bahá Rúḥíyyih Khánum.

We were now in complete ignorance and no one
knows when we are destined to meet our beloved
Guardian, who, as we learned later, was already
informed that pilgrims from the Far East—the
farthest place from the Holy Land—have come to him

and with humble hearts are waiting to meet him. His
ocean of mercy was touched and we were immediately
called to his presence.[59;195]

First meeting with our beloved Guardian
The time had come when the voice of God would
speak to us. Finally our sufferings came to an end
and his door was opened unto us. Fujita and I had
lost our minds and all we knew was that we were at
his holy feet. He tried to lift us up but, alas, our
hands were tightly bound to his holy feet. Fujita
and I each had one of his holy feet in our hands.
Fujita was told to stand up, but since he was told
so in English I took it as being addressed only to
him and not to me. When the same was addressed to me
and I was told to stand up Fujita took advantage of
the situation and thus each of us was again holding
one of his holy feet in his arms.

Here was my reward after 35 years of depression
and suffering. I was depressed since I had been so
far from our beloved Guardian and I had suffered
greatly as I was unable to attend and serve him from
close. This was our situation for a few minutes

until Fujita and I were somehow unconsciously and
with the help of our beloved Guardian lifted up and
stood humbly in his presence. We were all wet with
tears at this moment and only those who have had the
happiness and privilege to visit our beloved
Guardian know what these tears meant to us.

It was at this moment that my wife arrived and,
ignorant of our presence, threw herself on his holy
feet, and since she was alone she had his two feet
in her arms. She was kissing his feet and her voice,
which was coming deep from her heart, was repeatedly
heard saying “My soul be sacrificed to thou” until
she too was unconsciously lifted up with his help
and stood humbly at his presence. It was then and
there that she observed us in his presence.

Our beloved Guardian asked us to be seated, and
then his holy voice spoke to us: “You have come a
long way, leaving seas and skies behind yourselves
to come to me. You are welcome. I was waiting for
you.” The he asked us if we had any delay on our
way, stressing that we had come a little late.
“Thanks [be] to God that you have pioneered to

Japan,” said our beloved Guardian. “The Faith of God
has made great progress in Japan and, with your
efforts, devotion, and determination, Bahá’í centers
have been set up [i.e., established] all over Japan
for the activities of our friends in this country. I
have always looked with appreciation on your
services, all of which will be recorded in history.
Now we are at the beginning of the Administration
[sic] Order of Japan; in the future you will face
big victories and successes in that country. I am
delighted with your faithful services in Japan. Do
not weep—now is the moment of your happiness. Thanks
[be to] God that you have made great progress in
Japan. This progress is both in spirit and in
organizing the Administration Order in that
country.”[61;195]

Then our beloved Guardian asked me, “How are our
friends in Japan?”

“All of them are continuing their sincere
services to thee with faith and diligence,” I
replied, “and all they ask for is your help and
blessings.”
“Thanks [be to] God,” said our beloved Guardian,

“that our friends are all determined and sincere to
the Faith irrespective of their nationality, whether
they are Íránian, Japanese, or American. You have
had the great privilege of visiting the Holy Land,”
our beloved Guardian said, “while this visit was
very difficult during the time of His Holiness
Bahá’u’lláh. Our friends had to travel for six
months in those times in order to come to the Holy
Land, while they could stay here only for a few
minutes and Bahá’u’lláh could only have a look on
them. They could never stay in His presence for more
than a few moments. Now the situation is changed,
but you must value this precious occasion.” Turning
toward Japan again, he added, “You must treat the
Japanese with kindness since, as Bahá’u’lláh has
stated, ‘A kind word captures a heart.’” After
speaking these holy words our beloved Guardian stood
up and left us.[62;196]

First visitation of the Shrine of the Báb
After our beloved Guardian’s departure we got
up, too, and started walking toward the Carmel
mountain. On the way to the mountain we were

praising God while we were all astonished. Now we,
his humble servants, are called here in this holy
place. It is obvious that, as everyone else, we all
desired to come to the presence of His apostle, but
the amazing thing was that His apostle was waiting
for us and wished to see us. It is for such
occasions that the Íránian poet said:
“There is nothing unusual

when a hunter follows a deer,
But it is quite different when our poor deer

comes to meet its hunter.”[63;196]
It is only the work of God and the wishes of our
Master that such miracles happen. After all these
spiritual inspirations which his presence had
inspired in us, we departed toward the Báb’s Shrine
with a guide, Miss Revell.[64;196]

We walked through beautiful gardens and nicely
decorated avenues until we arrived near the Shrine.
It was a sweet dream for us. We were in doubt
whether it was our own persons here before the Holy
Shrine. How beautiful are the flowers and what an
enchanting view we are facing now. The whole earth
was attractive with a sort of beauty and fascination

that we had not seen or touched before. A spiritual
breeze is blowing on us. Here is the promised
paradise of human beings, appeared to us in the form
of these enchanting gardens. This garden with its
beautiful flowers in it is the sacred residence of
our beloved Guardian and a single flower—or
everything in it—is a symbol of him and brings him
into our memories. Above all these is the golden
dome of the [Shrine of the] Báb, which according to
our beloved Guardian is “the white dress of
mankind’s bride decorated with a golden
crown.”[65;197]

We are now before the Shrine and the doors were
opened for us. Suddenly all the lamps were lighted
and the whole sacred place turned into a piece of
bright jewel. We all fell into worship and prayed
for the prosperity of mankind, our Japanese friends,
and for our close relations. A spiritual enchanting
breeze is blowing upon us as our heads are bowed on
the threshold of this holy place. We feel as if the
spirits of all God’s prophets are now pilgriming in
this holy place.
In our hearts, addressing His Holiness the Báb,

we repeated the words: “Our dear Báb! Our souls be
sacrificed to Thy sacred blood and to Thy oppressed
body. Thou [wast im]prisoned in Chihríq and Mákú
while Thou had none beside You. There was not even a
servant to light a lamp for Thou, and finally Thou
wert martyred in Ádharbáyján. But since Thou gave
light to the world and promised Your eternal and
future kingdom unto mankind, thousands [of] lamps
are now lighted in Your holy place lighting our
hearts.”

Although our beloved Guardian was not with us in
this pilgrimage [i.e., visitation] yet his first
meeting had such a spiritual effect on us, which is
as if he is always with us and we now feel his
presence.

The light in the middle of the continent

and the middle of the ocean
In the afternoon of 27th December our beloved
Guardian came toward the gardens of the Pilgrim
House and called us into his presence.[66;197] We
now had the privilege of walking with him. [He said
to us] “The Faith of God will make great progress in

Japan as Bahá’u’lláh has promised us. He said, ‘If
you cover the light in the middle of the earth it
will come out from the middle of oceans and seas and
it will speak unto you saying, “Behold, I am the
light and the savior of the world!”’”

Our beloved Guardian then explained what this
meant: “By the middle of the earth,” he said,
“Bahá’u’lláh meant Írán, which is in the middle of
Asia; by the middle of oceans and the seas He meant
Japan, which is an island among the ocean and seas.”
He then added that if they would try to hide the
Faith of God in Persia it will appear and come out
from Japan saying, “I am the true light and the
savior of mankind!”

“Still,” said our beloved Guardian, “they have
not been successful in eliminating the Faith of God
in Írán, and the same situation will continue for
some time.”[67;197]

Hiroshima
“The friends in Hiroshima are presenting to your
holiness their humble and sincere devotions,” I said
to our beloved Guardian. Our beloved Guardian

replied, “The people of Hiroshima have suffered
greatly during the recent war and they are therefore
prepared to accept the Faith easily. This is a new
center which was opened to the Faith of God after
Mr. Khádim’s visit to the Far East.”

I then spoke to our beloved Guardian of [the new
center], which was established by the Japanese
inhabitants of the city. “Of course,” said our
beloved Guardian, “such centers must be formed
through the efforts and determination of the
Japanese people, as in the case of Africa, where the
friends are so active and enthusiastic in their work
that they extended their activities and pioneered to
other countries.”[68;198]

Japan and Africa
“Japan,” he then told us, “will become a second
Africa one day.” Our Faith was introduced in this
country fifty years ago, but now it is the moment of
obtaining positive results from our activities.

> Establishment of a National Spiritual Assembly
> “The National Spiritual Assembly of Japan,” said
our beloved Guardian, “must be formed next year.
This year it is the turn of Africa. We will have
three National Spiritual Assemblies in Africa this
year: one in the heart of Africa, the second in the
west, and the third in the south.” Turning [back] to
the question of Japan, our beloved Guardian added,
“The surrounding islands will be ordered to send
delegates to Japan to participate in selecting
[i.e., electing] the members of the National
Spiritual Assembly.”[70;198]

“Then this Assembly can be called the National
Spiritual Assembly of Japan and the Far East
Islands,” I said.

But our beloved Guardian corrected my statement
by saying, “Not all the islands, as there are too
many of them in the Far East, but only Japan and the
surrounding islands.”[71;199]

A new believer in Kobe
I then informed our beloved Guardian that in
[the city of] Kobe a prominent educated personality—

a newspaperman in career—has been recently converted
into our Faith and has registered his name just
before our departure for the Holy Land.

“This is very important,” said our beloved
Guardian, after blessing the new believer (Mr.
[Rihei] Sako). “Editors, authors, and educated
people are important provided that when converted to
our Faith they leave aside all their political
activities and never interfere with such affairs
again. Politicians and political affairs must never
be an attraction to the friends, but on the contrary
their activities must be of such nature as to
convince these politicians of God’s great work, the
importance of their [the friends’] Motto, and the
nothingness of their [the politicians’] worldly
ambitions and activities before His wishes.”[72;199]

National Spiritual Assemblies in the Pacific region

“The National Spiritual Assembly of Japan,” said
our beloved Guardian, “is the foundation of the
North Pacific for our Administrative Order, and the
National Spiritual Assembly of New Zealand the
foundation of the South Pacific. Between these two,”

he added, “we will have two National Spiritual
Assemblies: one in Fugi [sic; meaning Fiji], [to]
the east of Australia; and the second in Indonesia,
east of Asia [i.e., South East Asia]. Therefore we
will have four National Spiritual Assemblies as
follows:
— one for Japan and the surrounding islands, to be
formed in Japan;
— one in [the] south to be formed in New Zealand;
— the third will be formed [to] the east of
Australia at the Fugi Island [Fiji];
— the fourth one is to be formed in the islands of
Indonesia.
And finally, there is the fifth N.S.A., in
Australia.”

Then he turned to the Íránian pilgrims and said,
“These five National Spiritual Assemblies will form
the foundations of our organization in the Pacific
Ocean.”[73;199]

A Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds in Tokyo,
and incorporation of the Tokyo Spiritual Assembly
[Continuing to address the Persian pilgrims] our

beloved Guardian said, “A Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds is now
established in Tokyo through Mr. Mumtází’s efforts
and devotions, and the Local Spiritual Assembly of
this city is already registered [i.e.,
incorporated]. The Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds has been
purchased and the Local Spiritual Assembly is
registered in Tokyo. Both of these works,” again
confirmed our beloved Guardian, “have been carried
out and are completed now. And these have come to us
through the efforts and devotions of Mr. Mumtází,
who is the distinguished servant of the Faith of
God.”

“These all,” I replied, “had been accomplished
through thy blessings and guidance, and through the
spiritual inspirations that thou had extended to
your humble servant.”

“You have come a long way, almost half of the
globe,” said our beloved Guardian, and he then
blessed me.[74;200]

Bahá’í endowments in Japan
“Thanks be to God,” said our beloved Guardian,
“that we now have two Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds in Japan, and

our endowments, too, must be included to
them.”[75;201]

“By the blessings of God,” I said, “the land for
an endowment is already prepared.”

“I know it,” replied our beloved Guardian, “and
thanks be to God that the privilege of contributing
land for this purpose has been yours, too. These are
important matters,” said our beloved Guardian, “and
they will be recorded in history—both the
contributed land and the names of the
contributors.”[76;201]

Our beloved Guardian knows everything
“Now the Bahá’ís of Japan,” said our beloved
Guardian, “must think of electing their National
Spiritual Assembly. Hitherto they elected the Local
Spiritual Assembly; now they must make preparations
for their National Spiritual Assembly.”

“We have two Local Spiritual Assemblies in
Japan,” [continued] our beloved Guardian, “one in
Tokyo and the other in . . . ” He waited a few
moments to name the second place, while I said,
“. . . Hyogo ken.” I then explained to our beloved

Guardian that in Japan the collection of several
cities in one place is called “ken”. I wanted to
give further explanation to our beloved Guardian
about the type of organizations in Japan, and
starting with “ken” I was going to explain the rest
but before being able to continue our beloved
Guardian said, “After ‘ken’ comes ‘fu’; after ‘fu’
is ‘to’; and Tokyo is ‘to’—is it not so?”

I bowed, and it was at this moment I realized
that our beloved Guardian knows everything.[77;201]

Obedience to the Administrative Order
I said to our beloved Guardian: “Previously and
when our beloved Guardian had informed us that in
1957 [the election of] the Japanese National
Spiritual Assembly will take place we were all
amazed and wondering how this is to happen. We had
no Local Spiritual Assemblies in Japan, the
believers of the Cause of God were so few, and many
requirements were to be met. But now that through
God’s grace and our beloved Guardian’s blessings and
assistance this is going to take place we are all
certain that this has become a possibility from a

dream through the blessings of God and under the
spiritual guidance and the blessings of our beloved
Guardian. It is obvious that the Cause of God has
worked its way in this matter.”

Our beloved Guardian then turned his face toward
me and said, “Do you know why and how all this has
come into reality? It is because of the obedience to
the Administrative Order that all this have been
performed,” he then replied to his own question.

By the Administrative Order our beloved Guardian
meant that one must be faithful to the Covenant, as
it is the wish and desire of our Master, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá.

Unity of the Bahá’ís of Japan
“Are all the Bahá’ís of Japan united and
faithful to the Cause of God?” our beloved Guardian
asked me then.

[I replied] “Although they are of different
nationalities and races, such as Íránians,
Americans, and Japanese, and the unity of these
diverse types and races is difficult, thanks be to
God that all of them are united and faithful in our

Great Motto and the Cause of God.”

Our beloved Guardian was delighted at hearing
this and we could see happiness and delight in his
face and in his whole appearance.

Obedience to the N.S.A. of the United States
“The Japanese organizations are under the
supervision of the U.S.A. organizations and I have
entrusted Japan to the U.S.A., as I have entrusted
Turkey to Írán. The National Spiritual Assembly of
Japan must be organized by the U.S.A.’s
organizations,” confirmed our beloved Guardian.

Then our beloved Guardian asked if the Bahá’ís
of Japan are obeying the Bahá’ís of the U.S.A.
“Yes,” I replied. Our beloved Guardian confirmed
again that the U.S.A. organizations are supervising
and taking care of the Japanese organizations and
that this is the New World’s Order.

“The L.S.A. of Tokyo must be an intermediate
between the U.S.A. National Spiritual Assembly and
the Bahá’ís of Japan. It must take the required
information from the U.S.A. and give it to the
Bahá’ís of Japan. As now it is the beginning of

Japan’s organizations, all the measures and steps
which we take with regard to forming these
organizations must be profound,” said our beloved
Guardian. “The progress of the Cause of God depends
on having plans and means,” he added. “Plans are
very important in performing this great
work.”[78;201]

Progress of the Cause in Japan
“Thanks be to God,” said our beloved Guardian,
“that the Cause of God has made a great progress in
Japan.” Then he turned to the Íránian pilgrims and
added, “Mr. Mumtází is the distinguished servant of
the Cause of God.”

Turning to me he said, “You must assure the
Japanese people that their country will turn into a
second Africa one day. The fire started from the
U.S.A. but its flames are now appearing in Japan.
Like Írán, many Bahá’í centers will be formed in
Japan. When the National Spiritual Assembly of Japan
is formed, the Faith of God will make great progress
there.”

Election of the National Spiritual Assembly
[Speaking of the formation of the N.S.A. the
Guardian said] “There will be a Convention for
electing the members of the National Spiritual
Assembly.”

“Are the members of [i.e., delegates to] the
Convention to be elected by the Local Spiritual
Assemblies or by the believers of Japan?” I asked.

“The members of the National Spiritual
Assembly,” said our beloved Guardian, “will be
elected by the members of the Convention, and the
members of the Convention will be elected by Bahá’ís
in the centers which have already formed their Local
Spiritual Assemblies.”

“Are the members of the Convention to be elected
by the centers which have Local Spiritual
Assemblies, or other centers, with no Local
Spiritual Assemblies, can also participate in
electing these members?” I asked.

“Only the centers which have formed their Local
Spiritual Assemblies must take part in electing the
members of the Convention,” replied our beloved
Guardian. “This decision has been taken for the

purpose of encouraging all our centers to form their
Local Spiritual Assemblies as soon as
possible.”[79;202]

“How many Local Spiritual Assemblies must we
have in Japan to form the National Spiritual
Assembly?” I asked.

“The more you have the better,” replied our
beloved Guardian.

“It is the order,” I said, “that only the Local
Spiritual Assemblies which were formed in 1956 are
entitled to elect delegates for [the Convention to
elect] the National Spiritual Assembl[y] [in 1957].
In this case what are the duties of the Local
Spiritual Assemblies of [i.e., formed in] 1957?”

“These L.S.A.[s],” replied our beloved Guardian,
“must wait for a year and then they will elect the
delegates of [the Convention to elect] the National
Spiritual Assembly of 1958. The same applies in the
U.S.A.”

“We have very little time for setting up the
National Spiritual Assembly of 1957 and therefore we
are in great need for thou blessings and
assistance,” I said.

“The time is short,” said our beloved Guardian,
“but the blessings and assistance of God will come
in time.”

Incorporation of the National Spiritual Assembly

“First of all,” said our beloved Guardian,
“[you] must form the National Spiritual Assembly of
Japan, and then comes the question of registering
[i.e., incorporating] it in Japan, and finally comes
the question of registering the same in the Holy
Land.”

“The government of Japan has already registered
our Assembly,” I replied at this moment.

“That is the Local Spiritual Assembly which is
registered,” said our beloved Guardian. “When the
National Spiritual Assembly is formed you must try
to register it too.”

“This will become a problem for us,” I said, “as
the government of Japan, according to their laws and
regulations, must have one person responsible for
this Assembly and not a committee.”

Our beloved Guardian replied that the Assembly
must be registered in the name of a committee and

not a person. He then added that first of all we
must investigate about this matter, secondly we must
consult and ask the advice of specialists, and
finally to work hard for the solution of this
problem. “When you do all these,” he said, “you will
certainly succeed.”[80;202]

The “Bahá’í News” of Japan
“Are you receiving the Bahá’í news [i.e.,
worldwide news of the Faith] in Japan regularly and
in time?” asked our beloved Guardian.

> “Yes, our beloved Guardian,” I replied.
> “Through which channels?” he again asked.

“Through the U.S.A. regularly, and sometimes
from Írán,” I replied. Our beloved Guardian then
gave instructions so that we may translate the main
parts of our news and circulate them.

“We have a bulletin,” I said, “which is called
the ‘Bahá’í News’, and this is printed in the
Japanese language in Tokyo.”

“Although this is published in the Japanese
language,” said our beloved Guardian, “you should
send a copy of it regularly to the Holy Land.”

“Praise be to thy knowledge and wisdom,” I said
to myself [addressing the Guardian], “thou surely
knowest Japanese too.”

Translation of Bahá’í literature
Our beloved Guardian then pointed out that the
Bahá’í literature has been translated into most
languages while up to now very little of it has been
translated into the Japanese language.

“The translation of this literature,” I replied,
“is very difficult, but still our translators are
working on it with keen interest.”

“You must be very careful,” said our beloved
Guardian, “so that these translations are accurate
and correct. These translations must be very
accurate and precise, expressing all the expressions
and the beauties of our literature. They must be
translated in such a way as to leave the real
meaning—the spirit of the original text—untouched
[i.e., unchanged].” He then asked us to send a copy
of everything we translate there to the Holy Land.
“I will keep these works,” said our beloved
Guardian, “since I have books from 180 languages in

the International Archive of the Holy Land.”

Yokohama and Kyoto
“Yokohama and Kyoto,” said our beloved Guardian,
“are two important cities in Japan and you must pay
them special attention.”

Youth and women
“The Japanese youth and women must be encouraged
to be brave in serving the Cause of God,” said our
beloved Guardian while he was turning his face to
me. “Have you many young people in Tokyo?”

Our beloved Guardian was told that we have not
many young people in Tokyo.

“Special and private committees must be
organized for young people and women,” added then
our beloved Guardian. “The privilege of our Faith is
that women will progress and improve far above men
in the East.”

“How are the Bahá’í women of Japan?” he then
asked me.

“All of them are active and faithful to the
Cause of God,” I replied, “especially the young

girls who are newly converted. They take an active
part in our organizations and have become members of
the Local Spiritual Assembly.”

“You must encourage them very much,” said then
our beloved Guardian.

I pointed out that the Japanese women are mostly
educated. “I know it,” said our beloved Guardian.

“They are very polite, hard-working, and patient
when being oppressed,” I then added.

“Still they are Oriental,” said our beloved
Guardian, “and more or less under the influence of
man, but [the Bahá’ís] must encourage them, make
them brave, and change their conditions.”[81;202]
Again our beloved Guardian added that the Bahá’í
young people and women must be very clean and
virtuous, especially in Írán.

Our beloved Guardian then pointed out that the
moral of society is very low in U.S.A. “Is it the
same in Japan?” he asked.

> “Yes, it is the same in Japan,” I replied.

People have released themselves from fanaticism
in the twentieth century, but on the other hand they
have turned to materialism and become materialistic.

They escaped one disaster, but are now involved in
another one.[82;202]

A symbol of the Japanese Bahá’ís’ love

in the Mansion of Bahjí
We then presented a symbol of the Japanese
Bahá’ís’ love to our beloved Guardian: an
embroidered piece of cloth of Fuji mountain, at the
bottom of which the following words were
embroidered: “This piece is a symbol of our most
exalted love to thou, Oh our beloved Guardian.”

We thought of the extraordinary work and the
many occupations and important matters which our
beloved Guardian has and the correspondence which he
must carry out with 242 countries [sic; see the next
section], and were of the opinion that he will come
to our present after a period of at least one or two
months. But a wonderful thing happened the next day
when we were visiting the Mansion of Bahjí: the
servant of the Mansion told us the good news that
our present was accepted and that our beloved
Guardian had ordered him to hang it in a visible
place in his own private room in the Mansion,

together with a picture of Nikko’s Conference, which
was to be hanged somewhere in his sitting place.

All I was wishing now was that all our Bahá’í
friends of Japan could be here to see us present in
this holy place. I started crying and was going
almost to faint when I heard the servant of the
Mansion speaking to us, saying that we have all
received the special blessings of our beloved
Guardian and that despite all the occupations and
the troubles that our beloved Guardian has to bear
for mankind he has noticed us so early and has given
us his special blessings.

Progress of the Cause throughout the world
In our second visit on the 27th of December our
beloved Guardian spoke of the progress of the Cause
of God all over the world, saying, “The Faith of God
has made a great progress in the world: 160
Assemblies, some of which are National Spiritual
Assemblies and others Local Spiritual Assemblies,
are registered, and you will see their respective
documents in the Bahjí Mansion. Our literature is

translated into 190 languages. Our centers have
reached the figure of 3,700 throughout the world, of
which 1,500 are in the U.S.A.; then comes Írán,
which has between 700 to 800 centers—but the friends
in this country must try to bring the figure to
1,000. Also, we have now more than 400 centers in
Africa, 100 in Canada, and another 100 in England.

“Now the number of countries where the Faith of
God has reached is 242. In the Ten-Year Crusade it
was originally planned that another 131 countries
should be opened to the Faith of God, while, to our
delight, up to now and before three years, 111 of
them are already opened.” Then said our beloved
Guardian, “You must communicate these glad-tidings
to the friends in Japan.”[85;202]

“Two countries which are newly opened to the
Faith of God and which were not mentioned in our
Ten-Year Plan are Trinidad and Saigon. Another
country not originally named in the Plan is Tibet,
which is beyond the Iron Curtain and the center of
Buddhism,” said our beloved Guardian.

Pioneers in the northernmost parts

of the American continent
“Our pioneers have reached to the 73rd latitude
above the equator,” said our beloved Guardian. “This
is the north[ernmost point in the] Bahá’í world. The
highest inhabited point above the equator is 68
[degrees], but the friends have reached to 73. In
Europe they have reached to the 70th latitude.

Our beloved Guardian added, “Bahá’u’lláh, in the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas, has spoken to us about these islands.
In that Book He has ordered us to pray the
Obligatory Prayer in regular intervals in the places
and cities where they have long nights and long
days. This saying is for such islands, since in the
middle of winter there is no sun in them, and in the
middle of summer the sun never disappears.”[86;203]

Races introduced to the Faith
“The various races converted [i.e., introduced]
to the Faith are above 40 now. The white race comes
first and has the majority but later the Negro race
will take over this majority, as the number of
believers of the black race has exceeded the figure

of 2,300 within a period of less than three years.
After the black comes the red race, or the natives
of America, of whom only a few have been converted
up to now.”[87;203]

Islands opened to the Faith
“The converted [i.e., opened] islands are over
95, of which 30 were converted before the Ten-Year
Crusade. Another 65 islands [have been] converted
during the period of the Crusade. During 100 years
only 30 islands were converted to the Cause, while
65 islands are converted and opened to the Faith
during three years.” A sort of spiritual happiness
appeared in our beloved Guardian’s face when
communicating these good news to us. Our delight was
beyond description and we wanted all our Bahá’í
friends from all over the world to hear his words
and to share our delight and happiness.

“There is so much good news arriving from all
over the world,” said our beloved Guardian, “that I
have not time to write it. I am therefore
communicating it to the pilgrims who are visiting
the Holy Land so that in their turn they may

communicate the same to the friends all over the
world.”

Purchases of National Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds

around the world
“In the Ten-Year Crusade we had planned to
purchase 50 National Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds, while up to
this moment—thanks be to God—32 National Ḥaẓíratu’l-
Quds are purchased and during less than three years,
including the Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds of Tokyo.”[88;203]

The Bahá’í New Order
Then our beloved Guardian said, “The Báb in His
Holy Book has spoken to us about the Bahá’í New
Order. In His prison at Mákú—at the time of distress
and depression—He said: ‘Happy be those who can see
the New Order of Bahá’u’lláh.’ Bahá’u’lláh, in His
turn, has spoken to us about this New Order and
said, ‘The order of the old world has been abolished
and replaced by this New Order.’ Bahá’u’lláh has
spoken of two orders: the first is the old order,
which will be abolished; the second is the New
Order, which will replace this abolished

order.”[89;203]

[The Guardian continued:] “In His Will and
Testament ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has spoken to us about how
this New Order is to be performed. It is through
organizing Local Spiritual Assemblies and National
Spiritual Assemblies and the International House of
Justice that the New Order will be put into work all
over the world. The foundation of this New Order,
which is the establishment of Local Spiritual
Assemblies, is already performed; the pillar[s] of
the construction, namely the National Spiritual
Assemblies, are ready. And therefore only the roof,
which is the International House of Justice, is left
to be constructed. The members of the International
House of Justice must be elected by the National
Spiritual Assemblies.”[90;204]

“Now it is the beginning of this New Order,” our
beloved Guardian then added. “The Báb has spoken to
us about this in advance, Bahá’u’lláh has ruled this
New Order, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has explained to us how
this will be performed, in His Will and Testament.
Now it is the time to perform it. This is the great
happy tiding.”

Purchase of land for the Mashriqu’l-Adhkár
Our beloved Guardian said, “100,000 meters [sic]
of land has been purchased at the top of Mount
Carmel and a Mashriqu’l-Adhkár will be built there
soon. In the Ten-Year Crusade we were supposed to
purchase eleven pieces of land in eleven countries
for this purpose, while up to this time ten pieces
of land are purchased and only one is left.”[91;204]

Two Plans for the progress of the Cause
“We have two Plans to improve the Faith of God
in the world,” said our beloved Guardian. “One of
these Plans is our Ten-Year Crusade, which is to be
performed by National Spiritual Assemblies and Local
Spiritual Assemblies and by our committees and the
friends all over the world. This, however, is our
minor project. The second Plan, which is our major
Plan, is the Plan of our Lord—the unseen hand of God
—which at His order works out through the recent
revolutions all over the world.”[92;204]

Walking with our beloved Guardian
Up to now we had always been presented to our

beloved Guardian while he was walking in the garden.
He was speaking to us while making these walks and
we knew in our hearts that all the kings of the
world were envying us, as we were at the presence of
our spiritual king and had his blessings.

Visitation of the Shrine of the Báb
in the presence of our beloved Guardian
While speaking with us our beloved Guardian was
proceeding toward the Holy Shrine of the Báb and we
were following him. At intervals he would worship
the place and when entering the Shrine he worshipped
and kissed the threshold. Following him we kissed
the places which he had kissed and by this, as the
Íránian poet says, we were performing two
performances by a single act, both of which had
given us a great delight and happiness.

I wish all the friends from all over the world
could be here to hear our beloved Guardian’s voice
while he was reading [i.e., chanting] with his own
sacred voice the Tablet of Visitation. We fell into
a sort of unconsciousness and we were almost going
to faint when his heavenly melody was heard. Our

souls were flying in the skies and his holy voice
had taken us into heaven and in the dwelling place
of the angels. We are sure that whatever we had
asked from our Lord, God, then and there it will be
granted unto us, since we had all these blessings
and were received with kindness, affection, and
mercy by our beloved Guardian.

His affection
While entering his car the corner of our beloved
Guardian’s eyes would turn unto us and it was then
and there and by observing such affection from him
that our souls and bodies would not have the
capacity to swallow all this affection and his
words. Then the door of his car would open and he
would leave us: at those moments we would fall into
a state of unconsciousness—a state which is
spiritual and cannot be explained by words. This
state was the effect of his holy words and his
spiritual power on us. Here with our own eyes we
were observing the riding of the king of kings. He
would lift up his hands and would look with
affection to his devoted servants through the corner

of his eyes. We wanted to have a hundred lives at
those moments and sacrifice them all for him and
before him.

He knows all that is in our hearts
One day when I was at our beloved Guardian’s
presence I thought of telling him about my visit to
the Holy Land and our Master, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, which
took place 35 years ago, in 1920. “You have been
here and visited our Master 35 years ago,” said our
beloved Guardian, before I could say a word.

The beauty of Mount Carmel,
and the buildings to be constructed there
During the period of our stay in the Holy Land,
one day our beloved Guardian turned toward the
Shrine of the Báb and said, “This is a beautiful,
dignified, and outstanding Shrine. It is all light,
there are steps of light in this mountain, and in
the future it will be turned into a mountain of
lights.” While speaking these words to us his chair
was placed in a high place and we were ordered to
sit in his presence. Here was the master of the

world, shining like the sun and speaking to us,
telling us of the past and the future of the world.
The future of the world, the events which will take
place for the Cause of God, were spoken to us in
such a dignified way and with such a spiritual power
and authority that it was as if we could almost see
them with our own eyes.

“We will have two centers in this mountain,”
said our beloved Guardian. “One is the spiritual
center and the second our center for the
Administrative Order. The spiritual center is the
Shrine of the Báb, but we will construct here the
following buildings for maintaining and organizing
the Administrative Order:
— a building for the International Archives, whose
construction has already started;
— a building for the International House of Justice,
where the unwritten orders of our Holy Book, the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas, will be composed and ruled for the
people of the world;
— a building for the Guardians of the Cause of God,
where they will explain the written but unknown
orders of the Holy Book, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas;

— also a building is to be allocated to science-
industry [i.e., technology or applied science?] and
scientific researches;
— and finally, there will be constructed a building
for teaching the Cause of God; the Hands of the
Cause will meet in this building.”

“Is the building for teaching the Cause a
spiritual building or an administrative one?” I
asked.

“It is an administrative building,” replied our
beloved Guardian.

“Is the Shrine of the Báb our spiritual center
only?” I asked then.

“Only the Shrine of the Báb in Mount Carmel and
the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh in ‘Akká are spiritual
centers,” confirmed our beloved Guardian.[93;204]

The extent of the Bahá’í Revelation
“The orders of our Holy Book,” said our beloved
Guardian, “are only for 1,000 years, and it is
possible that after 1,000 years we might have new
orders and new advents, but for 500,000 years no
Prophet Who could be compared with Bahá’u’lláh will

appear in the world. We will witness the coming of
Prophets during this period but all of them will be
under the guidance of Bahá’u’lláh.”[94;205]

Registration of branches of
> National Spiritual Assemblies in the Holy Land
> “Now we have ten National Spiritual Assemblies
in the world but in the Ten-Year Crusade we have
planned to have another 50, and this will bring the
total figure to 60,” said our beloved Guardian. “In
the future all the [Bahá’í] properties and lands of
the Holy Land will be registered in the name of
these 60 National Spiritual Assemblies. Through this
registration we will unite the National Spiritual
Assemblies of the world together. The National
Spiritual Assembly of Japan is one of these centers
and we will register a piece of land here in its
name. We have already registered [a branch of the]
U.S.A.’s N.S.A. here. Later the Assemblies of
England, Canada, India, Australia, and finally Írán
were registered here.”

Pilgrimage to the holy city of ‘Akká
At the order of our beloved Guardian, we left
for the holy city of ‘Akká together with a group of
Bahá’í pilgrims from the U.S.A. and Írán. On
entering the city the first thing we did was to
visit the great prison of Bahá’u’lláh—“Qishlih”. We
were walking in the same dark, narrow streets where
our beloved, oppressed Apostle, Bahá’u’lláh, had
walked guarded by the soldiers of the ‘Uthmán
Empire. The thick walls of that historic prison
could be seen now from the distant. We are now
closer and have entered it through the front door.

While we were entering His prison old memories
came back into our minds; we remembered the period
when people were forbidden to approach and enter the
place. We could see shadows of those soldiers
accompanying Bahá’u’lláh and forbidding people to
approach Him, and then we could see among them
Jarráh Effendí, who became converted and who prayed
that he be given the privilege of serving the Cause
of God. Now his grandchildren are blessed and
honored by being privileged to serve the Cause of

God as gardeners of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh.

We entered the prison with a confused and
disordered mind. The humble and sad atmosphere of
this prison are signs and symbols of the oppression
which Bahá’u’lláh had endured. After going up
through narrow and irregular steps, we entered the
special room where Bahá’u’lláh was imprisoned. This
dark and small room is still covered with a rough
mat, as a souvenir to those days.

The ‘Uthmán Empire was in vain using this prison
with thick walls as a means to prevent the world
from being informed of His appearance and advent. No
one knows whether there was ever a lamp in this
prison where our Beloved One was [im]prisoned for
years, but every observer is sure of one thing, and
that is, the sun has never touched His prison.

But it was in this dark room that Bahá’u’lláh
made preparations for the salvation of the world,
and He established here and in this dark and sad
room the foundations of an international and world
peace. We sat there for some minutes and, reminded

of the oppressions which He had endured, said a
prayer. We worshipped the place and kissed the
ground, and then we left the prison and went to the
House of ‘Abbúd.

The House of ‘Abbúd
Although Bahá’u’lláh was a little comfortable
here with his family, but still the House of ‘Abbúd
was humble, small, and unsuitable for Him. Our
Beloved One lived here with His Family for seven
years. We saw His bed, hat, and several other items
of His household belongings and furniture there. We
then went to the room where the Holy Book—the Kitáb-
i-Aqdas—had descended. It was in this room that the
foundation of the New Order of the world was
established and the old order was destroyed and
abolished. After worshipping the place and kissing
its holy threshold we left the House.

The Garden of Riḍván
“I have not seen green grass for over nine
years,” said Bahá’u’lláh. When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá heard
this He went and prepared the Garden of Riḍván,

where Bahá’u’lláh was walking in it sometimes. Now
we had the privilege to walk in this Garden. We sat
[by] the brook where Bahá’u’lláh used to sit in
those times, and we were feeling a sort of delight
at this simple and yet noticeable privilege. A chair
and a bed were left there from Bahá’u’lláh’s
personal belongings. We kissed them. There was also
a written tablet from Bahá’u’lláh there. We read it
and, while reading it, it was as if Bahá’u’lláh was
present there and was watching us. After visiting
this Garden we left it to go to the Garden of
Firdaws.[98;206]

The Garden of Firdaws
The Garden of Firdaws has a pool where
Bahá’u’lláh would sit in front of it sometimes. We
visited this Garden, too, and enjoyed its beauties.

The Mansion of Mazra‘ih
We then entered the Mazra‘ih Mansion and visited
some of the personal belongings of Bahá’u’lláh. It
was after this visit that we realized that He was
not very comfortable here, [where] He dwelt after

His release from prison. We saw beautiful sights in
this Mansion.

The Mansion of Bahjí
This Mansion is a symbol of His Kingdom. Now
there are beautiful gardens and wide avenues with
the shadow of big trees, all of which have come into
existence through the special attention which our
beloved Guardian is paying to the residence of His
Holiness. The beautiful flowers and the
extraordinary handsome statues took our breath away
from us. The wide avenues shadowed with its big
trees are something a visitor can never forget. The
Mansion is lighted with strong projectors in the
evenings. We visited it in the evening when all its
gardens were full of light.

We then visited the rooms of the Mansion one by
one. In the hall were the certificates of the
registration which the governments of the world had
issued in recognition to the Faith. There was a
written document from every country, and pictures of
Bahá’u’lláh’s Family were decorating the hall.
We visited all the rooms until we entered the

private room of Bahá’u’lláh. This is the same room
where the British professor and historian Browne was
presented to Bahá’u’lláh—and who said, when visiting
His Holiness, “I could obviously see that kings of
countries were envying me as I was visiting the King
of kings, and One Whose Kingdom is eternal.”[99;206]
The bed of Bahá’u’lláh was still in this room and
His slippers were laid down near it. All the rooms
were lighted with electricity except this room,
which had still a petrol lamp in it as a matter of
tradition and remembrance of those old historic
days. We were all confused and our minds could not
work any longer. Are we—the humble servants of our
Master—here present in this historical place?

Visitation of the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh
Intending to enter the Shrine we first made a
tour around it humbly until we came to a street
which was leading us to the door of the Shrine. From
far away we could see the Sign set on the top of the
entrance. “My God! What an extreme happiness Thou
hast given to us” we said while crossing these
streets. Beautiful statues and big bowls of flowers

are located on both sides of the streets. They are
wide and beautiful and it appeared to us that
somehow our beloved Guardian had provided them for
the future kings who will come to pay homage and
pilgrimage to this Holy Shrine and who will walk
through these streets.[100;206]

We were approaching toward the Shrine humbly.

All the way we were praying humbly until we reached
the door of the Shrine. We took off our shoes and
the door was opened unto us. All the Shrine was
lighted and full of flowers, and the whole place was
smelling with a sort of fine spiritual scent which I
am unable to explain it in words. This scent and the
holy atmosphere of the Shrine took our souls to
heaven right in the presence of Bahá’u’lláh.
Automatically our heads bowed and we kissed this
sacred place, which had been kissed so many times by
our beloved ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and our beloved Guardian.

We were wandering in heaven—soul and body—now. I
wish all our Bahá’í friends could be here to see
what a privilege we have had at this moment. We
prayed for all the people of the world, asking God
to grant them the same privilege and blessings.

Night’s stay in the Mansion of Bahjí
Every pilgrim was allowed through the kindness
of our beloved Guardian to sleep one night in the
Bahjí Mansion. But here a special blessing came to
us from our beloved Guardian. It was Dr. Luṭfu’lláh
Ḥakím who gave us this good news, that our beloved
Guardian has given orders that I might be allowed to
spend the evening alone in the reception room of
Bahá’u’lláh. My wife, too, was allowed to spend the
evening at the special room which our beloved
Guardian had in the Mansion. This good piece of news
had a great and surprising effect on me and my wife
and we were almost going to faint from the extreme
pleasure which this good piece of news had brought
to us. We were both crying like children when we had
to leave our companion pilgrims to go to our rooms.

I can find no words to explain the blessings and
privilege which we have had in those two rooms. It
was something beyond explanation and a whole book
will not suffice to express and explain those
merciful and kind blessings and the privilege which
had come to us during that night. We could see all
the Prophets of God in the presence of Bahá’u’lláh.

It was for such occasions that the Íránian poet
said:
“Like Moses all the Prophets of God are here

standing before Thee,
> And all of them are impatient to see Thee.
> I am also among them, among Thy lovers,
But if Thou would refuse to show Thyself to me,

I won’t leave Thee;
> I will stay and stay until I see Thee.”[101;206]
> We were praying and worshipping God all that
night, and this was the only night which will be
remembered throughout all our lives. From the
special blessings extended to us during that night
we hope that we may all succeed in our pioneering
service all over the world.

Effect of the ‘Akká visit
“Have you visited all the places?” asked our
beloved Guardian, after returning to him. “Have you
enjoyed this visit?” he repeated. “Have you kissed
all the holy thresholds?”

“Yes,” I replied, “but in all these holy places
we first saw thee, and then we kissed these holy

places.”

“All your thoughts must be toward the Shrine
only,” replied our beloved Guardian at this. “Have
you prayed for all your Japanese friends?” he then
asked us.

> “Yes, our beloved Guardian,” I replied.

“Were you very glad at seeing all these holy
places?” he then asked.

“We do not deserve all [this] kindness and
affection. We have not done anything to deserve all
thy blessings,” I replied.

“This is the reward of your sincere and faithful
service in the Far East, in Tokyo and in other
Japanese cities, and also the reward of your service
in other countries,” replied our beloved Guardian. I
was standing humbly before him and felt a sort of
shyness at hearing all this from our beloved
Guardian.

“Your services are very important,” said our
beloved Guardian, “since the organizations [i.e.,
Bahá’í institutions] of Japan must help us in the
matter of establishing the International House of
Justice.”

Our farewell
The time of farewell had come. The period of our
stay in the dreamed paradise had come to an end. Our
beloved Guardian called us alone to his presence to
bid us farewell. On entering the room I threw myself
at his feet, embraced them, and started kissing his
feet.

“God forbid it,” was saying our beloved
Guardian. “Do stand to bid farewell to me.” His
behavior was similar to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s treatment of
the pilgrims.[102;206]

When I stood up I saw my wife, too, had entered
the room. And since she intended to throw herself
unto his feet, our beloved Guardian opened his hands
and kept them before her so that she might not be
able to throw herself at his feet. But my wife, who
was on her knees now, was crying and asking him to
be allowed to kiss his feet. The more he was
preventing her, the more she would cry and beg him.
I was witnessing an astonishing sight. It was the
scene of an ant asking to throw itself at Solomon’s
feet. Our beloved Guardian was saying, “This is
prohibited,” but my wife was saying, “My life be

sacrificed for thee—allow me to kiss thy feet, to
throw myself under thy feet only once.” The argument
was going on for several minutes and at the end my
wife’s devotions and her sincere prayers touched his
ocean of mercy and he removed his hands, and my wife
threw herself on his feet.

After kissing his feet my wife and I were
ordered to sit and, while we were both crying from
joy and happiness, our beloved Guardian said,
“Thanks be to God that you have succeeded and have
come and visited the Holy Land and enjoyed the
spiritual breeze of the Shrine[s]. I was very eager
to see you. I had always blessed your sincere
service, and praise be to God that you have
succeeded and are both the organizer of the Faith of
God and its teacher in Japan. Be sure of the future
and give confidence to everyone that the future of
Japan is bright.”

“We have nothing, we are weak and need thy
guidance and blessings,” we said while we were both
weeping.

“Be sure that the blessings of Bahá’u’lláh are
with you,” said our beloved Guardian. “Now it is the

beginning of the organization of Japan, and you have
succeeded in such a difficult time. Japan will make
great progress, especially now that the National
Spiritual Assembly is to be formed there. This
Assembly is one of the foundations of the
International House of Justice. The Faith of God
will be extended from Japan to all the surrounding
islands and it will then be extended to Russia.”

“All the population of Japan—90 million people—
are anxious and in need of thy blessings and
guidance,” I said to our beloved Guardian.

“Give assurance to all of them,” said our
beloved Guardian, “that I will pray for you and for
the population of Japan, especially when I go to the
Shrine of the Báb.”

“The pioneering of the believers to Japan is
very important,” then added our beloved Guardian.
“On your way to Japan—in Írán, India—encourage the
friends to pioneer to Japan, and especially you must
encourage the friends in Írán and give them the good
news of the Holy Land. Give my love and blessings to
our old and new Japanese friends, and especially
to Miss [Agnes] Alexander and Mr. Robert

Imagire.”[103;206]

Then our beloved Guardian stood up with the
purpose to leave us. He came near and kissed me and
while leaving us his voice was repeatedly heard to
assure us of his blessings, until he disappeared. We
did not hear his holy voice, neither saw his holy
face again. But his bright and holy face was
engraved in our hearts, and we hope to keep this
spiritual blessing and wealth throughout all our
lives.

AFTERWORD

A tapestry from the resting place of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the Shrine of the
Báb was presented by the Guardian through Núru’d-Dín Mumtází to the
Spiritual Assembly of Tokyo. The Assembly permitted the precious
tapestry to be displayed in the Amagasaki Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds—which was
the first in Japan and whose building and property had been donated by
Mr. Mumtází—for some years, after which it was sent to Tokyo.

The tapestry has since been on display in the National Bahá’í Center
in Tokyo together with a brocade which, according to a letter written on
behalf of Shoghi Effendi, “rested immediately over the remains of
Bahá’u’lláh in His glorious Shrine.” This precious brocade was a gift from
the Guardian to the Bahá’ís of Japan and was presented in February
1954 in Haifa to Hiroyasu Takano, who was the only Japanese Bahá’í
other than Saichiro Fujita to meet the Guardian. Mr. Takano later served
as the chairman of the National Spiritual Assembly of Japan.

During the pilgrimage of Mr. and Mrs. Mumtází a letter referring to
them and to Mr. Fujita, who had accompanied them from Japan to Haifa,
was written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to the Hyogo Prefecture Spiritual
Assembly, of which the Mumtázís were members. The letter can be found
in Japan Will Turn Ablaze! (p. 99 rev. ed.) and follows:

[dated January 2, 1956]
It is indeed a great privilege for the Bahá’ís of Japan,

so remote from the Holy Land, to have two of their most
devoted teachers come to Haifa on pilgrimage; and he [the
Guardian] feels sure that they will carry back to the work in
that important Center in the Pacific area a fresh impetus
and a new inspiration.

It is also a source of great satisfaction to him that dear
Fujita has returned to serve here. It brings the Japanese
believers even closer to the International Center to have a
representative of their nation working for the Cause at its
World Center.

He assures you all that he will pray for the success,
not only of the work in Hyogo-ken, but throughout Japan,
and urges you and your co-workers to persevere in the
face of every obstacle.
[signed by Leroy Ioas]

[in the Guardian’s handwriting:]

May the Almighty remove all obstacles from your path,
enable you to lend a great impetus to the onward march of
His Faith, and contribute to the consolidation of His
institutions.
Your true brother, Shoghi

NOTES

1; 19. Dr. Yúnis K͟hán Afrúk͟htih served as secretary, translator, and
physician to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

The affirmation “He is God” (Arabic huwa alláh) appears in several
places in the Qur’án, is found very often in the Bahá’í and Bábí Writings
(e.g., the “Remover of difficulties” prayer), and is the subject of theological
discourses by both Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. It appears as an
asseveration at the beginning of a number of tablets revealed by the
Central Figures and likewise sometimes in the works of Middle Eastern
writers, as here. For the special significance of this expression in the
Bahá’í Revelation see Adib Taherzadeh, The Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh, pp.
160-161, or The Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, Vol. II, pp. 286-290.

2; 20. Mr. Mumtází and his brother had different surnames. Although he
writes that he was asked to help his brother in Europe, he also transacted
some business of his own while there, as will be apparent later in this
account.

The ‘abá was an outer robe functioning as a coat. “Ná’íní” means of
the city of Ná’ín, famed for its garments and rugs. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá regularly
received robes as gifts, which He graciously accepted and, aside from a
few of the simpler ones, generously gave away. Dr. Yúnis K   ͟hán
Afrúk͟htih’s above-mentioned book contains an extended reference to
such an episode.

3; 22. Going by what he says later in his account, this was not the first
time Mr. Mumtází left Írán and thus, presumably, not the first time he
applied for a passport.

Bandar-i-Pahlaví is known today as Bandar-i-Anzalí and is on the
Caspian Sea. Bádkúbih is present-day Baku, Azerbaijan.

4; 22. Siyyid Jalál Síná, eminent teacher of the Faith, was the son of the
Bahá’í poet Síná (Siyyid Isma‘íl Síná Sidihí Iṣfahání). Probably the latter
two persons mentioned were among the substantial number of Bahá’ís
who moved in the late 1800s and early 1900s from Írán to the Caucasus

and Central Asia and established thriving communities there.

The “uf” in the names is the Slavic surname ending -ov. The
Caucasus and Central Asia were ruled by the Soviet Union and earlier by
the Russian Empire, and many residents Russianized their surnames.
Although the communists who took power following the demise of the
Romanov dynasty formally forswore the policy of Russification that had
been implemented by Czar Alexander III, in actuality something similar
proceeded apace—having been duly modified to conform with Soviet
political and social theory—as Sovietization. One feature of the latter was
an ideological and practical intolerance of religion. Oppression of the
Bahá’ís began systematically in the late 1920s, culminating in
imprisonment, expulsion, or execution, along with the expropriation of the
first House of Worship, in Is͟hqábád in what is now Turkmenistan, but at
the time that Mr. Mumtází was passing through those regions the Bahá’ís
were as yet mainly unafflicted. On the situation of the Bahá’ís see
Graham Hassall’s paper at www.bahai-library.com/
hassall_babi_bahai_russia.

5; 23. Tiflís is present-day Tbilisi, Georgia. Báṭúm is present-day Batumi,
Georgia, on the Black Sea.

6; 25. Probably the persons mentioned were from Hamadán.

7; 25. Although the name of the city is given as “Istanbul” here, in the
original Mr. Mumtází uses “Islámbul”, which was one of several names by
which the city was known during the centuries of Ottoman rule.

8; 25. Mírzá Ḥusayn Tútí later lived in China and the Philippines and
visited Japan.

9; 26. The cathedral of Hagia Sophia was captured at the fall of
Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire, to Ottoman forces in
1453; Constantine XI died defending his city.

10; 27. Messina is on the northeast tip of Sicily, across a narrow strait (of
“Scylla and Charybdis” fame) from the Italian mainland. The earthquake

(and tsunami) occurred in 1908.

12; 29. The kuláh was a brimless Persian hat.

Loulie Albee Mathews was a pioneer in Paris for several years,
during part of which time she was a volunteer caregiver to casualties of
the First World War. An anecdote, found in Loulie Mathews’ obituary in
The Bahá’í World Vol. XIV plus online sources: Ms. Mathews hosted many
meetings in quite luxurious circumstances at her Paris hotel suite. Many
Persian Bahá’ís passed through Paris and attended those meetings,
including one man simply dressed and with deeply scared wrists, who
introduced himself saying he had come from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. When Ms.
Mathews inquired of the injuries the man explained that he had been
tortured for his Faith but that those moments had been of pure joy. This
encounter precipitated an existential crisis in Loulie Mathews as to the
depth of her knowledge of and commitment to the Cause of God, and she
wrote to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá saying she felt that she should return home to the
U.S., that she did not know enough about the Faith or herself to teach in a
place like Paris. Before she could mail the letter she received a tablet
from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that read in part, “Do thou go home and be humble and
obedient and by-and-by thou shalt become ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s lion and roar
across the Seven Seas.” Later she traveled extensively internationally to
teach the Faith, particularly in Latin America, and established a school in
Pine Valley, Colorado, U.S.A. to train Bahá’í teachers for international
service.

13; 32. In her book Arches of the Years Marzieh Gail, whose family lived
in Paris at the time, gives glimpses of Shoghi Effendi’s sojourn in the city,
including a large gathering at the residence of Loulie Mathews at which
he spoke. She records July 5 as its date—too late to be the meeting Mr.
Mumtází attended. Previous to the Paris stay Shoghi Effendi served as
secretary to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, assisting Him in various ways in addition to
translating correspondence. In the latter half of July he moved from Paris
to England, where he matriculated at the University of Oxford.
Dr. Luṭfu’lláh Ḥakím, who translated Shoghi Effendi’s remarks at the

meeting Mr. Mumtází attended, served ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Haifa,
accompanied Shoghi Effendi to France and England, and many years
later was a member of the appointive and elective International Bahá’í
Councils and then of the first Universal House of Justice.

14; 35. Ḥájí Ak͟húnd was an Apostle of Bahá’u’lláh and a Hand of the
Cause.

15; 38. Edwin Scott was an American Bahá’í artist living in Paris.

16; 39. Yuhanna, or Johanna, Dawud (as he rendered his name) was for
a time a prominent figure in the Faith in the West and translated into
English ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s treatise Risálih-i-Madaníyyih, later translated by
Marzieh Gail and published under the title The Secret of Divine
Civilization.

17; 39. It is not clear which city is referred to.

18; 40. Trieste is on the Adriatic coast.

19; 40. Here and in a later section “Ḥijází” refers to chanting or singing of
a distinctive style and tonal scale. Yáfá is present-day Jaffa, Israel.

20; 40. In the case of Muslims, of course, “Ḥájí” refers to a person who
has performed the ḥájj, or pilgrimage to the holy sites in and near Mecca.
Perhaps Mr. Mumtází’s elder brother (who was quite a bit older) visited
Jerusalem as a Jew before accepting the Bahá’í Faith, which would
explain why Mr. Mumtází entitles him “Ḥájí” (here, although not in the
mention at the beginning of this account): Jews and Christians living in
Muslim lands who visited the holiest sites of their religion were called
“Ḥájí”.

21; 42. “‘Abbás Effendí” is generally how the non-Bahá’í public in
Palestine referred to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.

͟hán Varqá was the son of famed martyr Mirzá ‘Alí-
22; 43. ‘Azízu’lláh K

Muḥammad Varqá, the elder brother of martyr Rúḥu’lláh and Hand of the
Cause Valíyu’lláh Varqá, and the uncle of Hand of the Cause Dr. ‘Alí-
Muḥammad Varqá. He served on the first Spiritual Assembly of Ṭihrán.

The Pilgrim House mentioned was the Eastern, near the Shrine of
the Báb on Mount Carmel. The House of the Master was and is located at
what became the address 7 HaParsim Street, some minutes’ walk down
the mountain from the Shrine. The building that functioned at the time as
the Western Pilgrim House is at 4 HaParsim St. (The later Western Pilgrim
House is at 10 HaParsim St.)

23; 43. Mírzá Muḥsin Afnán was a son-in-law of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. In addition
to various distinctions he was the owner of the Western Pilgrim House
building at 4 HaParsim St.

24; 45. Hárúnu’r-Ras͟híd, renowned Abbasid Caliph, features in a number
of the “Arabian Nights” tales.

25; 45. “Fí amáni’lláh” is Arabic meaning “[Be] in the protection of God”,
and often said by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, as here, by way of dismissal.

26; 48. The Qájár dynasty ruled Írán from 1794 (or 1785 or 1796,
depending on the source) to 1925.

Among many other services, Badí‘ Bus͟hrú’í operated a school for
children of the Bahá’ís residing in the Holy Land. He attended the Syrian
Protestant College (later named the American University of Beirut)—as
did quite a few Bahá’ís from the Middle East—organized the Society of
Bahá’í Students there, and headed the Haifa chapter of the College’s
alumni association.

27; 50. While ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is quoted in this section speaking of the
burden of His correspondence, a reading of His Will and Testament
makes clear that by far the greatest burden He bore during His ministry
was the opposition of the Covenant-breakers and the persecution by the
Ottoman government that resulted from their calumnies—matters that He
takes up later in this account as well.
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s plaintive tones recorded in this section are echoed in

the accounts of other pilgrims and Haifa residents of this period—the last
few years of His life in this world. In the history God Passes By (p. 310)
Shoghi Effendi quotes ‘Abdu’l-Bahá saying, fewer than six months before
His ascension, “No strength is there left in Me wherewith to arise and
serve Thy loved ones . . . O Lord, My Lord! Hasten My ascension unto
Thy sublime Threshold . . . and My arrival at the Door of Thy grace
beneath the shadow of Thy most great mercy . . .”

The flow of letters and tablets to and from the Holy Land amounted
to the circulation of the life-force of the Faith, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was
always careful to maintain this flow, whatever the burden. In one of the
tablets found in Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (p. 193) He
writes, “O ye two seekers after truth! Your letter was received and its
contents noted . . . and I have therefore set about writing, in spite of much
pressing business, so that ye will know that ye are loved amongst us, and
also accepted in the Kingdom of God.” In God Passes By (p. 304) Shoghi
Effendi writes that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá ‹‹felt acutely the virtual stoppage of all
communication with most of the Bahá’í centers throughout the world››
caused by the disruptions of the First World War, and in Tablets of the
Divine Plan (p. 15) ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself states that by such
communication “my heart and soul may obtain joy and fragrance through
the remembrance of the friends.”

28; 51. The victories Mr. Mumtází was confident of seeing would be
spiritual, of course. The story is from a well-known ḥadít͟h, or Muslim
tradition, attending the Battle of the Trench, which was fought defending
Medina from siege. According to the tradition, sparks flew off the rock
struck by Muḥammad and flashed toward the south, north, and east.
These sparks, the Prophet then stated to His followers, had lit up the
palaces of Yemen, Syria (then ruled by the Eastern Roman, or Byzantine,
Empire), and Persia, and He saw those palaces opened to Him. In fact,
those areas later fell to Muslim forces. The Arch of Kisrá (or K͟husraw),
which still stands, formed a part of the royal palace at Ctesiphon, which
was the capital of the Persian Sassanid Empire and fell in 637. Dr. Yúnis
͟hán Afrúk͟htih writes in his Memories of Nine Years in ‘Akká that ‘Abdu’l-
K
Bahá often told the story of the besieged Muslims and the Prophet’s

promise.

See ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s elucidation of the future of the Arch of Kisrá in His
Memorials of the Faithful, pp. 19-20.

29; 53. Mírzá ‘Alí Muḥammad K  ͟hán Dihqán was from a prominent Bahá’í
family in S

͟híráz.
Herbert Samuel arrived in Jerusalem on June 30 to take his post as
British High Commissioner for Palestine. He made a visit earlier, in the
spring, which apparently is referred to here.

30; 55. Many scholars have offered textual analyses, including
classifications, of the works of Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and/or Shoghi
Effendi. Classifications might include structure or form, style or mode,
genre or type, voice or level, subject or topic, motif or theme, subject
matter or content, stage or phase, recipient or occasion. In his The
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, Vol. I, pp. 42-43, Adib Taherzadeh notes that
Bahá’u’lláh states there are nine categories of Bahá’í holy scripture, and
then gives an enumeration of these by the scholar Jináb Fáḍil
Mázindarání. The great Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl Gulpáygání in his The Bahá’í
Proofs, pp. 70-72, identifies four categories: laws and ordinances, prayers
and meditations, exegeses or “solutions” of the sacred scriptures of the
past, and discourses and exordiums. In his Logos and Civilization, p.
293ff., Nader Saiedi notes passages in the Persian Bayán in which the
Báb identifies four modes of revelation in Islám—verses, prayers,
commentaries, and discourses—and further discusses how the Báb
relates these modes to the Bayán itself, His Dispensation, and that of
Bahá’u’lláh in a hermeneutical tour de force.

In God Passes By (pp. 205-206) Shoghi Effendi categorizes the
revelations of the ‘Akká period as follows: ‹‹The first comprises those
writings which constitute the sequel to the proclamation of [Bahá’u’lláh’s]
Mission in Adrianople. The second includes the laws and ordinances of
His Dispensation, which, for the most part, have been recorded in the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas, His Most Holy Book. To the third must be assigned those
Tablets which partly enunciate and partly reaffirm the fundamental tenets
and principles underlying that Dispensation.›› Concerning the earlier,
Adrianople period he writes (ibid., pp. 170-176) of Bahá’u’lláh’s

proclamation of His Mission and Message in tablets in which He
addresses monarchs, ecclesiastical leaders, ambassadors, philosophers,
et al., together with numerous other tablets ‹‹in which the implications of
His newly-asserted claims were fully expounded.›› Among the
outpourings of the earliest, Bag ͟ hdád period—some of which Bahá’u’lláh
ordered cast into the Tigris River because no one was ready to absorb
them—Shoghi Effendi identifies (pp. 137-141) ‹‹epistles, exhortations,
commentaries, apologies, dissertations, prophecies, prayers, odes [and]
specific Tablets›› together with ‹‹homilies››, constituting the ‹‹doctrinal
and ethical . . . [and] mystical›› core of the new Revelation.

31; 56. “Marḥabá”, often said by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the pilgrims, is a
welcoming greeting and also an interjection meaning something like “Very
well” or “Well done”.

32; 58. The Kitáb-i-‘Ahd is the Book of the Covenant, found in Tablets of
Bahá’u’lláh revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas pp. 217-223.

33; 60. As he asserts here, by the time of Mr. Mumtází’s second
pilgrimage in 1955 the Bahjí Mansion had been cleared of Covenant-
breakers. While a few of their shacks remained near it, much of the area
around the Mansion had been developed by Shoghi Effendi with gardens.
The remaining structures were removed in 1957, in the culmination of an
extended legal process.

As is sadly apparent in this memoir, the Covenant-breakers not only
occupied the Mansion at the time of Mr. Mumtází’s first pilgrimage but
also targeted the pilgrims. A number of pilgrims and Haifa/‘Akká residents
mention in their memoirs being waylaid when visiting Bahjí.

34; 66. While ‘Abdu’l-Bahá showed forbearance toward the Covenant-
breakers, the Guardian initiated civil and legal proceedings to regain
custody of the Mansion of Bahjí. As stated in the previous note, they were
eventually evicted from the Mansion and its vicinity.

35; 68. Perhaps the reference is to Mírzá Muḥammad-‘Alí Falláḥ, an
Afnán, who studied at the Syrian Protestant College in Beirut and

sometimes interpreted for Western pilgrims in Haifa in the period that Mr.
Mumtází was on pilgrimage. “Muḥammad-‘Alí” was a common given
name, and over the years or decades there were several believers with
that name who lived and served faithfully in the Holy Land.

36; 69. In the pilgrimage account of George Latimer there is a passage
with echoes of this section in which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is quoted praising the
teaching work of a “short” woman in Germany; viz., Alma Knobloch. Alma
Knobloch is one of the believers immortalized by name in the Tablets of
the Divine Plan.

“Fujita” is Saichiro Fujita, the second Japanese to accept the Faith,
well known to Bahá’ís for attending ‘Abdu’l-Bahá during His visit to North
America and for valuable services rendered over a total of forty years in
the Holy Land. Mr. Fujita was serving in the Holy Land, including in the
Master’s House, at the time of Mr. Mumtází’s pilgrimage, and they would
have met. (See the photo on the title page.) Little could either have
imagined that some thirty-five years later they would together leave Japan
on a voyage to the Holy Land—Mr. Mumtází going on his second
pilgrimage and Mr. Fujita returning for good. For more on this see the first
two sections of the second pilgrimage account and the Afterword.

39; 76. This section refers to a talk given by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in San
Francisco at the Open Forum on October 10, 1912 and to a visit a few
days later to Phoebe Hearst’s estate about sixty kilometers away in
Pleasanton, near Dublin. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá brought up the bovine philosopher
in several of His talks in the West, and there was another bovine
encounter the preceding August, in Dublin, New Hampshire. (It is possible
that the two Dublins were conflated by the pilgrim in the hearing or
recalling of the story.) For a record of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s talk at the Open
Forum see The Promulgation of Universal Peace pp. 355-361; for a
summary see Maḥmúd’s Diary p. 313. The reader may notice that the

conversational give-and-take in Mr. Mumtází’s account is missing from
the record of the talk in Promulgation. Such give-and-take may have
occurred at the outset of the talk or before the talk began and not been
recorded.

In Some Answered Questions (pp. 297-299) ‘Abdu’l-Bahá speaks of
“four accepted methods of comprehension”, adding “the bounty of the
Holy Spirit” to the senses, reason, and tradition. Mr. Mumtází writes in this
section that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá told the pilgrims He tailored his remarks for His
listeners at the Open Forum, which may explain why the Holy Spirit is not
mentioned in Mr. Mumtází’s account. Incidentally, the talk recorded in
Promulgation contrasts the senses and reason but discusses neither
tradition nor the Holy Spirit. It should be pointed out that letters written on
behalf of Shoghi Effendi have stated, and analysis by researchers has
shown, that Promulgation is not an entirely rigorous or reliable record of
the talks ‘Abdu’l-Bahá gave on tour in North America in 1912.

Here and there in His tablets and talks ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states that the
animal is the supreme materialist and notes the comparative wisdom and
contentment of the cow or the bird with respect to the natural world. In
Tablets of the Divine Plan (p. 45), for example, He concludes a passage
on this theme: “Thus it becomes evident that in the matters of this world,
however much man may strive . . . he will be unable to earn the
abundance, the freedom and the independent life of a small bird.” (All
man can do, it seems, is ruin the bird’s environment.) In the conclusion to
the above talk, as recorded in The Promulgation of Universal Peace,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá states, “Strange indeed that after twenty years training in
colleges and universities man should reach such a station wherein he will
deny the existence of the ideal or that which is not perceptible to the
senses. Have you ever stopped to think that the animal already has
graduated from such a university? Have you ever realized that the cow is
already a professor emeritus of that university? For the cow without hard
labor and study is already a philosopher of the superlative degree in the
school of nature. The cow denies everything that is not tangible, saying, ‘I
can see! I can eat! Therefore, I believe only in that which is tangible!’
Then why should we go to the colleges? Let us go to the cow.” Mírzá
Maḥmúd Zarqání writes in his diary that the audience “burst into laughter”
at this denouement.

In the notes taken by ‘Alí Qulí K͟hán during his pilgrimage in 1906

(available here: www.bahai-library.com/ali-khan_pilgrim_notes_1906)
‘Abdu’l-Bahá is recorded getting to the nub of the matter: The freedom of
the cow to roam and the bird to soar “are of no consequence; while a
man who endures trials, and sacrifices ease and comfort to great
achievements, is endowed with true independence.” Hence for the human
true freedom—and wisdom and contentment—is spiritual.

In Promulgation ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His talk at the Open Forum
addresses the evolution of the human species—a common subject of his
talks before Western listeners—propounding the principle of originality of
species (i.e., the human species is not descended from another species).
He also contrasts Western empiricism and Eastern (under which He
includes Greek) rationalism.

No matter one’s epistemological bent, modern science has shown—
by such principles as the absence of an absolute frame of reference
(relativity theory in physics), uncertainty (quantum theory in physics),
incompleteness (logic and mathematics), and the observer effect (various
disciplines)—that there are insuperable limits to one’s grasp of reality,
whether objects or states or formal systems.

The Bahá’í Writings stress and praise education, knowledge,
intellectual attainment, and craftsmanship—see, among many other
sources, the tablets Ṭarázát, Tajallíyát, and Lawḥ-i-Ḥikmat from the
volume Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas—while
firmly locating their raison d’etre in a spiritual context: “By the one true
God! If learning be not a means of access to Him, the Most Manifest, it is
nothing but evident loss” (Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, p.
110).

40; 84. Here and at the end of the second account Mr. Mumtází refers to
the story of Solomon and the ants, found in the Qur’án and in different
versions in Jewish lore. Also, the heading of this section is taken from an
untranslated Persian prayer of Bahá’u’lláh (found in Ad‘íyyih-i-Ḥaḍrat-i-
Maḥbúb pp. 365-368) in which He quotes a supplication—rabbi ‘ariní
(literally “My Lord show me”)—originally appearing in the Qur’án in a
verse where Moses asks that the Lord reveal Himself but is refused by
Him (Qur’án 7:143; cf. Exodus 33:18-23). In this “blessed Day”,

Bahá’u’lláh states in the prayer, one may be granted one’s wish in
response to this supplication.

The reply from the Kingdom in the heading, “Behold, and thou shalt
see Me”, consists of two terms—unẓur, “behold”, and tarání, translated as
“thou shalt see Me”—taken from a passage in the above-mentioned
Qur’án verse 7:143: the two terms are actually separated in the original
passage but Bahá’u’lláh has omitted the intervening text and brought the
two words together to form a new phrase, as if to signify the new
Revelation. This phrase is also found in a tablet in Arabic addressed to
Áqá Mírzá Áqá Afnán (known as Núru’d-Dín) included in Tablets of
Bahá’u’lláh revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, p. 239 (p. 147 in the Persian
edition of Tablets after Aqdas). Incidentally, in the reference footnote on
page 239 the Qur’án verse number is given not as 7:143 but as 7:139,
which is Rodwell’s reckoning.

The thought Mr. Mumtází records having before visiting ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
—“Though wicked, sinful, and intemperate, we still seek from Thee a ‘seat
of truth’. . .” —is from the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf (see also Prayers
and Meditations no. CLX or Ad‘íyyih-i-Ḥaḍrat-i-Maḥbúb pp. 326-328).

In a number of His tablets Bahá’u’lláh identifies Himself as the One
Who conversed with Moses at Sinai and/or states that the voice heard by
Moses at Sinai has now been heard again, proclaiming the new
Revelation—see, for example, The Summons of the Lord of Hosts, p. 68
—and further stresses that it is not God in His Essence but rather in His
Manifestation Who was heard at Sinai and may be seen in this new Day—
see, for example, Gleanings no. XXVI (particularly p. 62). Bahá’u’lláh also
vigorously refutes any inference of co-equality or identity with God: see,
for example, Epistle to the Son of the Wolf pp. 41-44, 118-119, or more
generally on the station of the Manifestation The Kitáb-i-Íqán passim,
particularly p. 176 et seq. (U.S. edition). Also on this point see Shoghi
Effendi’s explication in “The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh”, found in the
compilation volume The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh pp. 97-157, especially
pp. 112-115.

(The Moses-at-Sinai theme is prominent in the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh
—see, for example, The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, paragraph 80 of the main text and
no. 111 of the Notes section; or Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh revealed after the
Kitáb-i-Aqdas, pp. 52-53, 107; or Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, pp.

117-118—and is treated in a study by Stephen N. Lambden entitled “The
Sinaitic Mysteries: Notes on Moses/Sinai Motifs in Bábí and Bahá’í
Scripture”, found in the publication Studies in the Bábí and Bahá’í
Religions, Vol. 5. On the Sinai motif in Bábí Scripture see, for example,
Selections from the Writings of the Báb, pp. 70, 72. Hand of the Cause
George Townshend notes in his glossary to Gleanings that Sinai itself can
signify the human heart, the place of God’s descent; cf. The Hidden
Words, Arabic 59 and 63.

Further to the non-co-equality point, a reading of the first full
paragraph of p. 7 of Shoghi Effendi’s The Promised Day is Come—see
also Selections from the Writings of the Báb pp. 87-88—as well as of the
latter part of the well-known Fire Tablet revealed by Bahá’u’lláh indicates
that the Manifestation of God occasionally speaks in a voice by which God
is referred to in the grammatical first person and the Manifestation
Himself in the second or third person.)

It is probably a safe assumption that Mr. Mumtází above is not
equating ‘Abdu’l-Bahá with the “Lord” of the Qur’án verse. Be that as it
may, in this account Mr. Mumtází uses expressions such as “lord of the
worlds” and “king of kings” and “creator of Paris and London” and “master
of the Qur’án” to refer to ’Abdu’l-Bahá. These locutions should be
appreciated for their rhetorical flourish—as expressive of the author’s
personality and cultural background—rather than for their doctrinal rigor.
More generally, the reader ought not to expect doctrinal precision in
personal reminiscences: the early Western Bahá’ís, for instance, tended
to liken ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to Christ, much to His dismay. In his works,
preeminently in his letter “The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh”, Shoghi
Effendi has addressed and clarified the respective stations of the Central
Figures of the Faith.

41; 88. By “today” Mr. Mumtází means 1959, some 39 years after the
pilgrimage. A little checking on the Internet reveals that in the late 1950s
one U.S. dollar was worth about 7 túmáns, or one túmán about 14 cents,
and what was worth one dollar in 1959 would be worth nearly 8 dollars in
2013\. The reader, if interested, can do the math.

42; 89. The s͟háhí was an old silver coin.

43; 90. Ḥájí Maḥmúd Qaṣṣábc͟hí was the chairman of the Spiritual
Assembly of Bag  ͟ hdád. He also funded the addition of three rooms to the
six that already existed in the Shrine of the Báb, and one of the doors to
those rooms was named after him by Shoghi Effendi.

44; 91. The S͟háh mentioned here is Aḥmad, the last of the Qájárs, who
was in his early twenties at the time. He is characterized by Shoghi
Effendi in The Promised Day is Come as a ‹‹boy-king . . . a mere cipher
and careless of his duties.››

45; 92. The quotation is from the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf.

46; 95. The verses the chanter of the Qur’án intoned are not identified. By
“holy place” and “holy vale” Ḥájí Muḥammad may be alluding both to
‘Akká/Haifa and to Ṭuwa. The latter is mentioned in the Qur’án in súrih 20
and súrih 79: in the former súrih, verses 9-48, the episode of the Burning
Bush, located “in the holy vale of Ṭuwa”, is recounted (cf. Exodus chs. 3
and 4); in the latter súrih, verses 16-19, the Lord speaks to Moses “in the
holy vale of Ṭuwa” near Mount Sinai and commands Him to go to
Pharaoh and tell him that He will guide Pharaoh to his Lord. In The Kitáb-
i-Íqán (p. 54 U.S. edition) this episode is also mentioned, placing Moses
“in the holy vale, situate in the wilderness of Sinai.” Ḥájí Muḥammad
seems to be subtly suggesting that in this Day the voice Moses heard at
Ṭuwa has been heard again and that the Qur’án-chanter may be guided
thereby.

Ḥájí Muḥammad was capable of speaking somewhat less allusively
or indirectly: One day a Christian priest came to his shop with shoes to be
repaired. Their conversation eventually turned to religion, and Ḥájí
Muḥammad remarked that the priest ought to worship the donkey rather
than the cross, because Jesus suffered on the latter whereas He was at
ease on the former. This anecdote and more on Ḥájí Muḥammad is
contained in the memoir of K   ͟halíl S

͟hahídí—who served for decades in the
Holy Land—translated and annotated by Ahang Rabbani.

47; 96. The last line is a paraphrase of a verse from Ḥáfiẓ.
On various websites there are a number of photographs of ‘Abdu’l-

Bahá posing with pilgrims, or mixed groups of pilgrims and Bahá’í Haifa
residents. Most of the photos whose years are given date from the late
1910s to 1921, the year of His passing, and most of the others seem to
be from the same period. In these photos He is shown sitting with small
groups of standing Western believers, while with larger groups of Eastern,
or mixed Eastern and Western, believers (posed at the Shrines or in front
of His House) He is standing when all others are standing, or sitting when
the persons in the front are sitting and those in the back are standing.
However, there is one photo showing Him sitting, on a chair placed on a
carpet laid on the ground, with a group of mostly Eastern believers who
are all standing, found on the title page of this document and also here:
www.bahai-biblio.org/centre-photo/gens/abdul-baha/abd-haifa/
abdhai~36m~Abdu'l-Baha-haifa.htm.

Mr. Mumtází’s youngest son recalls this photograph hanging on a
wall of the family home. The youngest son and a daughter-in-law of Mr.
Mumtází (his eldest son’s wife) have independently identified the man
with a mustache standing immediately behind ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as Mr.
Mumtází. This man does closely resemble Mr. Mumtází as he appears in
photos taken a few years later in Írán. There are a couple of persons
standing behind Mr. Mumtází who resemble his brother, Yúsuf Munfarid,
as he appears in a photo taken a few years later. The brother’s wife,
Munavvar K  ͟hánum, would have been with a separate group of Eastern
women.

(While the identification by two family members, including a son,
should suffice, it could be—and has been—suggested that the man
identified as Mr. Mumtází looks like he might be older than his early
twenties and further that a man of such comparatively young age would
not be standing front and center on such an occasion. The image of the
pilgrims is not sharp, though, and may not reflect age clearly. And,
although Mr. Mumtází writes several sections above that because of his
comparatively young age he tended to stay at the back of gatherings
during the pilgrimage, in this case there might have been some reason for
him to stand in front: perhaps he prepared the chair and carpet.)

48; 98. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was very much respected by the general public in
Palestine for His humanitarian activities, which ranged from almsgiving

and provision of medical care to large-scale famine relief in the years
during and just after the First World War, which the Ottoman Empire
fought on the losing side.

49; 99. The emperor is Czar Nicholas II, who abdicated in 1917 as
revolution swept Russia. The Bolsheviks triumphed, ushered in
communist rule, and executed Nicholas and his family. Bádkúbih, where
Mr. Mumtází’s Pilgrim House roommate Ustád Muṭallib was from, is
present-day Baku, Azerbaijan.

The references to the Imperial Russian consuls are regarding their
response to episodes of persecution of the Bahá’ís in Írán. In 1903,
during a period of pogrom-level persecution around the country, there
was an instance in Iṣfahán in which Bahá’ís fleeing mob violence were
offered sanctuary in the Russian consulate but then told to leave when
the consul did an about-face. The expelled Bahá’ís were set upon by the
riotous crowd. See Moojan Momen, The Bábí and Bahá’í Religions,
1844-1944: Some Contemporary Western Accounts, p. 376ff., concerning
this episode.

“Ḥakím Bás͟hí” is a title meaning “Chief Physician”. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is
likely referring to Mirzá Músá K ͟hán, a prominent believer in Qazvín. In his
memoir Dr. Ḥabíb Mu’ayyad, who was to serve as a doctor in the Holy
Land and later as a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the
Bahá’ís of Írán, writes of his journey to the Holy Land in 1907 and
mentions the hospitality shown his traveling party in Qazvín by “Mirzá
Músá K  ͟hán Ḥakím Bás͟hí”.

50; 100. Dr. Ḍíyá Bag

͟ hdádí (Zia Baghdadi), renowned for his services to
the Cause in the United States, was on an extended visit to the Holy
Land.

51; 104. Ismá‘íl Áqá served for many years in the Holy Land. He had his
own room in the House of the Master (to which Mr. Mumtází was taken
after he fainted) and three of the Tablets of the Divine Plan were revealed
in that room. In the last years of His life ‘Abdu’l-Bahá often confided in
him. Ismá‘íl Áqá was so distraught when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá passed away that
he attempted suicide, but he was discovered in time and lived into the

1930s.

Many of the accounts of the Persian and Western pilgrims and Holy
Land residents, including Mr. Mumtází’s in a section above, remark on the
very heavy burden imposed on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá by His voluminous
correspondence with Bahá’ís around the world. Yet ironically the same
accounts often portray the pilgrims making their own persistent demands
on the Master’s time and energy, in some instances lining up outside His
door for separate audiences one after the other—this in addition to the
meetings, dinners, Feasts, Holy Day observances, Shrine visitations, and
photographs they were privileged to have with Him in groups. Some
pilgrims succeeded in repeatedly gaining His presence for private
meetings (beyond any occasions they were actually summoned by Him)—
Mr. Mumtází himself is depicted trying to do so in this section and
successfully doing so in other sections of his account. But, to use one of
Mr. Mumtází’s favorite metaphors, perhaps the moths could not help
being drawn to the candlelight. Although the separation of Eastern
pilgrims into male and female groups continued (a concession to cultural
exigencies), other protocols for the pilgrims changed during the ministry
of the Guardian, as will be apparent in the second account.

Incidentally, the candle-and-moth trope is common in Persian (and
other) literature and is found in the Bahá’í Writings: e.g. (from Gleanings
no. CLI), “The everlasting Candle shineth in its naked glory. Behold how it
hath consumed every mortal veil. O ye moth-like lovers of His light! Brave
every danger, and consecrate your souls to its consuming flame.”

52; 106. The first mention of war in this section could refer to the First
World War, in which a number of men from Palestine—which was then
ruled by the Ottoman Empire, a combatant in the war—fought.

The two Indians were probably part of a contingent of Indian soldiers
attached to the armed forces that secured the post-First World War British
administration of Palestine, which was later formalized as the British
Mandate for Palestine. The war the Indians were to deploy to may have
been the uprising then beginning in ‘Iráq against the British administration
there, or a campaign being conducted by British forces in Waziristan, in
what is now Pakistan. H.M. Balyúzí in his book ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: The Centre
of the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh (p. 441) mentions a visit by two Indian

soldiers to the House of the Master in October 1919. These may have
been the same two, who perhaps periodically visited Haifa while stationed
nearby.

There is online a photograph of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá with pilgrims and
believers residing in Haifa and including what look to be two Indian
soldiers in the top row, here: www.bahai-biblio.org/centre-photo/gens/
abdul-baha/abd-haifa/abdhai~29m~Abdu'l-Baha-haifa.htm. This photo
and the aforementioned photo that shows Mr. Mumtází invite a
comparison. (To go to the other photo replace 29 with 36 in the URL.) A
notable presence in both photos is a person who resembles the
aforementioned Dr. Ḍíyá Bag  ͟ hdádí, standing on the far left on both
occasions. Dr. Bag ͟ hdádí was staying in the Holy Land during the first half
of 1920. Among several other prominent Bahá’ís appearing in one or both
of these photographs is Saichiro Fujita, standing above the Greatest
Name being held behind ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the photo with the Indian
soldiers, and in the middle of the uppermost row in the photo with Mr.
Mumtází. (He is wearing a greyish coat on both occasions.)

53; 108. The reference is to Mullá Abú-Ṭálib, by whom, according to
Shoghi Effendi in God Passes By, the banner of the Faith was
‹‹permanently planted in the Caucasus››. He and Ḥájí Mírzá Ḥaydar-‘Alí—
the great teacher of the Faith known as “the Angel of Mount Carmel”—
living their final years in Haifa, would often joke with each other in the
presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the pilgrims. Mullá Abú-Ṭálib lived to be
over a hundred years old, and as early as 1845 a Mullá Abú-Ṭálib is
recorded as having been arrested and tortured together with Quddús,
Mullá Ṣádiq K   ͟hurásání (Ismu’lláhu’l-Aṣdaq), and Mullá ‘Alí-Akbar
Ardistání.

The Archangel did not forget the Angel of Mount Carmel: the
following December Ḥájí Mírzá Ḥaydar-‘Alí was reunited with Mullá Abú-
Ṭálib, having been relocated by the Archangel, like his friend, from the
Pilgrim House in the Holy Land to the Concourse in the Abhá Kingdom.

54; 111. The war mentioned is the Franco-Syrian War. “S ͟hám” here
refers to Damascus (although more generally it refers to the area roughly
comprising the modern-day states of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Israel).

From Damascus the S    ͟hám route continued to Bag͟ hdád. Another land
route went much further north, well past the Lebanon Mountains before
turning inland.

“Mírzá ‘Alí Áqá” is presumably a reference to the Afnán who was the
father of Hand of the Cause Ḥasan Balyúzí, correspondent of the
orientalist E.G. Browne, and minister of the Persian government.

55; 112. Urdíbihis͟ht is the second month of the modern Íránian calendar,
known as the Solar Hijrí calendar; 1309 is Anno Hegirae. The date given
corresponds to 29 April 1930.

56; 114. This date is given according to the Gregorian calendar in the
original Persian account. In the biography Martha Root: Lioness at the
Threshold it is stated that Ms. Root arrived in S

͟híráz “toward the end of
April” and that “on 4 May 1930 she was taken to the house in which the
Báb had first declared His mission . . .”

57; 118. Mr. Mumtází was among a number of persons accompanying
Ms. Root. Another person later to pioneer to Japan accompanied Ms.
Root: Yadu’lláh Raf‘at, or Y.A. Rafaat, who served as Ms. Root’s
interpreter for her journey through Syria, ‘Iráq, and Írán. The first Tokyo
and National Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds were located in Mr. Raf‘at’s former home in
Japan’s capital, and the current building housing the National and Tokyo
Centers stands on the same property. Mr. Raf‘at and the Mumtází family,
together with the Katírá’í and Muqbil families, constituted the vanguard of
a veritable phalanx of Persian pioneers who settled in Japan beginning in
the 1950s and who rendered, are still rendering, and whose descendants
now render, all kinds of service to the Faith around the world.

While quite a few Western Bahá’ís visited or lived in Írán in the
twentieth century, perhaps none had a more profound spiritual effect on
their hosts than Martha Root and Keith Ransom-Kehler—the latter of
whom passed away in Iṣfahán in 1933 and was designated ‹‹the first
American martyr›› and called ‹‹fearless and brilliant›› by the Guardian
(God Passes By, p. 398), who also praised her ‹‹high distinction,
indomitable will, and unswerving, exemplary loyalty›› (Messages to
America p. 3); both of whom were appointed Hand of the Cause

posthumously by him; and the former of whom was referred to by him
(God Passes By p. 386) as ‹‹that archetype of Bahá’í itinerant teachers
and the foremost Hand raised by Bahá’u’lláh since ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
passing›› as well as ‹‹Leading Ambassadress of His Faith and Pride of
Bahá’í teachers, whether men or women, in both the East and the West››
whose teaching journeys ‹‹established a record which constitutes the
nearest approach to the example set by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself›› in His
journeys. In oral and written reminiscences Persian believers have
spoken most movingly of their presence in Írán.

The notes below are for the second account.

58; 120. Saichiro Fujita, who had served for many years in the Holy Land,
was sent to his homeland by the Guardian on the approach of the Second
World War and in 1955 given permission to return. He accompanied Mr.
and Mrs. Mumtází to Haifa.

59; 121. NB: Concerning the conversations recorded in this account, the
reader is reminded both that text within quotation marks should not be
considered a literal transcript and that this account was dictated by Mr.
Mumtází in English and as such he is offering his own translation of what
he recalls of the Guardian’s remarks (see the Foreword).

60; 122. The Mumtázís were late arriving in Haifa because they had
delayed their departure from Japan for two weeks waiting for Mr. Fujita to
settle his affairs. He would stay in Haifa for the rest of his life.

61; 123. The word “centers” here refers not strictly to the Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds
(for a Bahá’í Center in that sense existed in only two places—Tokyo and
Amagasaki—at the time) but rather to all localities with a Bahá’í presence.
“Center” in this broad sense appears often in the Guardian’s messages
and in letters written on his behalf, and also in this account. (Cf. Tablets of
the Divine Plan, pp. 101-102, 105-106: “collective center”, an interesting
concept seeming to have both ontological and sociological aspects.)

Here and in sections below Mr. Mumtází uses the translation “set up”
where “form” or “establish” would be more appropriate. In further such

instances the more appropriate word has been substituted without
editorial brackets.

62; 124. In the Epistle to the Son of the Wolf, Bahá’u’lláh states, “A kindly
tongue is the lodestone of the hearts of men.”

This first meeting with the Guardian probably took place on
December 27 in the late morning. It was the first of two meetings that day.
The reader will notice that Mr. Mumtází’s words and actions in this
account reach an emotional and reverent pitch not usually found in
Western pilgrims’ reminiscences of the Guardian. This reflects differences
of culture and language between the East and West in general as well as
the Persian and Western believers in particular.

In Mr. Mumtází’s original first pilgrimage account, written in Persian,
expressions such as haykal-i-mubárak, meaning “Blessed Temple” or
“Blessed Person”, are applied to the young Shoghi Effendi, who was not
yet Guardian; also the pre-nominal honorific ḥaḍrat-i—which is translated
as “His Holiness” when applied to divinely guided personages and can be
rendered as “His Honor” when applied to high-ranking or highly respected
persons—is always used before his name. While most instances of these
terms have not been retained in the translation of the first account, the
pre-nominal “our beloved”, which invariably appears in the original second
account in references to the Guardian, has been retained.

In this and other sections Mr. Mumtází uses the phrases “thanks
God”, “thanks to God”, and “praise to God” where “thanks be to God” or
“praise be to God” would be better translations; also “Administration
Order” where he means the Administrative Order; also “our friends”
where “the Bahá’ís” or “the believers” is meant and “the friends” is the
usual usage. In further such instances the correct or more standard or
usual form has been substituted without editorial brackets.

63; 125. The original verse can be found on any number of Persian-
language blogs, but the author could not be determined.

64; 125. The sisters Jessie and Ethel Revell devotedly served in various
capacities in the Holy Land.

65; 126. In a cabled message to the Bahá’í world in 1953 Shoghi Effendi,
announcing the completion of the superstructure of the Shrine of the Báb,
described the Shrine as the “Queen of Carmel enthroned God’s
Mountain, crowned glowing gold, robed shimmering white, girdled
emerald green, enchanting every eye . . .” Mr. Mumtází’s version may be
his translation of part of a message Shoghi Effendi sent to the Persian
Bahá’ís.

66; 127. Mr. Mumtází’s first meeting with the Guardian (and probably the
last) was private and took place at his residence. The other meetings,
including this second one, occurred at the Eastern Pilgrim House, in the
vicinity of the Shrine of the Báb, in the company of other Persian male
pilgrims, who are the “us” the Guardian was speaking to.

As was the case during the ministry of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Persian
women formed a separate pilgrimage party, while the Western pilgrims’
groups were mixed. Needless to say, this segregation was not based on
Bahá’í precepts but rather was a concession to the Middle Eastern
cultural milieu. As an examination of religious history would reveal, no
matter how forcefully a new divine dispensation may be proclaimed,
cultural milieu does not transform overnight.

67; 128. In his history God Passes By (p. 253) and in the compilation of
his messages The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh (pp. 78-79), Shoghi Effendi
quotes Bahá’u’lláh: “In the East the light of His Revelation hath broken; in
the West the signs of His dominion have appeared”, and “Should they
attempt to conceal its light on the continent, it will assuredly rear its head
in the midmost heart of the ocean, and, raising its voice, proclaim, ‘I am
the life-giver of the world!’”

The book Messages from the Universal House of Justice, 1968-1973

(pp. 74-75) contains a message addressed in May 1971 to the South
Pacific Oceanic Conference in which it is stated, ‹‹Recalling the promise
of Bahá’u’lláh, “Should they attempt to conceal its light on the continent, it
will assuredly rear its head in the midmost heart of the ocean, and, raising
its voice, proclaim, ‘I am the life-giver of the world!’” we now witness its
fulfillment in the vast area of the Pacific Ocean, in island after island
mentioned by the Master in the Tablets of the Divine Plan.›› Further, the

book Messages from the Universal House of Justice, 1963-1986 (p. 635)
contains a message hailing the dedication in August 1984 of the House of
Worship in Western Samoa in which it is stated that ‹‹the raising up of this
House of Worship [is] a further significant fulfillment of the Blessed
Beauty’s promise››. Another message (p. 564), referring to the Samoa
Temple when it was still being built, states that it is rising in the ‹‹midmost
heart›› of the Pacific Ocean. It could be inferred from these messages,
particularly from the phrase “further significant fulfillment”, that the
realization of this promise of the Pacific has progressed in stages or steps
and will continue to do so in the future (for as long as the “light on the
continent” is concealed, at minimum).

68; 129. Hand of the Cause D   ͟hikru’lláh K

͟hádim had visited Japan earlier
in 1955 and, accompanied by Agnes Alexander (appointed Hand of the
Cause in 1957) and Mr. Mumtází, made a teaching trip to Hiroshima

͟hádim cabled the
which resulted in the first enrollments in that city. Mr. K
news of the enrollments to the Holy Land and the Guardian answered in a
cable that he was “delighted”. In a letter written in 1952 on behalf of
Shoghi Effendi to the Tokyo Spiritual Assembly (quoted in Traces that
Remain: A Pictorial History of the Early Days of the Bahá’í Faith Among
the Japanese p. 238), it had been stated that “in Hiroshima, where the
people suffered so mercilessly during the war; they have a special right—
the people of that city—to hear of Bahá’u’lláh’s Message of peace and
brotherhood.”

69; 129. It is not certain whether the latter sentence is the Guardian’s
remark or Mr. Mumtází’s comment.

The first Bahá’í pioneers to Japan arrived in 1914: George Augur in
June and Agnes Alexander in November. The first Bahá’í visitors to Japan
—Howard Struven and C.M. Remey—arrived in late December 1909, in
the midst of a teaching trip around the world.

70; 130. As is made clear elsewhere in this account and in various
sources, the intention was to establish this Assembly in April 1957, and
thus the statement ascribed to the Guardian in the first sentence that it
was to be established “next year” can be explained either as a

misunderstanding by the pilgrim if the remark was made at the meeting
on December 27, or as a remark made by the Guardian at a meeting in
January 1956.

Here and in sections below Mr. Mumtází uses the translation
“select(ing)” where “elect(ing)” would be more appropriate. In further such
instances the more appropriate word has been substituted without
editorial brackets.

71; 130. In sections below where the “National Spiritual Assembly of
Japan” is mentioned this is a reference, as in this section, to the Regional
Spiritual Assembly of North East Asia, which was elected in Tokyo in April
1957\. Its jurisdiction was Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Macau and, initially, Hainan Island and Sakhalin Island. This Assembly
was also referred to as a National Spiritual Assembly, despite its regional
jurisdiction. Mr. Mumtází was elected to this Assembly, a photograph of
which can be viewed online here: www.bahai-library.com/east-asia/traces/
56-61.html; scroll down to the second photo.

In a message to the first Convention of the Bahá’ís of North East Asia
(see Japan Will Turn Ablaze! p. 80 rev. ed.), Shoghi Effendi hailed the
election of this Regional Spiritual Assembly, calling its formation an
‹‹auspicious event, which posterity will regard as the culmination of a
process initiated, half a century ago, in the capital city of Japan, under the
watchful care and through the direct inspiration of the Centre of the
Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh . . .››

In 1974 the Regional Assembly went out of existence and the
National Spiritual Assembly of Japan was elected. Korea had formed an
N.S.A. in 1964, Taiwan in 1967, and Hong Kong did so in 1974 with
Macau under its jurisdiction; Macau formed an N.S.A. in 1989.

72; 131. Mr. Rihei Sako later served on the Spiritual Assembly of Kobe.

The word “Motto” appears here and in a later section. It is unclear
what this refers to, but perhaps it is the principle of the oneness of
humankind.

73; 132. The N.S.A. of New Zealand was formed under the sponsorship
of the N.S.A. of Australia and New Zealand. Like that of North East Asia

seated in Japan, the third and fourth Assemblies listed here were planned
to be regional in jurisdiction, encompassing the South Pacific and South
East Asia, respectively. In a letter written in July 1957 to the N.S.A. of
Australia, Shoghi Effendi states that the emergence of the Regional
Spiritual Assembly of North East Asia marked the establishment of ‹‹a
spiritual axis, extending from the Antipodes to the northern islands of the
Pacific Ocean . . .››

Here and there in this and other sections the words “and”, “of”, “to”,
and “the” are omitted in the original account. The words “to” and “the”
have been inserted in editorial brackets in this section, but henceforth
such words are inserted without brackets.

74; 133. The Guardian made a substantial financial contribution toward
the purchase of the Tokyo Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds, and others—including Hand
of the Cause Amelia Collins and the U.S. N.S.A.—also generously
contributed, but there was still a shortfall; Mr. Mumtází then contributed a
sum which made possible the purchase. This was the second Ḥaẓíratu’l-
Quds in Japan. Mr. Mumtází donated the building and property for the
first, in the Mukonoso district of the city of Amagasaki, between Osaka
and Kobe. (It is referred to in a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi
found in Japan Will Turn Ablaze! as the “Mukonoso Center”.)

In response to the shortfall for the Tokyo Center, the Guardian had
stated through his secretary that he saw no objection to selling the
Amagasaki Center in favor of the Tokyo Center—which was to be the seat
of the future National Spiritual Assembly and whose acquisition, as such,
was a goal of the Ten-Year Crusade—but Mr. Mumtází’s contribution
obviated the need. In a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi in English
to Mr. Mumtází, this contribution was praised as “a further sign of the
dynamic spirit which animates you in all of your services.”

Concerning the incorporation of the Tokyo Assembly, which was
granted in April 1955, the aforementioned Yadu’lláh Raf‘at (see the
epilogue of the first pilgrimage account) played an important part as
liaison with government officials, and other members of the Assembly
helped with the translation and preparation of documents. A photograph

of this Assembly can be viewed online here: www.bahai-library.com/east-
asia/traces/62-63.html; scroll down to the third photo.

75; 134. The meaning is that just as two Centers have been acquired so
should endowments be acquired.

76; 134. As a matter of fact, difficulties arose and Mr. Mumtází was not
able to contribute land for an endowment. Some years later his eldest
son, Rúḥu’lláh Mumtází, made a contribution of land for that purpose,
fulfilling his father’s pledge.

77; 135. “Ken” is translated as “prefecture” and is analogous to a state or
a province; “fu” refers to regions associated with certain urban areas and
having the status of a prefecture; “to” denotes the capital, Tokyo.

In 1954 Hyogo Prefecture became the second area in Japan to form
a Spiritual Assembly, after Tokyo, where an L.S.A. was formed first in
1932 and after the Second World War in 1948. In 1956 the Hyogo
Assembly was superseded by three Assemblies formed in cities within the
prefecture: Kobe, Nishinomiya, and Amagasaki. A photograph of the
Hyogo Assembly can be viewed online here: www.bahai-library.com/east-
asia/traces/62-63.html; scroll down to the second photo.

78; 138. By “organizations” here is meant Bahá’í institutions. In the Ten-
Year Crusade, 1953-1963, the Guardian assigned several of the older or
more mature national Bahá’í communities, such as those of Írán and the
United States, responsibility for supervising and assisting a number of
younger or smaller national communities in the achievement of expansion
and consolidation goals. Responsibility for Japan (and the other
communities of North East Asia except Hong Kong) was assigned to the
United States. Until 1957 there was no Spiritual Assembly whose
jurisdiction encompassed the entire national community of Japan
(although the Tokyo Assembly assumed some such functions de facto),
and the guidance and supervision of the U.S. N.S.A. in the initial years of
the Ten-Year Crusade was crucial.
Concerning the Ten-Year Crusade, see the Guardian’s majestic

announcement and exposition of it in Messages to the Bahá’í World,
1950-1957.

79; 140. Today the privilege of casting ballots at District or Unit
Conventions to elect the delegates to the National Convention is not
limited to persons living in communities which have a Local Assembly.

80; 142. The North East Asia Spiritual Assembly was incorporated in
February 1959.

81; 145. In the typescript it is omitted who must encourage the Japanese
women, but presumably it is the Bahá’ís.

82; 146. It is not specified whether these last remarks are the Guardian’s
or Mr. Mumtází’s.

83; 147. The Nikko Conference, or formally the Asian Regional Teaching
Conference, was held in the resort city of Nikko—which the great travel-
teacher Keith Ransom-Kehler visited in 1931 and effusively praised—in
the mountains north of Tokyo in September 1955. It was organized by the
L.S.A. of Tokyo under the auspices of the Asia Teaching Committee of
the N.S.A. of the United States. Hand of the Cause D  ͟hikru’lláh K

͟hádim
attended as the Guardian’s representative. Bahá’ís gathered from around
the Far East and the Pacific region. A conference photograph can be
viewed online here: www.bahai-library.com/east-asia/traces/51-55.html;
scroll down to section 55.

Incidentally, shortly before she passed away Ms. Ransom-Kehler
stated in a letter to Agnes Alexander that she liked Japan more than any
other country she visited (History of the Bahá’í Faith in Japan, 1914-1938
p. 82).

84; 148. Most of the Assemblies were incorporated, others registered; in
some countries these might have been the same. Here and in a section
below “England” refers to the British Isles.

85; 148. The numbers given clearly refer to more than just “countries”: a

more apt term would be “territories”, which is used in the Guardian’s
messages and in the volumes of The Bahá’í World in reference to the
Ten-Year Crusade and which encompasses various polities and places
such as countries, colonies, principalities, islands, etc.

Statistics recorded by Mr. Mumtází are given as they are. The
compilation volume Messages to the Bahá’í World, 1950-1957 and
volumes XII and XIII of The Bahá’í World contain information on the goals
and achievements of the Ten-Year Crusade. See particularly Messages
pp. 75-120, where many matters relating to the remarks the Guardian
makes to Mr. Mumtází about the Ten-Year Crusade are elucidated.

86; 149. The northernmost point is identified elsewhere as “Franklin” in
Canada, the opening of which was a goal of the Ten-Year Crusade. The
“Franklin Islands in the Arctic Circle” are mentioned in the Tablets of the
Divine Plan, in a tablet addressed to the Bahá’ís of Canada and
Greenland. Concerning “islands” in Mr. Mumtází’s quotation of the
Guardian: Many of the Ten-Year Crusade’s goal territories located in the
northern and southern extremities were islands.

87; 150. Although not made explicit in the typescript, presumably these
remarks are the Guardian’s.

Anent the word “race”: A letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi in
July 1957 to the newly elected Regional Spiritual Assembly of North East
Asia—whose membership comprised two Japanese, three Persians, one
African-American, and three Caucasian Americans—it is stated that the
Guardian was “very happy to see that your Assembly has represented on
it members of the three great races of mankind . . .” In the publication
Bahá’í Faith, The: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, a
list is given of 71 “races represented in the Bahá’í world community”—a
usage which seems close to “nationality” or “ethnicity”.

88; 151. Although not made explicit in the typescript, presumably these
remarks are the Guardian’s.

89; 152. Cf. the following translations by Shoghi Effendi: “Well is it with
him who fixeth his gaze upon the Order of Bahá’u’lláh”, from the Persian

Bayán; and “Soon will the present-day order be rolled up, and a new one
spread out in its stead”, Gleanings no. IV.

90; 152. Particularly in his earlier messages, Shoghi Effendi sometimes
uses the term “International House of Justice” or “Supreme House of
Justice” for the institution commonly known today among Bahá’ís as the
Universal House of Justice. The most literal translation of the original
Arabic—bayt al-‘adl al-a‘ẓam—would be “Supreme House of Justice”. Mr.
Mumtází’s use of “International” in his translation reflects the Guardian’s
occasional usage.

91; 153. In an April 1955 message Shoghi Effendi states that 36,000
square meters have been purchased on Mount Carmel for the site of the
Mas͟hriqu’l-Ad

͟ hkár.

92; 153. Concerning the Major Plan of God, Shoghi Effendi in his
messages writes not strictly of “revolutions” but more generally of an
essentially inscrutable yet manifestly turbulent worldwide process of
disintegration that will inevitably conduce to world unity. For a succinct
summary of both the Major Plan and Minor Plan of God see the Riḍván
155 message of the Universal House of Justice.

93; 158. Four structures have since been built on Mount Carmel: the
International Archives Building, the Seat of the Universal House of Justice,
the Center for the Study of the Texts, and the International Teaching
Center; the fifth, the International Bahá’í Library, is yet to be built. (The
“building for the Guardians”, perforce, will not be built; the Teaching
Center, perforce, is staffed by Counsellors rather than Hands.) The
Universal House of Justice, in its 1987 letter on the Arc Project, states that
in the future the Library ‹‹will serve as an active center for knowledge in
all fields, and it will become the kernel of great institutions of scientific
investigation and discovery.››

Concerning the functions of the Universal House of Justice and the
Guardian: In Shoghi Effendi’s message, “The Dispensation of
Bahá’u’lláh”, Bahá’u’lláh is quoted (from Kalimát-i-Firdawsíyyih, one of the
tablets revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas) stating that the members of the

Universal House of Justice are “to take counsel together regarding those
things which have not outwardly been revealed in the Book . . .” while, in
Shoghi Effendi’s own words, the Guardian ‹‹interprets what has been
specifically revealed . . .››

94; 159. In the Kitáb-i-Aqdas Bahá’u’lláh indicates the duration of His
Revelation to be at least “a full thousand years”, whereas ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in
a tablet quoted by Shoghi Effendi in the compilation volume The World
Order of Bahá’u’lláh (p. 102), states that “the Bahá’í cycle . . . must
extend over a period of at least five hundred thousand years.” In God
Passes By (p. 100) Shoghi Effendi explains that the Bahá’í Revelation is
to be ‹‹hailed as the promise and crowning glory of past ages and
centuries, as the consummation of all the Dispensations within the Adamic
Cycle, inaugurating an era of at least a thousand years’ duration, and a
cycle destined to last no less than five thousand centuries . . .››

Regarding the future Manifestations, cf. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as quoted in
God Passes By (p. 99) and in The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh (p. 111):
“Concerning the Manifestations that will come down in the future ‘in the
shadows of the clouds’, know verily that in so far as their relation to the
source of their inspiration is concerned they are under the shadow of the
Ancient Beauty. In their relation, however, to the age in which they
appear, each and every one of them ‘doeth whatsoever He willeth’.”
“Ancient Beauty”, of course, refers to Bahá’u’lláh.

95; 160. “‘Ut͟hmán” is “Ottoman”; “Qis͟hlih” is “kishle”, meaning the
barracks of Ottoman forts or citadels. The barracks were often used as
jails or prisons.

96; 161. Obviously Mr. Mumtází is not recalling personal “memories” of
the incarceration of Bahá’u’lláh but rather is imagining the conditions of
those times. Aḥmad Jarráh, an Ottoman Army officer, and his brother
Amín Effendí, an ‘Akká municipal official, both embraced the Faith.

97; 161. The cell Bahá’u’lláh occupied did have windows, from which He
would acknowledge the pilgrims gathered beyond the walls of the citadel
to catch a glimpse of Him, but certainly the interior of the complex of cells

confining the Holy Family would have been quite dark.

98; 163. The tablet, chair, and bed were in a building where Bahá’u’lláh
sometimes stayed during visits to the Garden.

99; 165. In his introduction to A Traveller’s Narrative, Prof. Edward
Granville Browne wrote of Bahá’u’lláh, with Whom he was privileged to
have five interviews (actually more like audiences) over several days, “No
need to ask in whose presence I stood, as I bowed myself before one
who is the object of a devotion and love which kings might envy and
emperors sigh for in vain!”

100; 166. Making “a tour around” means circumambulating the Shrine.
The “Sign” is the Greatest Name; the “streets” are the paths of the Shrine
gardens.

101; 168. The poet could not be identified.

102; 170. Both ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the Guardian forbade (often in vain) the
Persian pilgrims from the kissing of their feet.

103; 173. Robert Imagire, a Japanese-American pioneer, played a
prominent part in the renewal of the Faith in Japan after the Second
World War.

Among Agnes Alexander’s distinctions are mention by name in the
Tablets of the Divine Plan, appointment as Hand of the Cause, and being
the first Bahá’í in the Hawaiian Islands, the second to pioneer to Japan,
and the first to teach the Faith in Korea. She served the Faith in Japan
over the successive periods of the ministries of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’ and the
Guardian, the custodianship of the Hands of the Cause, and the
leadership of the Universal House of Justice. Shoghi Effendi once wrote to
her (quoted in Japan Will Turn Ablaze! p. 9) that she was a ‹‹radiant
herald›› whose ‹‹glorious services in those remote regions of the earth
are never to be forgotten.››
