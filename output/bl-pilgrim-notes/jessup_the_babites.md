The Master Builder

By Ernest Neal Lyon
T h e lowliest work he perfecteth,              More wondrous still! Of earthly clay,

Transforming, by his care,                      Misshapen, marred by sin.
The humble hut of Nazareth                      H e buildeth temples, day by day,
To many mansions fair.                          That he may work therein.
Shall Selfishness deny him sway,

Or Folly bar the door ?
Dear Master, make our hearts, we pray,

Thy dwelling evermore!
