PREFACE
THE successive volumes of The Baha’i World have come to be anticipated by Baha’is as the record of
their own collective endeavours on behalf of their Faith, of the establishment and development of its
administrative order throughout the world and as the source of data, both historical and statistical, relating to
the rise of that Faith during its formative age.

By librarians and students The Baha’i World is becoming ever more widely known as a source of
authentic information about the aims, tenets, history, activities, organization and growth of the Baha’i Faith.
The editors therefore have always in mind the preservation of an even balance between the presentation of
material of supreme interest to believers and of a fair and objective picture to enquirers. In this they are guided
by the policy of Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of the Baha’i Faith, who directed the compilation of the successive
volumes from I to XII covering the years 1925 to 1954. The first volume, known as Baha’i Year Book, was in
fact a one-year survey; the next seven volumes were biennial, terminating in 1940; volume IX recorded the four
years from 1940 to 1944; volume X was again biennial and volumes XI and XII presented the periods 1946 to
1950 and 1950 to 1954 respectively. All these volumes were published in the United States under the aegis of
the National Spiritual Assembly, volume I being compiled by an editorial committee of American Baha’is, and
the remainder by an international board of editors, all under the supervision of the Guardian of the Faith.
Volume XIII, which recorded the passing of the Guardian and the course and completion of his Ten Year
Crusade, covered the entire period from 1954 to 1963 and was produced under the supervision of the Universal
House of Justice, which thenceforth assumed responsibility for publication. Volumes XIV, XV and XVI
covered the years 1963 to 1968, 1968 to 1973 and 1973 to 1976 respectively.

This volume, XVII, relating to the years 1976 to 1979, records the centenary observation in the Holy
Land in June 1977 of the termination of Baha’u’llah’s confinement in the prison-city of ‘Akka; progress made
towards restoration of the House of ‘Abdu’llah Pasha and towards construction of the permanent Seat of the
Universal House of Justice; the holding in the Holy Land in May 1978 of the fourth International Convention;
the laying of the cornerstones for Baha’i Houses of Worship in India and Samoa; the holding of eight
International Teaching Conferences; the initiation in December 1977 of the first Baha’i full-time radio station
in the world at Otavalo, Ecuador; the successful completion of the Five Year Plan launched at Ridvan 1974; the
announcement in December 1978 of the inauguration at Ridvan 1979 of a Seven Year global teaching plan
constituting yet another stage in the unfoldment of ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s Divine Plan, and the resumption in Iran on a
scale unprecedented in recent history of persecutions and hardships directed against the Persian Baha’i
community and the holy places of the Faith.

INTRODUCTION
AIMS AND PURPOSES O F THE BAHA’I FAITH

David Hofman
RELIGION has two objectives, the regeneration of men and the advancement of mankind. All men
have been created to carry forward an ever advancing civilization proclaims Baha’u’llah, and The purpose of
the one true God, exalted be His glory, in revealing Himself unto men is to lay bare those gems that lie hidden
within the mine of their true and inmost selves.

These aims of religion, universal and eternal, nevertheless have been conditioned to the capacities of
each age or dispensation and the great religions of the past have developed their social orders within generally
definable times and areas. Judaism, for instance, attained its peak under Solomon and was confined, before the
dispersion, to the Near East; Zoroastrianism remained Persian until the Arab conquest and the settlement of a
remnant in Western India; Christianity became the religion of European civilization; the building of the nation
state undertaken by Islam remained a Muslim experiment until feudal Europe learned the lesson and its city
states gave way to and adopted the more advanced order. It has remained for the Baha’i religion to declare and
promote the cause of world order -- the sine qua non of its existence -- and to disclose the concomitant unities
of religion, of mankind and of historical purpose. ‘Unity of family, of tribe, of city-state, and nation have been
successively attempted and fully established. World unity is the goal towards which a harassed humanity is
striving. Nation-building has come to an end. The anarchy inherent in state sovereignty is moving towards a
climax. A world, growing to maturity, must abandon this fetish, recognize the oneness and wholeness of human
relationships, and establish once for all the machinery that can best incarnate this fundamental principle of its
life.’1

Religion sees the course of history as an organic process, moving towards the full realization of all the
potentialities implanted in man. The vicissitudes, the great advances, the hiatuses it regards as the natural
unfoldment of that process just as the succession of bud, leaf, flower and fruit is the natural unfoldment in the
life of a tree; or infancy, childhood, youth and maturity in that of a man. Indeed, Baha’i scripture explains, the
process is the same. The sun is the effective agent in the organic life of the earth; religion in that of humanity.
The Sun of Truth is the Word of God upon which depends the education of those who are endowed with the
power of understanding and of utterance.2 The creative Word, revealed in each stage of human progress by a
Manifestation of God, and conditioned to the requirements of the time, is the effective agent in the long, single

\[2\] Baha’u’llah, Daryay-i-Danish.
process of humanity’s development from infancy to World Order. This truth is enshrined in all revealed religion
although it needs the illumination of Baha’u’llah’s revelation to enable men to perceive it. ‘The first picture
presented in the Bible is that of human unity in its simplest form; that of a single family. The last picture is that
of a unity manifold and universal in which all kindreds and tongues and peoples and nations are gathered into
one and unified in the enjoyment of a common worship, a common happiness, a common glory.
‘The great problem which, according to the

Bible, confronts the human race in its progress is that of advancing from the barest, baldest unity through a long
experience of multiplying diversities till ultimately a balance between the two principles is struck, poise is
gained and the two forces of variety and unity are blended in a multiple, highly developed world fellowship, the
perfection of whose union was hardly suggested in the primitive simplicity of early man.’3

This spiritual view of evolution is the constant theme of religion. Each revelation refers to the past,
looks forward to the future and concentrates upon the immediate need for spiritual regeneration and
enlightenment. The Prophet evokes in human hearts a sacrificial love which transcends self-interest and causes
the early believers to dedicate themselves entirely to the practice and diffusion of the new message. As it
spreads it works like leaven in society, reforming its morals, uplifting its vision and promoting a greater
diffusion of love in social action.

‘World history at its core and in its essence is the story of the spiritual evolution of mankind. From this
all other activities of man proceed and round it all other activities revolve.’4

Unlike the revelations of the past, the Baha’i revelation releases not only the creative Word necessary
to the renewal of spiritual vitality in the human spirit, but embodies that divine energy in an administrative
order capable of bringing within its shade all the diversified ethnic groups and myriad types of the human race,
who may find within its wide embrace a full, happy and purposeful life. Baha’i activity therefore is directed not
only, as in the past, to the spreading of the Word, but to the establishment of the fabric of that Order which,
enshrined within the creative Word itself, becomes the chief instrument for the further diffusion and social
application of the Divine Message. This World Order, which the Baha’i Faith exists to establish, is none other
than that long-promised Kingdom in which peace, justice and brotherhood shall prevail universally and ‘the
earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.’5 The
establishment of this World Order is dependent upon the regeneration of mankind which must turn again to
God and recognize His purpose. The two aims of religion are, therefore, interacting and interdependent.

Such a world-shaking transformation cannot be brought about by any movement of reform, however
disinterested, nor by any unaided human effort. Modern man has turned away from God, and bereft of his
traditional sanctions, has inevitably wrecked his old order which, in truth, is lamentably inadequate to modern
conditions and is not susceptible of repair. Soon, is Baha’u’llah’s prophetic view of our day, will the present-
day order be rolled up, and a new one spread out in its stead. Likewise, The signs of impending convulsions and
chaos can now be discerned, inasmuch as the prevailing order appears to be lamentably defective.

The current aim of religion, embodied in the aims and purposes of the Baha’i Faith, is the promotion of
the next stage in the organic process of human evolution -- the coming of age of the human race. The
achievement of this maturity will be attested by the unification of mankind and the federation of the world in a
single, all-embracing world society of human brotherhood. But great objectives are reached by dedicated
pursuit of the preliminary and intermediate stages of the task, without ever losing sight of the ultimate goal, and
this has been and is now the occupation of the Baha’i world community -- the completion within specified
times of specified goals. These teaching plans to which the Baha’is eagerly devote their lives do far more than
simply increase the size and consolidation of that world community. They are devised and launched by the head
of the Faith -- the Guardian and now the Universal House of Justice -- and are therefore conceived from a
global view, directed to the immediate needs of the great objective, conservative of the community’s resources,
world-wide in scale permitting the organic development of each part according to its stage of growth but with
due regard for the needs of the whole, fostering intensively the unity, the international co-operation, the
diversification of the ethnic, religious and social backgrounds of its increasing membership and developing new
resources for the next step forward.

It should be noted that none of these plans is isolated in aim or conception but all are directed towards
the implementation of three

\[5\] Habakkuk 2:14.

great charters, enshrined in Baha’i sacred Writings, which authorize and guide the expansion of the Faith and
the development of its institutions. In past Dispensations the command to ‘spread the Gospel’ has been general
and unspecified. It was the inspired guidance of the beloved Guardian of the Baha’i Faith which disclosed to a
spiritually delighted and grateful community yet another of the unique features of this Dispensation in the
specific guidance given in these three charters for the implementation of this eternal command.

Baha’u’llah’s Tablet of Carmel is the charter for the development of the Baha’i World Centre in the
twin cities of ‘Akka and Haifa, the site of its most sacred Shrines -- the tombs of the twin Prophets and of
‘Abdu’l-Baha, the Centre of the Covenant -- its monuments and gardens, and of its ‘world-shaking, world-
embracing, world-directing administrative institutions’.6

The Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Baha is the charter for the development of the administrative order
of the Faith. In this majestic document, the child of ‘that mystic intercourse between Him Who communicated
the generating influence of His divine Purpose and the One Who was its vehicle and chosen recipient,’7 are
delineated the structure of the administrative order, its modus operandi, its main institutions, the chain of
authority, the source of guidance and the position of every believer vis-a-vis the Covenant. It has been well
called the ‘Charter of the New World Order of Baha’u’llah’.

The Tablets of the Divine Plan, a series of fourteen letters written by ‘Abdu’l-Baha to the believers of
the United States and Canada, some addressed to the entire company of believers in the North American
continent and others to those in named geographical areas of that continent, constitute the charter for teaching
the Faith throughout the world. ‘Abdu’l-Baha names the places, the people to whom teachers must go, the
conditions under which they must travel and settle and He reveals several prayers for those who undertake this
all-important task.

All the international plans of the Faith launched so far have set specific goals aimed at implementing
these three charters and it is incontrovertibly apparent that never in any preceding Dispensation has the
command to spread the Word of God been given, in the sacred text, such explicit guidance and detailed
objectives.

As the Faith of Baha’u’llah increases in size and influence other aims and objectives become apparent
and possible of pursuit. The relationship with agencies, institutions and authorities of the non-Baha’i world
becomes an important consideration once the community emerges from obscurity, and has led to public
relations programmes and the development of closer association with the United Nations. The Baha’i
International Community is accredited as a non-governmental agency with consultative status to the United
Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and in various ways to other agencies of the United Nations.
The fostering of this relationship has been the goal of all international plans so far, and is visualized as a
continuing process. There are other objectives related to the special characteristics of Baha’i life which become
more and more important as the Faith grows and engages greater and greater public attention. They affect
Baha’i individuals, communities and institutions alike. These objectives fall into two groups -- those concerned
specifically with standards of conduct and those which relate to special Baha’i practices.

The standards of conduct enjoined by the Prophet are invariably different from and sometimes
diametrically opposed to the generally accepted ones of His day. High standards of conduct are, throughout
Baha’i scripture, constantly upheld and urged upon the believers, but the Guardian of the Faith in an essay
written in 1938 addressed to the believers in the United States and Canada laid great stress upon the ‘spiritual
prerequisites ... which constitute the bedrock on which ... all teaching plans ... must ultimately rest. ...’8 He
writes of ‘... a high sense of moral rectitude in their social and administrative activities, absolute chastity in
their individual lives, and complete freedom from prejudice in their dealings with peoples of a different race,
class, creed or colour.’9 In his expansion of this theme he declared that ‘This rectitude of conduct, with

\[8\] Shoghi Effendi, The Advent of Divine Justice.

\[9\] ibid.

its implications of justice, equity, truthfulness, honesty, fairmindedness, reliability, and trustworthiness, must
distinguish every phase of the life of the Baha’i community.’10 ‘A chaste and holy life must be made the
controlling principle in the behaviour and conduct of all Baha’is, both in their social relationships with the
members of their own community, and in their contacts with the world at large.’11 ‘It requires total abstinence
from all alcoholic drinks, from opium, and from similar habit-forming drugs. It condemns the prostitution of art
and of literature, the practices of nudism and of companionate marriage, infidelity in marital relationships, and
all manner of promiscuity, of easy familiarity, and of sexual vices.’12 ‘As to racial prejudice, the corrosion of
which, for well nigh a century, has bitten into the fibre, and attacked the whole social structure of American
society, it should be regarded as constituting the most vital and challenging issue confronting the Baha’i
community [of that country] at the present stage of its evolution.’13

The regeneration of men -- the first objective of religion mentioned in this essay -- is therefore seen as
the prime objective of the Baha’i Faith. Membership in the Faith is drawn from that society which permits and
indulges itself in all those corrupt, immoral and prejudiced activities which Baha’is are required to renounce,
and since the Faith is steadily but persistently growing in numbers there is reason to hope that slowly but surely
a regeneration will take place.

Further, these Baha’i standards of conduct are not for individuals alone. They must be the hallmark of
Baha’i institutions and communities. ‘Such a rectitude of conduct,’ wrote the Guardian, ‘must manifest itself,
with ever-increasing potency, in every verdict which the elected representatives of the Baha’i community, in
whatever capacity they may find themselves, may be called upon to pronounce. It must be constantly reflected
in the business dealings of all its members, in their domestic lives, in all manner of employment, and in any
service they may, in the future, render their government or people.’14 ‘It must be made the hallmark of that
numerically small, yet intensely dynamic and highly responsible body of the elected national representatives of
every Baha’i community, which constitutes the sustaining pillar, and the sole instrument for the election in
every community, of that Universal House whose very name and title, as ordained by Baha’u’llah, symbolizes
that rectitude of conduct which is its highest mission to safeguard and enforce.’15

The attitudes deriving from such standards, and from all the varied teachings of Baha’u’llah, must
pervade all Baha’i communities and imbue them with distinctive characteristics which can be recognized, amid
the welter of opposing or mutually uninterested groups and factions into which modern society is disintegrating,
as easily as the features of an individual in a crowd.

Those special Baha’i practices which will inevitably characterize the Baha’i community, are the
regular observances of its Holy Days and Festivals, the abstention from work on nine such days during the year,
the observances by all members of the community of the annual fast, of the laws governing marriage and
divorce, of daily prayer, of the invariable practice of consultation in all affairs of life, and particularly by the
regular observance of the Nineteen Day Feast. The habitual practice of such laws and ordinances is an objective
pursued by all Baha’is and Baha’i families.

It is seen that the aims and purposes of the Baha’i Faith may be stated as the raising up of a world-
wide community recruited from every race, nation, colour, religious and social background known on the
planet, inspired, united and regenerated by the spiritual teachings and love of Baha’u’llah, dedicated to the
building of that New World Order which ‘may well be regarded as the brightest emanation’16 of His mind and
is none other than the long hoped for, Christ-promised Kingdom of God on earth. To prepare men for the gifts
of that Kingdom -- peace, brotherhood, spirituality -- and to raise its very fabric in the world, are the immediate
and long-time objectives of the Baha’i Faith.

The energies of the Baha’is therefore, in pursuance of these aims, flow in three major channels:
individual spiritual development,

conveying the message of Baha’u’llah to others, and developing the pattern of world society embodied in the
Baha’i administrative order. All these activities derive from the sacred text and it is the unique feature of the
Baha’i revelation that whereas the first two are common to all revealed religions it is only Baha’u’llah Who
creates the institutions and reveals the laws, delineates the social order and establishes the principles of the
civilization to which His revelation will give rise. Neither Moses nor Christ, Muhammad, Buddha, Zoroaster or
Krishna did this, although They all foretold that it would be done by Him Who would take the government
upon His shoulders and establish the Kingdom in peace and righteousness.

None of the traditional motives operates to create the Baha’i community, neither former associations,
political or economic identity of interest, racial or patriotic grouping. Only the recognition and love of
Baha’u’llah brings into close relatedness and co-operative action people from every human background, of all
types of character and personality, divergent and diversified interest. Through their brotherhood in Baha’u’llah
the old crystallized forms of human divisiveness to which they formerly belonged, whether of class, race,
religion, occupation, temperament or degree of civilization lose their rigidity and eventually disintegrate. The
growing Baha’i community on the other hand is essentially based on love, is a brotherhood, a family, each
member delighting in the diversity of its membership, welcoming the former pariah or outcast as a new flower
in the garden, each as proud of his humanity as was ever the former chauvinist of his country.

Within such a community the sun of Baha’u’llah’s revelation can evoke new morals, new attitudes,
new conventions, new hopes and visions, all enshrined within the text of the revelation itself and which provide
the spiritual atmosphere and distinctive culture of the new day. Such a community, as it grows, becomes more
and more a true social order, providing a soil to human life, a climate for its best development, an arena for the
practice of its highest aspirations, and a beacon light to attract and guide the disillusioned, spiritually
impoverished, frenetic and frustrated peoples of the earth.

The energies of this new culture, guided and conserved to the service of human welfare by the
agencies of Baha’u’llah’s World Order will result in the proliferation of new arts and sciences, new social and
economic relationships, new educational methods and a general accession of well-being and felicity. The vision
of the Baha’i Faith, though glorious, is a practical one, and the number of its dedicated promoters grows with
increasing speed. It is summarized in the following words by the Guardian of the Baha’i Faith in his essay The
Unfoldment of World Civilization:

‘The unity of the human race, as envisaged by Baha’u’llah, implies the establishment of a world
commonwealth in which all nations, races, creeds and classes are closely and permanently united, and in which
the autonomy of its state members and the personal freedom and initiative of the individuals that compose them
are definitely and completely safeguarded. This commonwealth must, as far as we can visualize it, consist of a
world legislature, whose members will, as the trustees of the whole of mankind, ultimately control the entire
resources of all the component nations, and will enact such laws as shall be required to regulate the life, satisfy
the needs and adjust the relationships of all races and peoples. A world executive, backed by an international
Force, will carry out the decisions arrived at, and apply the laws enacted by, this world legislature, and will
safeguard the organic unity of the whole commonwealth. A world tribunal will adjudicate and deliver its
compulsory and final verdict in all and any disputes that may arise between the various elements constituting
this universal system. A mechanism of world inter-communication will be devised, embracing the whole planet,
freed from national hindrances and restrictions, and functioning with marvellous swiftness and perfect
regularity. A world metropolis will act as the nerve centre of a world civilization, the focus towards which the
unifying forces of life will converge and from which its energizing influences will radiate. A world language
will either be invented or chosen from among the existing languages and will be taught in the schools of all the
federated nations as an auxiliary to their mother tongue. A world script, a world literature, a uniform and
universal system of currency, of weights and measures, will simplify and facilitate intercourse and
understanding

among the nations and races of mankind. In such a world society, science and religion, the two most potent
forces in human life, will be reconciled, will co-operate, and will harmoniously develop. The press will, under
such a system, while giving full scope to the expression of the diversified views and convictions of mankind,
cease to be mischievously manipulated by vested interests, whether private or public, and will be liberated from
the influence of contending governments and peoples. The economic resources of the world will be organized,
its sources of raw materials will be tapped and fully utilized, its markets will be co-ordinated and developed,
and the distribution of its products will be equitably regulated.

‘National rivalries, hatred, and intrigues will cease, and racial animosity and prejudice will be replaced
by racial amity, understanding and co-operation. The causes of religious strife will be permanently removed,
economic barriers and restrictions will be completely abolished, and the inordinate distinction between classes
will be obliterated. Destitution on the one hand, and gross accumulation of ownership on the other, will
disappear. The enormous energy dissipated and wasted on war, whether economic or political, will be
consecrated to such ends as will extend the range of human inventions and technical development, to the
increase of the productivity of mankind, to the extermination of disease, to the extension of scientific research,
to the raising of the standard of physical health, to the sharpening and refinement of the human brain, to the
exploitation of the unused and unsuspected resources of the planet, to the prolongation of human life, and to the
furtherance of any other agency that can stimulate the intellectual, the moral, and spiritual life of the entire
human race.

‘A world federal system, ruling the whole earth and exercising unchallengeable authority over its
unimaginably vast resources, blending and embodying the ideals of both the East and the West, liberated from
the curse of war and its miseries, and bent on the exploitation of all the available sources of energy on the
surface of the planet, a system in which Force is made the servant of Justice, whose life is sustained by its
universal recognition of one God and by its allegiance to one common Revelation -- such is the goal towards
which humanity, impelled by the unifying forces of life, is moving.’

EXCERPTS FROM THE BAHA’I SACRED WRITINGS

1. B A H A ’ U ’ L L A H
Excerpts from Tablets of Baha’u’llah revealed after the Kitab-i-Aqdas17
A L L glory be to this Day, the Day in which the fragrances of mercy have been wafted over all created
things, a Day so blest that past ages and centuries can never hope to rival it, a Day in which the countenance of
the Ancient of Days hath turned towards His holy seat. Thereupon the voices of all created things, and beyond
them those of the Concourse on High, were heard calling aloud: ‘Haste thee, O Carmel, for lo, the light of the
countenance of God, the Ruler of the Kingdom of Names and Fashioner of the heavens, hath been lifted upon
thee.’

Seized with transports of joy, and raising high her voice, she thus exclaimed: ‘May my life be a
sacrifice to Thee, inasmuch as Thou hast fixed Thy gaze upon me, hast bestowed upon me Thy bounty, and hast
directed towards me Thy steps. Separation from Thee, O Thou Source of everlasting life, hath well nigh
consumed me, and my remoteness from Thy presence hath burned away my soul. All praise be to Thee for
having enabled me to hearken to Thy call, for having honoured me with Thy footsteps, and for having
quickened my soul through the vitalizing fragrance of Thy Day and the shrilling voice of Thy Pen, a voice Thou
didst ordain as Thy trumpet-call amidst Thy people. And when the hour at which Thy resistless Faith was to be
made manifest did strike, Thou didst breathe a breath of Thy spirit into Thy Pen, and lo, the entire creation
shook to its very foundations, unveiling to mankind such mysteries as lay hidden within the treasuries of Him
Who is the Possessor of all created things.’

No sooner had her voice reached that most exalted Spot than We made reply: ‘Render thanks unto Thy
Lord, O Carmel. The fire of thy separation from Me was fast consuming thee, when the ocean of My presence
surged before thy face, cheering thine eyes and those of all creation, and filling with delight all things visible
and invisible. Rejoice, for God hath in this Day established upon thee His throne, hath made thee the dawning-
place of His signs and the day spring of the evidences of His Revelation. Well is it with him that circleth around
thee, that proclaimeth the revelation of thy glory, and recounteth that which the bounty of the Lord thy God
hath showered upon thee. Seize thou the Chalice of Immortality in the name of thy Lord, the All-Glorious, and
give thanks unto Him, inasmuch as He, in token of His mercy unto thee, hath turned thy sorrow into gladness,
and transmuted thy grief into blissful joy. He, verily, loveth the spot which had been made the seat of His
throne, which His footsteps have trodden, which hath been honoured by His presence, from which He raised
His call, and upon which He shed His tears.

‘Call out to Zion, O Carmel, and announce the joyful tidings: He that was hidden from mortal eyes is
come! His all-conquering sovereignty is manifest; His all-encompassing splendour is revealed. Beware lest thou
hesitate or halt. Hasten forth and circumambulate the City of God that hath descended from heaven, the
celestial Kaaba round which have circled in adoration the favoured of God, the pure in heart, and the company
of the most exalted angels. Oh, how I long to announce unto every spot on the surface of the earth, and to carry
to each one of its cities, the glad-tidings

of this Revelation -- a Revelation to which the heart of Sinai hath been attracted, and in whose name the
Burning Bush is calling: “Unto God, the Lord of Lords, belong the kingdoms of earth and heaven.” Verily this
is the Day in which both land and sea rejoice at this announcement, the Day for which have been laid up those
things which God, through a bounty beyond the ken of mortal mind or heart, hath destined for revelation. Ere
long will God sail His Ark upon thee, and will manifest the people of Baha who have been mentioned in the
Book of Names.’

Sanctified be the Lord of all mankind, at the mention of Whose name all the atoms of the earth have
been made to vibrate, and the Tongue of Grandeur hath been moved to disclose that which had been wrapt in
His knowledge and lay concealed within the treasury of His might. He, verily, through the potency of His name,
the Mighty, the All-Powerful, the Most High, is the ruler of all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth.

In former religions such ordinances as holy war, destruction of books, the ban on association and
companionship with other peoples or on reading certain books had been laid down and affirmed according to
the exigencies of the time; however, in this mighty Revelation, in this momentous Announcement, the manifold
bestowals and favours of God have overshadowed all men, and from the horizon of the Will of the Ever-
Abiding Lord, His infallible decree hath prescribed that which We have set forth. ...

We yield praise unto God -- hallowed and glorified be He -- for whatsoever He hath graciously
revealed in this blessed, this glorious and incomparable Day. Indeed if everyone on earth were endowed with a
myriad tongues and were to continually praise God and magnify His Name to the end that knoweth no end,
their thanksgiving would not prove adequate for even one of the gracious favours We have mentioned in this
Tablet. Unto this beareth witness every man of wisdom and discernment, of understanding and knowledge.

We earnestly beseech God -- exalted be His glory -- to aid the rulers and sovereigns, who are the
exponents of power and the daysprings of glory, to enforce His laws and ordinances. He is in truth the
Omnipotent, the All-Powerful, He Who is wont to answer the call of men.

Praise and glory beseem the Lord of Names and the Creator of the heavens, He, the waves of Whose
ocean of Revelation surge before the eyes of the peoples of the world. The Day-Star of His Cause shineth
through every veil and His Word of affirmation standeth beyond the reach of negation. Neither the ascendancy
of the oppressor nor the tyranny of the wicked hath been able to thwart His Purpose. How glorified is His
sovereignty, how exalted His dominion!

Great God! Although His signs have encompassed the world and His proofs and testimonies are
shining forth and manifest as the light, yet the ignorant appear heedless, nay rather, rebellious. Would that they
had been content with opposition. But at all times they are plotting to cut down the sacred Lote-Tree. Since the
dawn of this Revelation the embodiments of selfishness have, by resorting to cruelty and oppression, striven to
extinguish the Light of divine manifestation. But God, having stayed their hands, revealed this Light through
His sovereign authority and protected it through the power of His might until earth and heaven were illumined
by its radiance and brightness. Praise be unto Him under all conditions.

Glory be unto Thee, O Lord of the world and Desire of the nations, O Thou Who hast become manifest
in the Greatest Name whereby the pearls of wisdom and utterance have appeared from the shells of the great
sea of Thy knowledge, and the heavens of divine revelation have been adorned with the light of the appearance
of the Sun of Thy countenance.

I beg of Thee, by that Word through which Thy proof was perfected among Thy creatures and Thy
testimony was fulfilled among Thy servants to strengthen Thy people in that whereby the face of the Cause will
radiate in Thy dominion, the standards of Thy power will be planted among Thy servants, and the banners of
Thy guidance will be raised throughout Thy dominions.

O my Lord! Thou beholdest them clinging to the rope of Thy grace and holding fast unto the hem of
the mantle of Thy beneficence. Ordain for them that which may draw them nearer unto Thee, and withhold
them from all else save Thee. I beg of Thee, O Thou King of existence and Protector of the seen and the
unseen, to make whosoever ariseth to serve Thy Cause as a sea moving by Thy desire, as one ablaze with the
fire of Thy Sacred Tree, shining from the horizon of the heaven of Thy will. Verily Thou art the mighty One
Whom neither the power of all the world nor the strength of nations can weaken. There is no God but Thee, the
One, the Incomparable, the Protector, the Self-Subsistent.

They that are endued with sincerity and faithfulness should associate with all the peoples and kindreds
of the earth with joy and radiance, inasmuch as consorting with people hath promoted and will continue to
promote unity and concord, which in turn are conducive to the maintenance of order in the world and to the
regeneration of nations. Blessed are such as hold fast to the cord of kindliness and tender mercy and are free
from animosity and hatred.

This Wronged One exhorteth the peoples of the world to observe tolerance and righteousness, which
are two lights amidst the darkness of the world and two educators for the edification of mankind. Happy are
they who have attained thereto and woe betide the heedless.

A good character is, verily, the best mantle for men from God. With it He adorneth the temples of His
loved ones. By My life! The light of a good character surpasseth the light of the sun and the radiance thereof.
Whoso attaineth unto it is accounted as a jewel among men. The glory and the upliftment of the world must
needs depend upon it. A goodly character is a means whereby men are guided to the Straight Path and are led to
the Great Announcement. Well is it with him who is adorned with the saintly attributes and character of the
Concourse on High.

It beseemeth you to fix your gaze under all conditions upon justice and fairness. In the Hidden Words
this exalted utterance hath been revealed from Our Most August Pen: ‘O Son of Spirit! The best beloved of all
things in My sight is Justice; turn not away therefrom if thou desirest Me, and neglect it not that I may confide
in thee. By its aid thou shalt see with thine own eyes and not through the eyes of others, and shalt know of thine
own knowledge and not through the knowledge of thy neighbour. Ponder this in thy heart; how it behoveth thee
to be. Verily justice is My gift to thee and the sign of My loving kindness. Set it then before thine eyes.’

They that are just and fair-minded in their judgement occupy a sublime station and hold an exalted
rank. The light of piety and uprightness shineth resplendent from these souls. We earnestly hope that the
peoples and countries of the world may not be deprived of the splendours of these two luminaries.

God testifieth that there is none other God but Him and that He Who hath appeared is the Hidden
Mystery, the Treasured Symbol, the Most Great Book for all peoples, and the Heaven of bounty for the whole
world. He is the Most Mighty Sign amongst men and the Dayspring of the most august attributes in the realm of
creation. Through Him hath appeared that which had been hidden from time immemorial and been veiled from
the eyes of men. He is the One Whose Manifestation was announced by the heavenly Scriptures, in former
times and more recently. Whoso acknowledgeth belief in Him and in His signs and testimonies hath in truth
acknowledged that which the Tongue of Grandeur uttered ere the creation of earth and heaven and the
revelation of the Kingdom of Names. Through Him the ocean of knowledge hath surged amidst mankind and
the river of divine wisdom hath gushed out at the behest of God, the Lord of Days.

Well is it with the man of discernment who hath recognized and perceived the Truth, and the one
possessed of a hearing ear who hath hearkened unto His sweet Voice, and the hand that hath received His Book
with such resolve

as is born of God, the Lord of this world and of the next, and the earnest wayfarer who hath hastened unto His
glorious Horizon, and the one endued with strength whom neither the overpowering might of the rulers, nor the
tumult raised by the leaders of religion hath been able to shake. And woe betide him who hath rejected the
grace of God and His bounty, and hath denied His tender mercy and authority; such a man is indeed reckoned
with those who have throughout eternity repudiated the testimony of God and His proof.

Great is the blessedness of him who hath in this Day cast away the things current amongst men and
hath clung unto that which is ordained by God, the Lord of Names and the Fashioner of all created things, He
Who is come from the heaven of eternity through the power of the Most Great Name, invested with so
invincible an authority that all the powers of the earth are unable to withstand Him. Unto this beareth witness
the Mother Book, calling from the Most Sublime Station.

Above all else, the greatest gift and the most wondrous blessing hath ever been and will continue to be
wisdom. It is man’s unfailing protector. It aideth him and strengtheneth him. Wisdom is God’s emissary and the
revealer of His Name the Omniscient. Through it the loftiness of man’s station is made manifest and evident. It
is all-knowing and the foremost teacher in the school of existence. It is the guide and is invested with high
distinction. Thanks to its educating influence earthly beings have become imbued with a gem-like spirit which
outshineth the heavens. In the city of justice it is the unrivalled Speaker Who, in the year nine, illumined the
world with the joyful tidings of this Revelation. And it was this peerless Source of wisdom that at the beginning
of the foundation of the world ascended the stair of inner meaning and when enthroned upon the pulpit of
utterance, through the operation of the divine Will, proclaimed two words. The first heralded the promise of
reward, while the second voiced the ominous warning of punishment. The promise gave rise to hope and the
warning begat fear. Thus the basis of world order hath been firmly established upon these twin principles.
Exalted is the Lord of Wisdom, the Possessor of Great Bounty.

The light of men is justice. Quench it not with the contrary winds of oppression and tyranny. The
purpose of justice is the appearance of unity among men. The ocean of divine wisdom surgeth within this
exalted word, while the books of the world cannot contain its inner significance. Were mankind to be adorned
with this raiment, they would behold the day-star of the utterance, ‘On that day God will satisfy everyone out of
His abundance,’18 shining resplendent above the horizon of the world. Appreciate ye the value of this utterance;
it is a noble fruit that the Tree of the Pen of Glory hath yielded. Happy is the man that giveth ear unto it and
observeth its precepts. Verily I say, whatever is sent down from the heaven of the Will of God is the means for
the establishment of order in the world and the instrument for promoting unity and fellowship among its
peoples. Thus hath the Tongue of this Wronged One spoken from His Most Great Prison.

O ye men of wisdom among nations! Shut your eyes to estrangement, then fix your gaze upon unity.

Cleave tenaciously unto that which will lead to the wellbeing and tranquillity of all mankind. This span of earth
is but one homeland and one habitation. It behoveth you to abandon vainglory which causeth alienation and to
set your hearts on whatever will ensure harmony. In the estimation of the people of Baha man’s glory lieth in
his knowledge, his upright conduct, his praiseworthy character, his wisdom, and not in his nationality or rank.
O people of the earth! Appreciate the value of this heavenly word. Indeed it may be likened unto a ship for the
ocean of knowledge and a shining luminary for the realm of perception.

In all matters moderation is desirable. If a thing is carried to excess, it will prove a source of evil.

Consider the civilization of the West,

\[18\] cf. Qur’an 4:129.

how it hath agitated and alarmed the peoples of the world. An infernal engine hath been devised, and hath
proved so cruel a weapon of destruction that its like none hath ever witnessed or heard. The purging of such
deeply-rooted and overwhelming corruptions cannot be effected unless the peoples of the world unite in pursuit
of one common aim and embrace one universal faith. Incline your ears unto the Call of this Wronged One and
adhere firmly to the Lesser Peace.

Strange and astonishing things exist in the earth but they are hidden from the minds and the
understanding of men. These things are capable of changing the whole atmosphere of the earth and their
contamination would prove lethal. Great God! We have observed an amazing thing. Lightning or a force similar
to it is controlled by an operator and moveth at his command. Immeasurably exalted is the Lord of Power Who
hath laid bare that which He purposed through the potency of His weighty and invincible command.

We enjoin upon them that are the emblems of His names and attributes to firmly adhere henceforth
unto that which hath been set forth in this Most Great Revelation, not to allow themselves to become the cause
of strife, and, until the end that knoweth no end, to keep their eyes directed towards the day spring of these
resplendent words which have been recorded in this Tablet. Strife leads to bloodshed and provokes commotion
amongst people. Hearken ye unto the Voice of this Wronged One and deviate not therefrom.

Were anyone to ponder in his heart that which hath, in this Revelation, streamed forth from the Pen of
Glory, he would be assured that whatever this Wronged One hath affirmed He hath had no intention of
establishing any position or distinction for Himself. The purpose hath rather been to attract the souls, through
the sublimity of His words, unto the summit of transcendent glory and to endow them with the capacity of
perceiving that which will purge and purify the peoples of the world from the strife and dissension which
religious differences provoke. Unto this bear witness My heart, My Pen, My inner and My outer Being. God
grant that all men may turn unto the treasuries latent within their own beings.

Justice is in this day bewailing its plight, and Equity groaneth beneath the yoke of oppression. The
thick clouds of tyranny have darkened the face of the earth, and enveloped its peoples. Through the movement
of Our Pen of glory We have, at the bidding of the omnipotent Ordainer, breathed a new life into every human
frame, and instilled into every word a fresh potency. All created things proclaim the evidences of this world-
wide regeneration. This is the most great, the most joyful tidings imparted by the Pen of this Wronged One to
mankind. Wherefore fear ye, O My well-beloved ones? Who is it that can dismay you? A touch of moisture
sufficeth to dissolve the hardened clay out of which this perverse generation is moulded. The mere act of your
gathering together is enough to scatter the forces of these vain and worthless people.

Strife and conflict befit the beasts of the wild. It was through the grace of God and with the aid of
seemly words and praiseworthy deeds that the unsheathed swords of the Babi community were returned to their
scabbards. Indeed through the power of good words, the righteous have always succeeded in winning command
over the meads of the hearts of men. Say, O ye loved ones! Do not forsake prudence. Incline your hearts to the
counsels given by the Most Exalted Pen and beware lest your hands or tongues cause harm unto anyone among
mankind.

It is incumbent upon every man, in this Day, to hold fast unto whatsoever will promote the interests,
and exalt the station, of all nations and just governments. Through each and every one of the verses which the
Pen of the Most High hath revealed, the doors of love and unity have been unlocked and flung open to the face
of men. We have erewhile declared -- and Our Word is the truth -- : ‘Consort with the followers of all religions
in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship.’ Whatsoever hath led the children

of men to shun one another, and hath caused dissensions and divisions amongst them, hath, through the
revelation of these words, been nullified and abolished. From the heaven of God’s Will, and for the purpose of
ennobling the world of being and of elevating the minds and souls of men, hath been sent down that which is
the most effective instrument for the education of the whole human race. The highest essence and most perfect
expression of whatsoever the peoples of old have either said or written hath, through this most potent
Revelation, been sent down from the heaven of the Will of the All-Possessing, the Ever-Abiding God. Of old it
hath been revealed: ‘Love of one’s country is an element of the Faith of God.’ The Tongue of Grandeur hath,
however, in the day of His manifestation proclaimed: ‘It is not his to boast who loveth his country, but it is his
who loveth the world.’ Through the power released by these exalted words He hath lent a fresh impulse and set
a new direction to the birds of men’s hearts, and hath obliterated every trace of restriction and limitation from
God’s holy Book.

This Wronged One hath forbidden the people of God to engage in contention or conflict and hath
exhorted them to righteous deeds and praiseworthy character. In this day the hosts that can ensure the victory of
the Cause are those of goodly conduct and saintly character. Blessed are they who firmly adhere unto them and
woe betide such as turn away therefrom.

O people of God! I admonish you to observe courtesy. For above all else it is the prince of virtues.

Well is it with him who is illumined with the light of courtesy and is attired with the vesture of uprightness.
Whoso is endued with courtesy hath indeed attained a sublime station. It is hoped that this Wronged One and
everyone else may be enabled to acquire it, hold fast unto it, observe it, and fix our gaze upon it. This is a
binding command which hath streamed forth from the Pen of the Most Great Name.

This is the day when the gems of constancy that lie hid in the mine of men’s inner selves should be
made manifest. O people of Justice! Be as brilliant as the light and as splendid as the fire that blazed in the
Burning Bush. The brightness of the fire of your love will no doubt fuse and unify the contending peoples and
kindreds of the earth, whilst the fierceness of the flame of enmity and hatred cannot but result in strife and ruin.
We beseech God that He may shield His creatures from the evil designs of His enemies. He verily hath power
over all things.

All praise be to the one true God -- exalted be His glory -- inasmuch as He hath, through the Pen of the
Most High, unlocked the doors of men’s hearts. Every verse which this Pen hath revealed is a bright and
shining portal that discloseth the glories of a saintly and pious life, of pure and stainless deeds. The summons
and the message which We gave were never intended to reach one land or one people only. Mankind in its
entirety must firmly adhere to whatsoever hath been revealed and vouchsafed unto it. Then and only then will it
attain unto true liberty. The whole earth is illuminated with the resplendent glory of God’s Revelation. In the
year sixty He Who heralded the light of Divine Guidance -- may all creation be sacrificed unto Him -- arose to
announce a fresh revelation of the Divine Spirit and was followed, twenty years later, by Him through Whose
coming the world was made the recipient of this promised glory, this wondrous favour. Behold how the
generality of mankind hath been endued with the capacity to hearken unto God’s most exalted Word -- the
Word upon which must depend the gathering together and spiritual resurrection of all men.

Incline your hearts, O people of God, unto the counsels of your true, your incomparable Friend. The
Word of God may be likened unto a sapling, whose roots have been implanted in the hearts of men. It is
incumbent upon you to foster its growth through the living waters of wisdom, of sanctified and holy words, so
that its root may become firmly fixed and its branches may spread out as high as the heavens and beyond.

O ye that dwell on earth! The distinguishing feature that marketh the pre-eminent character of this
Supreme Revelation consisteth in that We have, on the one hand, blotted out from the pages of God’s holy
Book whatsoever

hath been the cause of strife, of malice and mischief amongst the children of men, and have, on the other, laid
down the essential prerequisites of concord, of understanding, of complete and enduring unity. Well is it with
them that keep My statutes.

Time and again We have admonished Our beloved ones to avoid, nay to flee from, anything
whatsoever from which the odour of mischief can be detected. The world is in great turmoil, and the minds of
its people are in a state of utter confusion. We entreat the Almighty that He may graciously illuminate them
with the glory of His justice, and enable them to discover that which will be profitable unto them at all times
and under all conditions. He, verily is the All-Possessing, the Most High.

O thou who hast fixed thy gaze upon the Dawning-Place of the Cause of God! Know thou for a
certainty that the Will of God is not limited by the standards of the people, and God doth not tread in their
ways. Rather is it incumbent upon everyone to firmly adhere to God’s straight Path. Were He to pronounce the
right to be the left or the south to be the north, He speaketh the truth and there is no doubt of it. Verily He is to
be praised in His acts and to be obeyed in His behests. He hath no associate in His judgement nor any helper in
His sovereignty. He doeth whatsoever He willeth and ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth. Know thou moreover
that all else besides Him have been created through the potency of a word from His presence, while of
themselves they have no motion nor stillness, except at His bidding and by His leave.

O thou who soarest in the atmosphere of love and fellowship and hast fixed thy gaze upon the light of
the countenance of thy Lord, the King of creation! Render thanks unto God, inasmuch as He hath unravelled for
thee that which was hidden and enshrined in His knowledge so that everyone may become aware that within
His realm of supreme infallibility He hath not taken a partner nor a counsellor unto Himself. He is in truth the
Dayspring of divine precepts and commandments and the Fountainhead of knowledge and wisdom, while all
else besides Him are but His subjects and under His rule, and He is the supreme Ruler, the Ordainer, the All-
Knowing, the All-Informed.

We have enjoined upon all mankind to establish the Lesser Peace -- the surest of all means for the
protection of humanity. The sovereigns of the world should, with one accord, hold fast thereunto, for this is the
supreme instrument that can ensure the security and welfare of all peoples and nations. They, verily, are the
manifestations of the power of God and the daysprings of His authority. We beseech the Almighty that He may
graciously assist them in that which is conducive to the well-being of their subjects. A full explanation
regarding this matter hath been previously set forth by the Pen of Glory; well is it with them that act
accordingly.

It is incumbent upon everyone to observe God’s holy commandments, inasmuch as they are the
wellspring of life unto the world. The heaven of divine wisdom is illumined with the two luminaries of
consultation and compassion and the canopy of world order is upraised upon the two pillars of reward and
punishment.

In this Revelation the hosts that can render it victorious are the hosts of praiseworthy deeds and upright
character. The leader and commander of these hosts hath ever been the fear of God, a fear that encompasseth all
things and reigneth over all things.

O peoples of the world! Forsake all evil, hold fast that which is good. Strive to be shining examples
unto all mankind, and true reminders of the virtues of God amidst men. He that riseth to serve My Cause should
manifest My wisdom, and bend every effort to banish ignorance from the earth. Be united in counsel, be

one in thought. Let each morn be better than its eve and each morrow richer than its yesterday. Man’s merit
lieth in service and virtue and not in the pageantry of wealth and riches. Take heed that your words be purged
from idle fancies and worldly desires and your deeds be cleansed from craftiness and suspicion. Dissipate not
the wealth of your precious lives in the pursuit of evil and corrupt affection, nor let your endeavours be spent in
promoting your personal interest. Be generous in your days of plenty, and be patient in the hour of loss.
Adversity is followed by success and rejoicings follow woe. Guard against idleness and sloth, and cling unto
that which profiteth mankind, whether young or old, whether high or low. Beware lest ye sow tares of
dissension among men or plant thorns of doubt in pure and radiant hearts.

O ye beloved of the Lord! Commit not that which defileth the limpid steam of love or destroyeth the
sweet fragrance of friendship. By the righteousness of the Lord! Ye were created to show love one to another
and not perversity and rancour. Take pride not in love for yourselves but in love for your fellow-creatures.
Glory not in love for your country but in love for all mankind. Let your eye be chaste, your hand faithful, your
tongue truthful and your heart enlightened. Abase not the station of the learned in Baha and belittle not the rank
of such rulers as administer justice amidst you. Set your reliance on the army of justice, put on the armour of
wisdom, let your adorning be forgiveness and mercy and that which cheereth the hearts of the well-favoured of
God.

The source of all good is trust in God, submission unto His command, and contentment with His holy
will and pleasure.

The essence of wisdom is the fear of God, the dread of His scourge and punishment, and the
apprehension of His justice and decree.

The essence of religion is to testify unto that which the Lord hath revealed, and follow that which He
hath ordained in His mighty Book.

The source of all glory is acceptance of whatsoever the Lord hath bestowed, and contentment with that
which God hath ordained.

The essence of love is for man to turn his heart to the Beloved One, and sever himself from all else but
Him, and desire naught save that which is the desire of his Lord.

> True remembrance is to make mention of the Lord, the All-Praised, and forget aught else beside Him.

True reliance is for the servant to pursue his profession and calling in this world, to hold fast unto the
Lord, to seek naught but His grace, inasmuch as in His Hands is the destiny of a l l His servants.

The essence of detachment is for man to turn his face towards the courts of the Lord, to enter His
Presence, behold His Countenance, and stand as witness before Him.

The essence of understanding is to testify to one’s poverty, and submit to the Will of the Lord, the
Sovereign, the Gracious, the All-Powerful.

The source of courage and power is the promotion of the Word of God, and steadfastness in His love.
The essence of charity is for the servant to recount the blessings of His Lord, and to render thanks unto
Him at all times and under a l l conditions.

The essence of faith is fewness of words and abundance of deeds; he whose words exceed his deeds,
know verily his death is better than his life.

The essence of true safety is to observe silence, to look at the end of things and to renounce the world.
The beginning of magnanimity is when man expendeth his wealth on himself, on his family and on the
poor among his brethren in his Faith.

The essence of wealth is love for Me; whoso loveth Me is the possessor of all things, and he that
loveth Me not is indeed of the poor and needy. This is that which the Finger of Glory and Splendour hath
revealed.

The source of all evil is for man to turn away from his Lord and set his heart on things ungodly.
The most burning fire is to question the signs of God, to dispute idly that which He hath revealed, to
deny Him and carry one’s self proudly before Him.

The source of all learning is the knowledge of God, exalted be His Glory, and this cannot be attained
save through the knowledge of His Divine Manifestation.

The essence of abasement is to pass out from under the shadow of the Merciful and seek the shelter of
the Evil One.

The source of error is to disbelieve in the One true God, rely upon aught else but Him, and flee from
His Decree.

True loss is for him whose days have been spent in utter ignorance of his self.
The essence of all that We have revealed for thee is Justice, is for man to free himself from idle fancy
and imitation, discern with the eye of oneness His glorious handiwork, and look into all things with a searching
eye.

Thus have We instructed thee, manifested unto thee Words of Wisdom, that thou mayest be thankful
unto the Lord, thy God, and glory therein amidst all peoples.

Man is the supreme Talisman. Lack of a proper education hath, however, deprived him of that which
he doth inherently possess. Through a word proceeding out of the mouth of God he was called into being; by
one word more he was guided to recognize the Source of his education; by yet another word his station and
destiny were safeguarded. The Great Being saith: Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value.
Education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to benefit therefrom. If any man were
to meditate on that which the Scriptures, sent down from the heaven of God’s holy Will, have revealed, he
would readily recognize that their purpose is that all men shall be regarded as one soul, so that the seal bearing
the words ‘The Kingdom shall be God’s’ may be stamped on every heart, and the light of Divine bounty, of
grace, and mercy may envelop all mankind. The One true God, exalted be His glory, hath wished nothing for
Himself. The allegiance of mankind profiteth Him not, neither doth its perversity harm Him. The Bird of the
Realm of Utterance voiceth continually this call: ‘All things have I willed for thee, and thee, too, for thine own
sake.’ If the learned and worldly-wise men of this age were to allow mankind to inhale the fragrance of
fellowship and love, every understanding heart would apprehend the meaning of true liberty, and discover the
secret of undisturbed peace and absolute composure. Were the earth to attain this station and be illumined with
its light it could then be truly said of it: ‘Thou shall see in it no hollows or rising hills.’19

The Great Being, wishing to reveal the prerequisites of the peace and tranquillity of the world and the
advancement of its peoples, hath written: The time must come when the imperative necessity for the holding of
a vast, an all-embracing assemblage of men will be universally realized. The rulers and kings of the earth must
needs attend it, and, participating in its deliberations, must consider such ways and means as will lay the
foundations of the world’s Great Peace amongst men. Such a peace demandeth that the Great Powers should
resolve, for the sake of the tranquillity of the peoples of the earth, to be fully reconciled among themselves.
Should any king take up arms against another, all should unitedly arise and prevent him. If this be done, the
nations of the world will no longer require any armaments, except for the purpose of preserving the security of
their realms and of maintaining internal order within their territories. This will ensure the peace and composure
of every people, government and nation. We fain would hope that the kings and rulers of the earth, the mirrors
of the gracious and almighty name of God, may attain unto this station, and shield mankind from the onslaught
of tyranny.

The Great Being saith: The man of consummate learning and the sage endowed with penetrating
wisdom are the two eyes to the body of mankind. God willing, the earth shall never be deprived of these two
greatest gifts. That which hath been set forth and will be revealed in the future is but a token of this Servant’s
ardent desire to dedicate Himself to the service of all the kindreds of the earth.

O my friend! In all circumstances one should seize upon every means which will promote security and
tranquillity among the peoples of

\[19\] Qur’an 20:106.
--- The Mansion of Bahji where Baha’u’llah spent the last twelve years of His life. Here the distinguished
orientalist, Prof. E.G. Browne of Cambridge, was granted his four successive interviews with Baha’u’llah,
during the five days he was His guest; 15-20 April 1890. ---

the world. The Great Being saith: In this glorious Day whatever will purge you from corruption and will lead
you towards peace and composure, is indeed the Straight Path.

Please God, the peoples of the world may be led, as the result of the high endeavours exerted by their
rulers and the wise and learned amongst men, to recognize their best interests. How long will humanity persist
in its waywardness? How long will injustice continue? How long is chaos and confusion to reign amongst men?
How long will discord agitate the face of society?

This humble servant is filled with wonder, inasmuch as all men are endowed with the capacity to see
and hear, yet we find them deprived of the privilege of using these faculties. This servant hath been prompted to
pen these lines by virtue of the tender love he cherisheth for thee. The winds of despair are, alas, blowing from
every direction, and the strife that divideth and afflicteth the human race is daily increasing. The signs of
impending convulsions and chaos can now be discerned, inasmuch as the prevailing order appeareth to be
lamentably defective. I beseech God. exalted be His glory, that He may graciously awaken the peoples of the
earth, may grant that the end of their conduct may be profitable unto them, and aid them to accomplish that
which beseemeth their station.

Were man to appreciate the greatness of his station and the loftiness of his destiny he would manifest
naught save goodly character, pure deeds, and a seemly and praiseworthy conduct. If the learned and wise men
of goodwill were to impart guidance unto the people, the whole earth would be regarded as one country. Verily
this is the undoubted truth. This servant appealeth to every diligent and enterprising soul to exert his utmost
endeavour and arise to rehabilitate the conditions in all regions and to quicken the dead with the living waters
of wisdom and utterance, by virtue of the love he cherisheth for God, the One, the Peerless, the Almighty, the
Beneficent.

No man of wisdom can demonstrate his knowledge save by means of words. This showeth the
significance of the Word as is affirmed in all the Scriptures, whether of former times or more recently. For it is
through its potency and animating spirit that the people of the world have attained so eminent a position.
Moreover words and utterances should be both impressive and penetrating. However, no word will be infused
with these two qualities unless it be uttered wholly for the sake of God and with due regard unto the exigencies
of the occasion and the people.

The Great Being saith: Human utterance is an essence which aspireth to exert its influence and needeth
moderation. As to its influence, this is conditional upon refinement which in turn is dependent upon hearts
which are detached and pure. As to its moderation, this hath to be combined with tact and wisdom as prescribed
in the Holy Scriptures and Tablets.

Every word is endowed with a spirit, therefore the speaker or expounder should carefully deliver his
words at the appropriate time and place, for the impression which each word maketh is clearly evident and
perceptible. The Great Being saith: One word may be likened unto fire, another unto light, and the influence
which both exert is manifest in the world. Therefore an enlightened man of wisdom should primarily speak with
words as mild as milk, that the children of men may be nurtured and edified thereby and may attain the ultimate
goal of human existence which is the station of true understanding and nobility. And likewise He saith: One
word is like unto springtime causing the tender saplings of the rose-garden of knowledge to become verdant
and flourishing, while another word is even as a deadly poison. It behoveth a prudent man of wisdom to speak
with utmost leniency and forbearance so that the sweetness of his words may induce everyone to attain that
which befitteth man’s station.

O friend of mine! The Word of God is the king of words and its pervasive influence is incalculable. It
hath ever dominated and will continue to dominate the realm of being. The Great Being saith: The Word is the
master key for the whole world, inasmuch as through its potency the doors of the hearts of men, which in reality
are the doors of heaven, are unlocked. No sooner had but a glimmer of its effulgent splendour shone forth upon
the mirror of love than the blessed word ‘I am the Best-Beloved’ was reflected therein. It is an ocean
inexhaustible in riches, comprehending all things. Every thing which can be perceived is but an emanation
therefrom. High, immeasurably high is this sublime station, in whose shadow moveth the essence of loftiness
and splendour, wrapt in praise and adoration.

Methinks people’s sense of taste hath, alas been sorely affected by the fever of negligence and folly,
for they are found to be wholly unconscious and deprived of the sweetness of His utterance. How regrettable
indeed, that man should debar himself from the fruits of the tree of wisdom while his days and hours pass
swiftly away. Please God, the hand of divine power may safeguard all mankind and direct their steps towards
the horizon of true understanding.

Verily our Lord of Mercy is the Helper, the Knowing, the Wise.
Although the Realm of Glory hath none of the vanities of the world, yet within the treasury of trust and
resignation We have bequeathed to Our heirs an excellent and priceless heritage. Earthly treasures We have not
bequeathed, nor have We added such cares as they entail. By God! In earthly riches fear is hidden and peril is
concealed. Consider ye and call to mind that which the All-Merciful hath revealed in the Qur’an: ‘Woe betide
every slanderer and defamer, him that layeth up riches and counteth them.’20 Fleeting are the riches of the
world; all that perisheth and changeth is not, and hath never been, worthy of attention, except to a recognized
measure.

The aim of this Wronged One in sustaining woes and tribulations, in revealing the Holy Verses and in
demonstrating proofs hath been naught but to quench the flame of hate and enmity, that the horizon of the
hearts of men may be illumined with the light of concord and attain real peace and tranquillity. From the
dawning-place of the divine Tablet the day-star of this utterance shineth resplendent, and it behoveth everyone
to fix his gaze upon it: We exhort you, O peoples of the world, to observe

\[20\] Qur’an 104:1-2.

that which will elevate your station. Hold fast to the fear of God and firmly adhere to what is right. Verily I say,
the tongue is for mentioning what is good, defile it not with unseemly talk. God hath forgiven what is past.
Henceforward everyone should utter that which is meet and seemly, and should refrain from slander, abuse and
whatever causeth sadness in men. Lofty is the station of man! Not long ago this exalted Word streamed forth
from the treasury of Our Pen of Glory: Great and blessed is this Day -- the Day in which all that lay latent in
man hath been and will be made manifest. Lofty is the station of man, were he to hold fast to righteousness and
truth and to remain firm and steadfast in the Cause. In the eyes of the All-Merciful a true man appeareth even as
a firmament; its sun and moon are his sight and hearing, and his shining and resplendent character its stars. His
is the loftiest station, and his influence educateth the world of being.

Every receptive soul who hath in this Day inhaled the fragrance of His garment and hath, with a pure
heart, set his face towards the all-glorious Horizon is reckoned among the people of Baha in the Crimson Book.
Grasp ye, in My Name, the chalice of My loving-kindness, drink then your fill in My glorious and wondrous
remembrance.

O ye that dwell on earth! The religion of God is for love and unity; make it not the cause of enmity or
dissension. In the eyes of men of insight and the beholders of the Most Sublime Vision, whatsoever are the
effective means for safeguarding and promoting the happiness and welfare of the children of men hath already
been revealed by the Pen of Glory. But the foolish ones of the earth, being nurtured in evil passions and desires,
have remained heedless of the consummate wisdom of Him Who is, in truth, the All-Wise, while their words
and deeds are prompted by idle fancies and vain imaginings.

O ye the loved ones and the trustees of God! Kings are the manifestations of the power, and the
daysprings of the might and riches, of God. Pray ye on their behalf. He hath invested them with the rulership of
the earth and hath singled out the hearts of men as His Own domain.

Conflict and contention are categorically forbidden in His Book. This is a decree of God in this Most
Great Revelation. It is divinely preserved from annulment and is invested by Him with the splendour of His
confirmation. Verily He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

Blessed is the wayfarer who hath recognized the Desired One, and the seeker who hath heeded the Call
of Him Who is the intended Aim of all mankind, and the learned one who hath believed in God, the Help in
Peril, the Self-Subsisting.

How vast the number of the learned who have turned aside from the way of God and how numerous
the men devoid of learning who have apprehended the truth and hastened unto Him, saying, ‘Praised be Thou,
O Lord of all things, visible and invisible.’

By the righteousness of God! The world’s horizon is resplendent with the light of the Most Great
Luminary, yet the generality of mankind perceive it not. Verily He Who is the Sovereign Truth moveth before
the eyes of all men. Unto this beareth witness the One Who is proclaiming in the midmost heart of the world.
‘In truth no God is there but Me, Omnipotent over all things, whether of the past or the future.’

Great is the blessedness of the believer who hath directed himself towards Him and hath gained
admittance into His presence, and woe betide every disbeliever who hath turned away from God and followed
the wayward and the outcast.

Man is like unto a tree. If he be adorned with fruit, he hath been and will ever be worthy of praise and
commendation. Otherwise a fruitless tree is but fit for fire. The fruits of the human tree are exquisite, highly
desired and dearly cherished. Among them are upright character, virtuous deeds and a goodly utterance. The
springtime for earthly trees occurreth once every year, while the one for human trees appeareth in the Days of
God -- exalted be His glory. Were the trees of men’s lives to be adorned in this divine Springtime with the fruits
that have been mentioned, the effulgence of the light of Justice would, of a certainty illumine all the dwellers of
the earth and everyone would abide in tranquillity and contentment

beneath the sheltering shadow of Him Who is the Object of all mankind. The Water for these trees is the living
water of the sacred Words uttered by the Beloved of the world. In one instant are such trees planted and in the
next their branches shall, through the outpourings of the showers of divine mercy, have reached the skies. A
dried-up tree, however, hath never been nor will be worthy of any mention.

Happy is the faithful one who is attired with the vesture of high endeavour and hath arisen to serve this
Cause. Such a soul hath truly attained the desired Goal and hath apprehended the Object for which it hath been
created. But a myriad times alas for the wayward who are like unto dried-up leaves fallen upon the dust. Ere
long mortal blasts shall carry them away to the place ordained for them. Ignorant did they arrive, ignorant did
they linger and ignorant did they retire to their abodes.

The world is continually proclaiming these words: Beware, I am evanescent, and so are all my outward
appearances and colours. Take ye heed of the changes and chances contrived within me and be ye roused from
your slumber. Nevertheless there is no discerning eye to see, nor is there a hearing ear to hearken.

In this Day the inner ear exclaimeth and saith: Indeed well is it with me, today is my day, inasmuch as
the Voice of God is calling aloud. And the essence of vision crieth out: Blessed am I, this is my day, for the
Ancient Beauty is shining resplendent from the most exalted Horizon.

2. THE BAB
Excerpts from Selections from the Writings of the Bab21
S A Y , verily God hath caused all created things to enter beneath the shade of the tree of affirmation,
except those who are endowed with the faculty of understanding. Theirs is the choice either to believe in God
their Lord, and put their whole trust in Him, or to shut themselves out from Him and refuse to believe with
certitude in His signs. These two groups sail upon two seas: the sea of affirmation and the sea of negation.

They that truly believe in God and in His signs, and who in every Dispensation faithfully obey that
which hath been revealed in the Book -- such are indeed the ones whom God hath created from the fruits of the
Paradise of His good-pleasure, and who are of the blissful. But they who turn away from God and His signs in
each Dispensation, those are the ones who sail upon the sea of negation.

God hath, through the potency of His behest, ordained for Himself the task of ensuring the ascendancy
of the sea of affirmation and of bringing to naught the sea of negation through the power of His might. He is in
truth potent over all things.

Verily it is incumbent upon you to recognize your Lord at the time of His manifestation, that haply ye
may not enter into negation, and that, ere a prophet is raised by God, ye may find yourselves securely
established upon the sea of affirmation. For if a prophet cometh to you from God and ye fail to walk in His
Way, God will, thereupon, transform your light into fire. Take heed then that perchance ye may, through the
grace of God and His signs, be enabled to redeem your souls.

By My glory! I will make the infidels to taste, with the hands of My power, retributions unknown of
any one except Me, and will waft over the faithful those musk-scented breaths which I have nursed in the
midmost heart of My throne; and verily the knowledge of God embraceth all things.

O concourse of light! By the righteousness of God, We speak not according to selfish desire, nor hath a
single letter of this Book been revealed save by the leave of God, the Sovereign Truth. Fear ye God and
entertain no doubts regarding His Cause, for verily, the Mystery of this Gate is shrouded in the mystic
utterances of His Writ and hath been written beyond the impenetrable veil of concealment by the hand of God,
the Lord of the visible and the invisible.

Indeed God hath created everywhere around this Gate oceans of divine elixir, tinged crimson with the
essence of existence and vitalized through the animating power of the desired fruit; and for them God hath
provided Arks of ruby, tender, crimson-coloured, wherein none shall sail but the people of Baha, by the leave of
God, the Most Exalted; and verily He is the All-Glorious, the All-Wise.

Rid thou thyself of all attachments to aught except God, enrich thyself in God by dispensing with all
else besides Him, and recite this prayer:

Say: God sufficeth all things above all things, and nothing in the heavens or in the earth or
> in whatever lieth between them but God, thy Lord, sufficeth. Verily, He is in Himself the
> Knower, the Sustainer, the Omnipotent.
Regard not the all-sufficing power of God as an idle fancy. It is that genuine faith which thou
cherishest for the Manifestation of God in every Dispensation. It is such faith which sufficeth above all the
things that exist on the earth, whereas no created thing on earth besides faith would suffice thee. If thou art not
a believer, the Tree of divine Truth would condemn thee to extinction. If thou art a believer, thy faith shall be
sufficient for thee above all things that exist on earth, even though thou possess nothing.

O people of the Qur’an! Ye are as nothing unless ye submit unto the Remembrance of God and unto
this Book. If ye follow the Cause of God, We will forgive you your sins, and if ye turn aside from Our
command, We will, in truth, condemn your souls in Our Book, unto the Most Great Fire. We, verily, do not
deal unjustly with men, even to the extent of a speck on a date-stone.

O my God! There is no one but Thee to allay the anguish of my soul, and Thou art my highest
aspiration, O my God. My heart is wedded to none save Thee and such as Thou dost love. I solemnly declare
that my life and death are both for Thee. Verily Thou art incomparable and hast no partner.

O my Lord! I beg Thee to forgive me for shutting myself out from Thee. By Thy glory and majesty, I
have failed to befittingly recognize Thee and to worship Thee, while Thou dost make Thyself known unto me
and callest me to remembrance as beseemeth Thy station. Grievous woe would betide me, O my Lord, wert
Thou to take hold of me by reason of my misdeeds and trespasses. No helper do I know of other than Thee. No
refuge do I have to flee to save Thee. None among Thy creatures can dare to intercede with Thyself without
Thy leave. I hold fast to Thy love before Thy court, and, according to Thy bidding, I earnestly pray unto Thee
as befitteth Thy glory. I beg Thee to heed my call as Thou hast promised me. Verily Thou art God; no God is
there but Thee. Alone and unaided, Thou art independent of all created things. Neither can the devotion of Thy
lovers profit Thee, nor the evil doings of the faithless harm Thee. Verily Thou art my God, He Who will never
fail in His promise.

O my God! I beseech Thee by the evidences of Thy favour, to let me draw nigh to the sublime heights
of Thy holy presence, and protect me from inclining myself toward the subtle allusions of aught else but Thee.
Guide my steps, O my God, unto that which is acceptable and pleasing to Thee. Shield me, through Thy might,
from the fury of Thy wrath and chastisement, and hold me back from entering habitations not desired by Thee.

I am aware, O Lord, that my trespasses have covered my face with shame in Thy presence, and have
burdened my back before Thee, have intervened between me and Thy beauteous countenance, have compassed
me from every direction and have hindered me on all sides from gaining access unto the revelations of Thy
celestial power.

O Lord! If Thou forgivest me not, who is there then to grant pardon, and if Thou hast no mercy upon
me, who is capable of showing compassion? Glory be unto Thee, Thou didst create me when I was non-existent
and Thou didst nourish me while I was devoid of any understanding. Praise be unto Thee, every evidence of
bounty proceedeth from Thee and every token of grace emanateth from the treasuries of Thy decree.

I beg Thee to forgive me, O my Lord, for every mention but the mention of Thee, and for every praise
but the praise of Thee, and for every delight but delight in Thy nearness, and for every pleasure but the pleasure
of communion with Thee, and for every joy but the joy of Thy love and of Thy good-pleasure, and for all things
pertaining unto me which bear no relationship unto Thee, O Thou Who art the Lord of lords, He Who provideth
the means and unlocketh the doors.

O God our Lord! Protect us through Thy grace from whatsoever may be repugnant unto Thee and
vouchsafe unto us that which well beseemeth Thee. Give us more out of Thy bounty and bless us. Pardon us for
the things we have done and wash away our sins and forgive us with Thy gracious forgiveness. Verily Thou art
the Most Exalted, the Self-Subsisting.

Thy loving providence hath encompassed all created things in the heavens and on the earth, and Thy
forgiveness hath surpassed the whole creation. Thine is sovereignty; in Thy hand are the Kingdoms of Creation
and Revelation; in Thy right hand Thou holdest all created things and within Thy grasp are the assigned
measures of forgiveness. Thou forgivest whomsoever among Thy servants Thou pleasest.

Verily Thou art the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Loving. Nothing whatsoever escapeth Thy knowledge, and naught
is there which is hidden from Thee.

O God our Lord! Protect us through the potency of Thy might, enable us to enter Thy wondrous
surging ocean, and grant us that which well befitteth Thee.
Thou art the Sovereign Ruler, the Mighty Doer, the Exalted, the All-loving.

Vouchsafe unto me, O my God, the full measure of Thy love and Thy good-pleasure, and through the
attractions of Thy resplendent light enrapture our hearts, O Thou Who art the Supreme Evidence and the All-
Glorified. Send down upon me, as a token of Thy grace, Thy vitalizing breezes, throughout the day-time and in
the night season, O Lord of bounty.

No deed have I done, O my God, to merit beholding Thy face, and I know of a certainty that were I to
live as long as the world lasts I would fail to accomplish any deed such as to deserve this favour, inasmuch as
the station of a servant shall ever fall short of access to Thy holy precincts, unless Thy bounty should reach me
and Thy tender mercy pervade me and Thy loving-kindness encompass me.

I beg Thy forgiveness, O my God, and implore pardon after the manner Thou wishest Thy servants to
direct themselves to Thee. I beg of Thee to wash away our sins as befitteth Thy Lordship, and to forgive me,
my parents, and those who in Thy estimation have entered the abode of Thy love in a manner which is worthy
of Thy transcendent sovereignty and well beseemeth the glory of Thy celestial power.

O my God! Thou hast inspired my soul to offer its supplication to Thee, and but for Thee, I would not
call upon Thee. Lauded and glorified art Thou; I yield Thee praise inasmuch as Thou didst reveal Thyself unto
me, and I beg Thee to forgive me, since I have fallen short in my duty to know Thee and have failed to walk in
the path of Thy love.

It is seemly that the servant should, after each prayer, supplicate God to bestow mercy and forgiveness
upon his parents. Thereupon God’s call will be raised: ‘Thousand upon thousand of what thou hast asked for
thy parents shall be thy recompense!’ Blessed is he who remembereth his parents when communing with God.
There is, verily, no God but Him, the Mighty, the Well-Beloved.

Glory be unto Thee, O God. How can I make mention of Thee while Thou art sanctified from the
praise of all mankind. Magnified be Thy Name, O God, Thou art the King, the Eternal Truth; Thou knowest
what is in the heavens and on the earth, and unto Thee must all return. Thou hast sent down Thy divinely-
ordained Revelation according to a clear measure. Praised art Thou, O Lord! At Thy behest Thou dost render
victorious whomsoever Thou wiliest, through the hosts of heaven and earth and whatsoever existeth between
them. Thou art the Sovereign, the Eternal Truth, the Lord of invincible might.

Glorified art Thou, O Lord, Thou forgivest at all times the sins of such among Thy servants as implore
Thy pardon. Wash away my sins and the sins of those who seek Thy forgiveness at dawn, who pray to Thee in
the day-time and in the night season, who yearn after naught save God, who offer up whatsoever God hath
graciously bestowed upon them, who celebrate Thy praise at morn and eventide, and who are not remiss in their
duties.

Verily I am Thy servant, O my God, and Thy poor one and Thy suppliant and Thy wretched creature. I
have arrived at Thy gate, seeking Thy shelter. I have found no contentment save in Thy love, no exultation
except in Thy remembrance, no eagerness but in obedience to Thee, no joy save in Thy nearness, and no
tranquillity except in reunion with Thee, notwithstanding that I am conscious that all created things are
debarred from Thy sublime Essence and the entire creation is denied access to Thine inmost Being. Whenever I

attempt to approach Thee, I perceive nothing in myself but the tokens of Thy grace and behold naught in my
being but the revelations of Thy loving-kindness. How can one who is but Thy creature seek reunion with Thee
and attain unto Thy presence, whereas no created thing can ever be associated with Thee, nor can aught
comprehend Thee? How is it possible for a lowly servant to recognize Thee and to extol Thy praise,
notwithstanding that Thou hast destined for him the revelations of Thy dominion and the wondrous testimonies
of Thy sovereignty? Thus every created thing beareth witness that it is debarred from the sanctuary of Thy
presence by reason of the limitations imposed upon its inner reality. It is undisputed, however, that the
influence of Thine attraction hath everlastingly been inherent in the realities of Thy handiwork, although that
which beseemeth the hallowed court of Thy providence is exalted beyond the attainment of the entire creation.
This indicateth, O my God, my utter powerlessness to praise Thee and revealeth my utmost impotence in
yielding thanks unto Thee; and how much more to attain the recognition of Thy divine unity or to succeed in
reaching the clear tokens of Thy praise, Thy sanctity and Thy glory. Nay, by Thy might, I yearn for naught but
Thine Own Self and seek no one other than Thee.
O my God, O my Lord, O my Master! I beg Thee to forgive me for seeking any pleasure save Thy love, or any
comfort except Thy nearness, or any delight besides Thy good-pleasure, or any existence other than
communion with Thee.

Glory be to Thee, O God! Thou art the God Who hath existed before all things, Who will exist after all
things and will last beyond all things. Thou art the God Who knoweth all things, and is supreme over all things.
Thou art the God Who dealeth mercifully with all things, Who judgeth between all things and Whose vision
embraceth all things. Thou art God my Lord, Thou art aware of my position, Thou dost witness my inner and
outer being.

Grant Thy forgiveness unto me and unto the believers who responded to Thy Call. Be Thou my
sufficing helper against the mischief of whosoever may desire to inflict sorrow upon me or wish me ill. Verily
Thou art the Lord of all created things. Thou dost suffice everyone, while no one can be self-sufficient without
Thee.

O Lord! Thou art the Remover of every anguish and the Dispeller of every affliction. Thou art He Who
banisheth every sorrow and setteth free every slave, the Redeemer of every soul. O Lord! Grant deliverance
through Thy mercy and reckon me among such servants of Thine as have gained salvation.

> O Lord! Unto Thee I repair for refuge and toward all Thy signs I set my heart.

O Lord! Whether travelling or at home, and in my occupation or in my work, I place my whole trust in
Thee.

Grant me then Thy sufficing help so as to make me independent of all things, O Thou Who art
unsurpassed in Thy mercy!

Bestow upon me my portion, O Lord, as Thou pleasest, and cause me to be satisfied with whatsoever
Thou hast ordained for me.
Thine is the absolute authority to command.

3. ‘ABDU’L-BAHA
Excerpts from Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Baha22
O peoples of the world! The Sun of Truth hath risen to illumine the whole earth, and to spiritualize the
community of man. Laudable are the results and the fruits thereof, abundant the holy evidences deriving from
this grace. This is mercy unalloyed and purest bounty; it is light for the world and all its peoples; it is harmony
and fellowship, and love and solidarity; indeed it is compassion and unity, and the end of foreignness; it is the
being at one, in complete dignity and freedom, with all on earth.

The Blessed Beauty saith: ‘Ye are all the fruits of one tree, the leaves of one branch.’ Thus hath He
likened this world of being to a single tree, and all its peoples to the leaves thereof, and the blossoms and fruits.
It is needful for the bough to blossom, and leaf and fruit to flourish, and upon the interconnection of all parts of
the world-tree, dependeth the flourishing of leaf and blossom, and the sweetness of the fruit.

For this reason must all human beings powerfully sustain one another and seek for everlasting life; and
for this reason must the lovers of God in this contingent world become the mercies and the blessings sent forth
by that clement King of the seen and unseen realms. Let them purify their sight and behold all humankind as
leaves and blossoms and fruits of the tree of being. Let them at all times concern themselves with doing a
kindly thing for one of their fellows, offering to someone love, consideration, thoughtful help. Let them see no
one as their enemy, or as wishing them ill, but think of all humankind as their friends; regarding the alien as an
intimate, the stranger as a companion, staying free of prejudice, drawing no lines.

In this day, the one favoured at the Threshold of the Lord is he who handeth round the cup of
faithfulness; who bestoweth, even upon his enemies, the jewel of bounty, and lendeth, even to his fallen
oppressor, a helping hand; it is he who will, even to the fiercest of his foes, be a loving friend. These are the
Teachings of the Blessed Beauty, these the counsels of the Most Great Name.

O ye dear friends! The world is at war and the human race is in travail and mortal combat. The dark
night of hate hath taken over, and the light of good faith is blotted out. The peoples and kindreds of the earth
have sharpened their claws, and arc hurling themselves one against the other. It is the very foundation of the
human race that is being destroyed. It is thousands of households that are vagrant and dispossessed, and every
year seeth thousands upon thousands of human beings weltering in their life-blood on dusty battlefields. The
tents of life and joy are down. The generals practise their generalship, boasting of the blood they shed,
competing one with the next in inciting to violence. ‘With this sword,’ saith one of them. ‘I beheaded a people!’
And another: ‘I toppled a nation to the ground!’ And yet another: ‘I brought a government down!’ On such
things do men pride themselves, in such do they glory! Love -- righteousness -- these are everywhere censured,
while despised are harmony, and devotion to the truth.

The Faith of the Blessed Beauty is summoning mankind to safety and love, to amity and peace; it hath
raised up its tabernacle on the heights of the earth, and directeth its call to all nations. Wherefore, O ye who are
God’s lovers, know ye the value of this precious Faith, obey its teachings, walk in this road that is drawn
straight, and show ye this way to the people. Lift up your voices and sing out the song of the Kingdom. Spread
far and wide the precepts and counsels of the loving Lord, so that this world will change into another world, and
this darksome earth will be flooded with light, and the dead body of mankind will arise and live; so that every
soul will ask for immortality, through the holy breaths of God.

Soon will your swiftly-passing days be over, and the fame and riches, the comforts, the joys provided
by this rubbish-heap, the world, will be gone without a trace. Summon ye, then, the people to God, and invite
humanity to follow the example of the Company on high. Be ye loving fathers to the orphan, and a refuge to the
helpless, and a treasury for the poor, and a cure for the ailing. Be ye the helpers of every victim

\[22\] Baha’i World Centre, Haifa, 1978.

of oppression, the patrons of the disadvantaged. Think ye at all times of rendering some service to every
member of the human race. Pay ye no heed to aversion and rejection, to disdain, hostility, injustice; act ye in the
opposite way. Be ye sincerely kind, not in appearance only. Let each one of God’s loved ones centre his
attention on this: to be the Lord’s mercy to man; to be the Lord’s grace. Let him do some good to every person
whose path he crosseth, and be of some benefit to him. Let him improve the character of each and all, and
reorient the minds of men. In this way, the light of divine guidance will shine forth, and the blessings of God
will cradle all mankind; for love is light, no matter in what abode it dwelleth; and hate is darkness, no matter
where it may make its nest. O friends of God! That the hidden Mystery may stand revealed, and the secret
essence of all things may be disclosed, strive ye to banish that darkness for ever and ever.

O ye peoples of the Kingdom! How many a soul expended all its span of life in worship, endured the
mortification of the flesh, longed to gain an entry into the Kingdom, and yet failed, while ye, with neither toil
nor pain nor self-denial, have won the prize and entered in.

It is even as in the time of the Messiah, when the Pharisees and the pious were left without a portion,
while Peter, John and Andrew, given neither to pious worship nor ascetic practice, won the day. Wherefore,
thank ye God for setting upon your heads the crown of glory everlasting, for granting unto you this
immeasurable grace.

The time hath come when as a thank-offering for this bestowal, ye should grow in faith and constancy
as day followeth day, and should draw ever nearer to the Lord, your God, becoming magnetized to such a
degree, and so aflame, that your holy melodies in praise of the Beloved will reach upward to the Company on
high; and that each one of you, even as a nightingale in this rose garden of God, will glorify the Lord of Hosts,
and become the teacher of all who dwell on earth.

Service to the friends is service to the Kingdom of God, and consideration shown to the poor is one of
the greatest teachings of God.

O ye illumined loved ones and ye handmaids of the Merciful! At a time when the sombre night of
ignorance, of neglect of the divine world, of being veiled from God, had overspread the earth, a bright morning
dawned and a rising light lit up the eastern sky. Then rose the Sun of Truth and the splendours of the Kingdom
were shed over east and west. Those who had eyes to see rejoiced at the glad tidings and cried out: ‘O blessed,
blessed are we!’, and they witnessed the inner reality of all things, and uncovered the mysteries of the
Kingdom. Delivered then from their fancies and their doubts, they beheld the light of truth, and so exhilarated
did they become from draining the chalice of God’s love, that they utterly forgot the world and their own
selves. Dancing for joy they hastened to the place of their own martyrdom and there, where men die for love,
they flung away their heads and hearts.

But those with unseeing eyes were astonished at this tumult, and they cried, ‘Where is the light?’ and
again, ‘We see no light! We see no rising sun! Here is no truth. This is but fantasy and nothing more.’ Bat-like
they fled into the underground dark, and there, to their way of thinking, they found a measure of security and
peace.

This, however, is but the beginning of the dawn, and the heat of the rising Orb of Truth is not yet at the
fullness of its power. Once the sun hath mounted to high noon, its fires will burn so hot as to stir even the
creeping things beneath the earth; and although it is not for them to behold the light, yet will they all be set in
frenzied motion by the impact of the heat.

Wherefore, O ye beloved of God, offer up thanks that ye have, in the day of the dawning, turned your
faces unto the Light of the World and beheld its splendours. Ye have received a share of the light of truth, ye
have enjoyed a portion of those blessings that endure forever; and therefore, as a returning of thanks for this
bounty, rest ye not for a moment, sit ye not silent, carry to men’s ears the glad tidings of the Kingdom, spread
far and wide the Word of God.

Act in accordance with the counsels of the Lord: that is, rise up in such wise, and with such qualities,
as to endow the body of this world with a living soul, and to bring this young child, humanity, to the stage of
adulthood. So far as ye are able, ignite a candle of love in every meeting, and with tenderness rejoice and cheer
ye every heart. Care for the stranger as for one of your own; show to alien souls the same loving kindness ye
bestow upon your faithful friends. Should any come to blows with you, seek to be friends with him; should any
stab you to the heart, be ye a healing salve unto his sores; should any taunt and mock at you, meet him with
love. Should any heap his blame upon you, praise ye him; should he offer you a deadly poison, give him the
choicest honey in exchange; and should he threaten your life, grant him a remedy that will heal him evermore.
Should he be pain itself, be ye his medicine; should he be thorns, be ye his roses and sweet herbs. Perchance
such ways and words from you will make this darksome world turn bright at last; will make this dusty earth
turn heavenly, this devilish prison place become a royal palace of the Lord -- so that war and strife will pass and
be no more, and love and trust will pitch their tents on the summits of the world. Such is the essence of God’s
admonitions; such in sum arc the teachings for the Dispensation of Baha.

When Christ appeared, twenty centuries ago, although the Jews were eagerly awaiting His Coming,
and prayed every day, with tears, saying: ‘O God, hasten the Revelation of the Messiah,’ yet when the Sun of
Truth dawned, they denied Him and rose against Him with the greatest enmity, and eventually crucified that
divine Spirit, the Word of God, and named Him Beelzebub, the evil one, as is recorded in the Gospel. The
reason for this was that they said: ‘The Revelation of Christ, according to the clear text of the Torah, will be
attested by certain signs, and so long as these signs have not appeared, whoso layeth claim to be a Messiah is an
impostor. Among these signs is this, that the Messiah should come from an unknown place, yet we all know
this man’s house in Nazareth, and can any good thing come out of Nazareth? The second sign is that He shall
rule with a rod of iron, that is, He must act with the sword, but this Messiah has not even a wooden staff.
Another of the conditions and signs is this: He must sit upon the throne of David and establish David’s
sovereignty. Now, far from being enthroned, this man has not even a mat to sit on. Another of the conditions is
this: the promulgation of all the laws of the Torah; yet this man has abrogated these laws, and has even broken
the sabbath day, although it is the clear text of the Torah that whosoever layeth claim to prophethood and
revealeth miracles and breaketh the sabbath day, must be put to death. Another of the signs is this, that in His
reign justice will be so advanced that righteousness and well-doing will extend from the human even to the
animal world -- the snake and the mouse will share one hole, and the eagle and the partridge one nest, the lion
and the gazelle shall dwell in one pasture, and the wolf and the kid shall drink from one fountain. Yet now,
injustice and tyranny have waxed so great in his time that they have crucified him! Another of the conditions is
this, that in the days of the Messiah the Jews will prosper and triumph over all the peoples of the world, but
now they are living in the utmost abasement and servitude in the empire of the Romans. Then how can this be
the Messiah promised in the Torah?’

In this wise did they object to that Sun of Truth, although that Spirit of God was indeed the One
promised in the Torah. But as they did not understand the meaning of these signs, they crucified the Word of
God. Now the Baha’is hold that the recorded signs did come to pass in the Manifestation of Christ, although not
in the sense which the Jews understood, the description in the Torah being allegorical. For instance, among the
signs is that of sovereignty. For Baha’is say that the sovereignty of Christ was a heavenly, divine, everlasting
sovereignty, not a Napoleonic sovereignty that vanisheth in a short time. For well nigh two thousand years this
sovereignty of Christ hath been established, and until now it endureth, and to all eternity that Holy Being will
be exalted upon an everlasting throne.

In like manner all the other signs have been made manifest, but the Jews did not understand. Although
nearly twenty centuries have elapsed since Christ appeared with divine

splendour, yet the Jews are still awaiting the coming of the Messiah and regard themselves as true and Christ as
false.

O leaf upon the Tree of Life! The Tree of Life, of which mention is made in the Bible, is Baha’u’llah,
and the daughters of the Kingdom are the leaves upon that blessed Tree. Then thank thou God that thou hast
become related to that Tree, and that thou art flourishing, tender and fresh.

The gates of the Kingdom are opened wide, and every favoured soul is seated at the banquet table of
the Lord, receiving his portion of that heavenly feast. Praised be God, thou too art present at this table, taking
thy share of the bountiful food of heaven. Thou art serving the Kingdom, and art well acquainted with the sweet
savours of the Abha Paradise.

Then strive thou with all thy might to guide the people, and eat thou of the bread that hath come down
from heaven. For this is the meaning of Christ’s words: ‘I am the living bread which came down from heaven ...
he that eateth of this bread shall live forever.’23

O handmaid of God, who tremblest even as a fresh and tender branch in the winds of the love of God!

I have read thy letter, which telleth of thine abundant love, thine intense devotion, and of thy being occupied
with the remembrance of thy Lord.

Depend thou upon God. Forsake thine own will and cling to His, set aside thine own desires and lay
hold of His, that thou mayest become an example, holy, spiritual, and of the Kingdom, unto His handmaids.

Know thou, O handmaid, that in the sight of Baha, women are accounted the same as men, and God
hath created all humankind in His own image, and after His own likeness. That is, men and women alike are the
revealers of His names and attributes, and from the spiritual viewpoint there is no difference between them.
Whosoever draweth nearer to God, that one is the most favoured, whether man or woman. How many a
handmaid, ardent and devoted, hath, within the sheltering shade of Baha, proved superior to the men, and
surpassed the famous of the earth.

The House of Justice, however, according to the explicit text of the Law of God, is confined to men;
this for a wisdom of the Lord God’s, which will ere long be made manifest as clearly as the sun at high noon.

As to you, O ye other handmaids who are enamoured of the heavenly fragrances, arrange ye holy
gatherings, and found ye Spiritual Assemblies, for these are the basis for spreading the sweet savours of God,
exalting His Word, uplifting the lamp of His grace, promulgating His religion and promoting His Teachings,
and what bounty is there greater than this? These Spiritual Assemblies are aided by the Spirit of God. Their
defender is ‘Abdu’l-Baha’. Over them He spreadeth His wings. What bounty is there greater than this? These
Spiritual Assemblies arc shining lamps and heavenly gardens, from which the fragrances of holiness are
diffused over all regions, and the lights of knowledge are shed abroad over all created things. From them the
spirit of life streameth in every direction. They, indeed, are the potent sources of the progress of man, at all
times and under all conditions. What bounty is there greater than this?

The prime requisites for them that take counsel together are purity of motive, radiance of spirit,
detachment from all else save God, attraction to His Divine Fragrances, humility and lowliness amongst His
loved ones, patience and long-suffering in difficulties and servitude to His exalted Threshold. Should they be
graciously aided to acquire these attributes, victory from the unseen Kingdom of Baha shall be vouchsafed to
them.

The members thereof24 must take counsel together in such wise that no occasion for ill-feeling or
discord may arise. This can be attained when every member expresseth with absolute freedom his own opinion
and setteth forth his argument. Should anyone oppose, he must on no account feel hurt for not until matters are
fully discussed can the right way be

revealed. The shining spark of truth cometh forth only after the clash of differing opinions. If after discussion, a
decision be carried unanimously well and good; but if, the Lord forbid, differences of opinion should arise, a
majority of voices must prevail.

You have asked as to the feast in every Baha’i month. This feast is held to foster comradeship and
love, to call God to mind and supplicate Him with contrite hearts, and to encourage benevolent pursuits.

That is, the friends should there dwell upon God and glorify Him, read the prayers and holy verses,
and treat one another with the utmost affection and love.

As to the Nineteen Day Feast, it rejoiceth mind and heart. If this feast be held in the proper fashion, the
friends will, once in nineteen days, find themselves spiritually restored, and endued with a power that is not of
this world.

O bird that singeth sweetly of the Abha Beauty! In this new and wondrous dispensation the veils of
superstition have been torn asunder and the prejudices of eastern peoples stand condemned. Among certain
nations of the East, music was considered reprehensible, but in this new age the Manifest Light hath, in His
holy Tablets, specifically proclaimed that music, sung or played, is spiritual food for soul and heart.

The musician’s art is among those arts worthy of the highest praise, and it moveth the hearts of all who
grieve. Wherefore, O thou Shahnaz,25 play and sing out the holy words of God with wondrous tones in the
gatherings of the friends, that the listener may be freed from chains of care and sorrow, and his soul may leap
for joy and humble itself in prayer to the realm of Glory.

Strive with heart and soul in order to bring about union and harmony among the white and the black
and prove thereby the unity of the Baha’i world wherein distinction of colour findeth no place, but where hearts
only are considered. Praise be to God, the hearts of the friends are united and linked together, whether they be
from the east or the west, from north or from south, whether they be German, French, Japanese, American, and
whether they pertain to the white, the black, the red, the yellow or the brown race. Variations of colour, of land
and of race are of no importance in the Baha’i Faith; on the contrary, Baha’i unity overcometh them all and
doeth away with all these fancies and imaginations.

O thou who hast an illumined heart! Thou art even as the pupil of the eye, the very wellspring of the
light, for God’s love hath cast its rays upon thine inmost being and thou hast turned thy face toward the
Kingdom of thy Lord.

Intense is the hatred, in America, between black and white, but my hope is that the power of the
Kingdom will bind these two in friendship, and serve them as a healing balm.

Let them look not upon a man’s colour but upon his heart. If the heart be filled with light, that man is
nigh unto the threshold of his Lord; but if not, that man is careless of his Lord, be he white or be he black.

O thou dear handmaid of God! Thy letter hath been received, and its contents were noted.
Marriage, among the mass of the people, is a physical bond, and this union can only be temporary,
since it is foredoomed to a physical separation at the close.

Among the people of Baha, however, marriage must be a union of the body and of the spirit as well,
for here both husband and wife are aglow with the same wine, both are enamoured of the same matchless Face,
both live and move through the same spirit, both are illumined by the same glory. This connection between
them is a spiritual one, hence it is a bond that will abide forever. Likewise do they enjoy strong and lasting ties
in the physical world as well, for if the marriage is based both on the spirit and the body, that union is a true

\[25\] Shahnaz, the name given to the recipient of this Tablet, is also the name of a musical mode.

one, hence it will endure. If, however, the bond is physical and nothing more, it is sure to be only temporary,
and must inexorably end in separation.

When, therefore, the people of Baha undertake to marry, the union must be a true relationship, a
spiritual coming together as well as a physical one, so that throughout every phase of life, and in all the worlds
of God, their union will endure; for this real oneness is a gleaming out of the love of God.

In the same way, when any souls grow to be true believers, they will attain a spiritual relationship with
one another, and show forth a tenderness which is not of this world. They will, all of them, become elated from
a draught of divine love, and that union of theirs, that connection, will also abide forever. Souls, that is, who
will consign their own selves to oblivion, strip from themselves the defects of humankind, and unchain
themselves from human bondage, will beyond any doubt be illumined with the heavenly splendours of oneness,
and will all attain unto real union in the world that dieth not.

As for the question regarding marriage under the Law of God: first thou must choose one who is
pleasing to thee, and then the matter is subject to the consent of father and mother. Before thou makest thy
choice, they have no right to interfere.

Baha’i marriage is the commitment of the two parties one to the other, and their mutual attachment of
mind and heart. Each must, however, exercise the utmost care to become thoroughly acquainted with the
character of the other, that the binding covenant between them may be a tie that will endure forever. Their
purpose must be this: to become loving companions and comrades and at one with each other for time and
eternity. ...

The true marriage of Baha’is is this, that husband and wife should be united both physically and
spiritually, that they may ever improve the spiritual life of each other, and may enjoy everlasting unity
throughout all the worlds of God. This is Baha’i marriage.

O handmaids of the Lord! The spiritual assemblage that ye established in that illumined city is most
propitious. Ye have made great strides; ye have surpassed the others, have arisen to serve the Holy Threshold,
and have won heavenly bestowals. Now with all spiritual zeal must ye gather in that enlightened assemblage
and recite the Holy Writings and engage in remembering the Lord. Set ye forth His arguments and proofs.
Work ye for the guidance of the women in that land, teach the young girls and the children, so that the mothers
may educate their little ones from their earliest days, thoroughly train them, rear them to have a goodly
character and good morals, guide them to all the virtues of humankind, prevent the development of any
behaviour that would be worthy of blame, and foster them in the embrace of Baha’i education. Thus shall these
tender infants be nurtured at the breast of the knowledge of God and His love. Thus shall they grow and
flourish, and be taught righteousness and the dignity of humankind, resolution and the will to strive and to
endure. Thus shall they learn perseverance in all things, the will to advance, high mindedness and high resolve,
chastity and purity of life. Thus shall they be enabled to carry to a successful conclusion whatsoever they
undertake.

Let the mothers consider that whatever concerneth the education of children is of the first importance.

Let them put forth every effort in this regard, for when the bough is green and tender it will grow in whatever
way ye train it. Therefore is it incumbent upon the mothers to rear their little ones even as a gardener tendeth
his young plants. Let them strive by day and by night to establish within their children faith and certitude, the
fear of God, the love of the Beloved of the worlds, and all good qualities and traits. Whensoever a mother seeth
that her child hath done well, let her praise and applaud him and cheer his heart; and if the slightest undesirable
trait should manifest itself, let her counsel the child and punish him, and use means based on reason, even a
slight verbal chastisement should this be necessary. It is not, however, permissible to strike a child, or vilify
him, for the child’s character will be totally perverted if he be subjected to blows or verbal abuse.

As to the difference between that material civilization now prevailing, and the divine civilization
which will be one of the benefits to derive from the House of Justice, it is this: material civilization, through the
power of punitive and retaliatory laws, restraineth the people from criminal acts; and notwithstanding this,
while laws to retaliate against and punish a man are continually proliferating, as ye can see, no laws exist to
reward him. In all the cities of Europe and America, vast buildings have been erected to serve as jails for the
criminals.

Divine civilization, however, so traineth every member of society that no one, with the exception of a
negligible few, will undertake to commit a crime. There is thus a great difference between the prevention of
crime through measures that are violent and retaliatory, and so training the people, and enlightening them, and
spiritualizing them, that without any fear of punishment or vengeance to come, they will shun all criminal acts.
They will, indeed, look upon the very commission of a crime as a great disgrace and in itself the harshest of
punishments. They will become enamoured of human perfections, and will consecrate their lives to whatever
will bring light to the world and will further those qualities which are acceptable at the Holy Threshold of God.

See then how wide is the difference between material civilization and divine. With force and
punishments, material civilization seeketh to restrain the people from mischief, from inflicting harm on society
and committing crimes. But in a divine civilization, the individual is so conditioned that with no fear of
punishment, he shunneth the perpetration of crimes, seeth the crime itself as the severest of torments, and with
alacrity and joy, setteth himself to acquiring the virtues of humankind, to furthering human progress, and to
spreading light across the world.

It is incumbent upon Baha’i children to surpass other children in the acquisition of sciences and arts,
for they have been cradled in the grace of God.

Whatever other children learn in a year, let Baha’i children learn in a month. The heart of ‘Abdu’l-
Baha longeth, in its love, to find that Baha’i young people, each and all, are known throughout the world for
their intellectual attainments. There is no question but that they will exert all their efforts, their energies, their
sense of pride, to acquire the sciences and arts.

O Friends of the Pure and Omnipotent God! To be pure and holy in all things is an attribute of the
consecrated soul and a necessary characteristic of the unenslaved mind. The best of perfections is immaculacy
and the freeing of oneself from every defect. Once the individual is, in every respect, cleansed and purified,
then will he become a focal centre reflecting the Manifest Light.

First in a human being’s way of life must be purity, then freshness, cleanliness, and independence of
spirit. First must the stream bed be cleansed, then may the sweet river waters be led into it. Chaste eyes enjoy
the beatific vision of the Lord and know what this encounter meaneth; a pure sense inhaleth the fragrances that
blow from the rose gardens of His grace; a burnished heart will mirror forth the comely face of truth.

This is why, in Holy Scriptures, the counsels of heaven are likened to water, even as the Qur’an saith:
‘And pure water send We down from Heaven,’26 and the Gospel: ‘Except a man be baptized of water and of the
spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.’27 Thus is it clear that the Teachings which come from God are
heavenly outpourings of grace; they are rain-showers of divine mercy, and they cleanse the human heart.

My meaning is this, that in every aspect of life, purity and holiness, cleanliness and refinement, exalt
the human condition and further the development of man’s inner reality. Even in the physical realm, cleanliness
will conduce to spirituality, as the Holy Writings clearly state. And although bodily cleanliness is a physical
thing, it hath, nevertheless, a powerful influence on the life of the spirit. It is even as a voice wondrously sweet,
or a melody played: although sounds are but vibrations in the air which affect the ear’s auditory nerve, and
these vibrations are but chance phenomena carried along through the air, even

\[26\] Qur’an 25:50.

\[27\] cf. John 3:5.

so, see how they move the heart. A wondrous melody is wings for the spirit, and maketh the soul to tremble for
joy. The purport is that physical cleanliness doth also exert its effect upon the human soul.

Observe how pleasing is cleanliness in the sight of God, and how specifically it is emphasized in the
Holy Books of the Prophets; for the Scriptures forbid the eating or the use of any unclean thing. Some of these
prohibitions were absolute, and binding upon all, and whoso transgressed the given law was abhorred of God
and anathematized by the believers. Such, for example, were things categorically forbidden, the perpetration of
which was accounted a most grievous sin, among them actions so loathsome that it is shameful even to speak
their name.

But there are other forbidden things which do not cause immediate harm, and the injurious effects of
which are only gradually produced: such acts are also repugnant to the Lord, and blameworthy in His sight, and
repellent. The absolute unlawfulness of these, however, hath not been expressly set forth in the Text, but their
avoidance is necessary to purity, cleanliness, the preservation of health, and freedom from addiction.

Among these latter is smoking tobacco, which is dirty, smelly, offensive -- an evil habit, and one the
harmfulness of which gradually becometh apparent to all. Every qualified physician hath ruled -- and this hath
also been proven by tests -- that one of the components of tobacco is a deadly poison, and that the smoker is
vulnerable to many and various diseases. This is why smoking hath been plainly set forth as repugnant from the
standpoint of hygiene.

The Bab, at the outset of His mission, explicitly prohibited tobacco, and the friends one and all
abandoned its use. But since those were times when dissimulation was permitted, and every individual who
abstained from smoking was exposed to harassment, abuse and even death -the friends, in order not to advertise
their beliefs, would smoke. Later on, the Book of Aqdas was revealed, and since smoking tobacco was not
specifically forbidden there, the believers did not give it up. The

Blessed Beauty, however, always expressed repugnance for it, and although, in the early days, there were
reasons why He would smoke a little tobacco, in time He completely renounced it, and those sanctified souls
who followed Him in all things also abandoned its use.

My meaning is that in the sight of God, smoking tobacco is deprecated, abhorrent, filthy in the
extreme; and, albeit by degrees, highly injurious to health. It is also a waste of money and time, and maketh the
user a prey to a noxious addiction. To those who stand firm in the Covenant, this habit is therefore censured
both by reason and experience, and renouncing it will bring relief and peace of mind to all men. Furthermore,
this will make it possible to have a fresh mouth and unstained fingers, and hair that is free of a foul and
repellent smell. On receipt of this missive, the friends will surely, by whatever means and even over a period of
time, forsake this pernicious habit. Such is my hope.

As to opium, it is foul and accursed. God protect us from the punishment He inflicteth on the user.

According to the explicit Text of the Most Holy Book, it is forbidden, and its use is utterly condemned. Reason
showeth that smoking opium is a kind of insanity, and experience attesteth that the user is completely cut off
from the human kingdom. May God protect all against the perpetration of an act so hideous as this, an act
which layeth in ruins the very foundation of what it is to be human, and which causeth the user to be
dispossessed for ever and ever. For opium fasteneth on the soul, so that the user’s conscience dieth, his mind is
blotted away, his perceptions are eroded. It turneth the living into the dead. It quencheth the natural heat. No
greater harm can be conceived than that which opium inflicteth. Fortunate are they who never even speak the
name of it; then think how wretched is the user.

O ye lovers of God! In this, the cycle of Almighty God, violence and force, constraint and oppression,
are one and all condemned. It is, however, mandatory that the use of opium be prevented by any means
whatsoever, that perchance the human race may be delivered from this most powerful of plagues. And
otherwise, woe and misery to whoso falleth short of his duty to his Lord.28

O Divine Providence! Bestow Thou in all things purity and cleanliness upon the people of Baha. Grant
that they be freed from all defilement, and released from all addictions. Save them from committing any
repugnant act, unbind them from the chains of every evil habit, that they may live pure and free, wholesome
and cleanly, worthy to serve at Thy Sacred Threshold and fit to be related to their Lord. Deliver them from
intoxicating d r i n k s and tobacco, save them, rescue them, from this opium that bringeth on madness, suffer
them to enjoy the sweet savours of holiness, that they may drink deep of the mystic cup of heavenly love and
know the rapture of being drawn ever closer unto the Realm of the All-Glorious. For it is even as Thou hast
said: ‘All that thou hast in thy cellar will not appease the thirst of my love -- bring me, O cup-bearer, of the
wine of the spirit a cup full as the sea!’

O ye, God’s loved ones! Experience hath shown how greatly the renouncing of smoking, of
intoxicating drink, and of opium, conduceth to health and vigour, to the expansion and keenness of the mind
and to bodily strength. There is today a people29 who strictly avoid tobacco, intoxicating liquor and opium. This
people is far and away superior to the others, for strength and physical courage, for health, beauty and
comeliness. A single one of their men can stand up to ten men of another tribe. This hath proved true of the
entire people; that is, member for member, each individual of this community is in every respect superior to the
individuals of other communities.

Make ye then a mighty effort, that the purity and sanctity which, above all else, are cherished by
‘Abdu’l-Baha, shall distinguish the people of Baha; that in every kind of excellence the people of God shall
surpass all other human beings; that both outwardly and inwardly they shall prove superior to the rest; that for
purity, immaculacy, refinement, and the preservation of health, they shall be leaders in the vanguard of those
who know. And that by their freedom from enslavement, their knowledge, their self-control, they shall be first
among the pure, the free and the wise.

There are two ways of healing sickness, material means and spiritual means. The first is by

\[28\] cf. Qur’an 39:57.

\[29\] The Sikhs.

--- A glimpse of ‘Abdu’l-Baha in the Holy Land. ---

the treatment of physicians; the second consisted in prayers offered by the spiritual ones to God and in turning
to Him. Both means should be used and practised.

Illnesses which occur by reason of physical causes should be treated by doctors with medical
remedies; those which are due to spiritual causes disappear through spiritual means. Thus an illness caused by
affliction, fear, nervous impressions, will be healed more effectively by spiritual rather than by physical
treatment. Hence, both kinds of treatment should be followed; they are not contradictory. Therefore thou
shouldst also accept physical remedies inasmuch as these too have come from the mercy and favour of God,
Who hath revealed and made manifest medical science so that His servants may profit from this kind of
treatment also. Thou shouldst give equal attention to spiritual treatments, for they produce marvellous effects.

Now, if thou wishest to know the true remedy which will heal man from all sickness and will give him
the health of the divine kingdom, know that it is the precepts and teachings of God. Focus thine attention upon
them.

O lover of humankind! Thy letter hath been received, and it telleth, God be praised, of thy health and
well-being. It appeareth, from thine answer to a previous letter, that feelings of affection were being established
between thyself and the friends.

One must see in every human being only that which is worthy of praise. When this is done, one can be
a friend to the whole human race. If, however, we look at people from the standpoint of their faults, then being
a friend to them is a formidable task.

It happened one day in the time of Christ -- may the life of the world be a sacrifice unto Him -- that He
passed by the dead body of a dog, a carcass reeking, hideous, the limbs rotting away. One of those present said:
‘How foul its stench!’ And another said: ‘How sickening! How loathsome!’ To be brief, each one of them had
something to add to the list.
But then Christ Himself spoke, and He told them: ‘Look at that dog’s teeth! How gleaming white!’

The Messiah’s sin-covering gaze did not for a moment dwell upon the repulsiveness of that carrion.

The one element of that dead dog’s carcass which was not abomination was the teeth: and Jesus looked upon
their brightness.

Thus is it incumbent upon us, when we direct our gaze toward other people, to see where they excel,
not where they fail.

Praise be to God, thy goal is to promote the well-being of humankind and to help the souls to
overcome their faults. This good intention will produce laudable results.

As to thy question, doth every soul without exception achieve life everlasting? Know thou that
immortality belongeth to those souls in whom hath been breathed the spirit of life from God. All save these are
lifeless -- they are the dead, even as Christ hath explained in the Gospel text. He whose eyes the Lord hath
opened will see the souls of men in the stations they will occupy after their release from the body. He will find
the living ones thriving within the precincts of their Lord, and the dead sunk down in the lowest abyss of
perdition.

Know thou that every soul is fashioned after the nature of God, each being pure and holy at his birth.

Afterwards, however, the individuals will vary according to what they acquire of virtues or vices in this world.
Although all existent beings are in their very nature created in ranks or degrees, for capacities are various,
nevertheless every individual is born holy and pure, and only thereafter may he become defiled.

And further, although the degrees of being are various, yet ail are good. Observe the human body, its
limbs, its members, the eye, the ear, the organs of smell, of taste, the hands, the fingernails. Notwithstanding the
differences among all these parts, each one within the limitations of its own being participateth in a coherent
whole. If one of them faileth it must be healed, and should no remedy avail, that part must be removed.

Those souls that, in this day, enter the divine kingdom and attain everlasting life, although materially
dwelling on earth, yet in reality soar in the realm of heaven. Their bodies may linger on earth but their spirits
travel in the immensity of space. For as thoughts widen and become illumined, they acquire the power of flight
and transport man to the kingdom of God.

O thou servant of God! Do not grieve at the afflictions and calamities that have befallen thee. All
calamities and afflictions have been created for man so that he may spurn this mortal world -a world to which
he is much attached. When he cxperienceth severe trials and hardships, then his nature will recoil and he will
desire the eternal realm -- a realm which is sanctified from all afflictions and calamities. Such is the case with
the man who is wise. He shall never drink from a cup which is at the end distasteful, but, on the contrary, he
will seek the cup of pure and limpid water. He will not taste of the honey that is mixed with poison.

Praise thou God, that thou hast been tried and hast experienced such a test. Be patient and grateful.

Turn thy face to the divine Kingdom and strive that thou mayest acquire merciful characteristics, mayest
become illumined and acquire the attributes of the Kingdom and of the Lord. Endeavour to become indifferent
to the pleasures of this world and to its comfort, to remain firm and steadfast in the Covenant and to promulgate
the Cause of God.
This is the cause of the exaltation of man, the cause of his glory and of his salvation.

Follow thou the way of thy Lord, and say not that which the ears cannot bear to hear, for such speech
is like luscious food given to small children. However palatable, rare and rich the food may be, it cannot be
assimilated by the digestive organs of a suckling child. Therefore unto every one who hath a right, let his settled
measure be given.

‘Not everything that a man knoweth can be disclosed, nor can everything that he can disclose be
regarded as timely, nor can every timely utterance be considered as suited to the capacity of those who hear it.’
Such is the consummate wisdom to be observed in thy pursuits. Be not oblivious thereof, if thou wishest to be a
man of action under all conditions. First diagnose the disease and identify the malady, then prescribe the
remedy, for such is the perfect method of the skilful physician.

The teacher, when teaching, must be himself fully enkindled, so that his utterance, like unto a flame of
fire, may exert influence and consume the veil of self and passion. He must also be utterly humble and lowly so
that others may be edified, and be totally self-effaced and evanescent so that he may teach with the melody of
the Concourse on high -- otherwise his teaching will have no effect.

O God, my God! Lowly and tearful, I raise my suppliant hands to Thee and cover my face in the dust
of that Threshold of Thine, exalted above the knowledge of the learned, and the praise of all that glorify Thee.
Graciously look upon Thy servant, humble and lowly at Thy door, with the glances of the eye of Thy mercy,
and immerse him in the Ocean of Thine eternal grace.

Lord! He is a poor and lowly servant of Thine, enthralled and imploring Thee, captive in Thy hand,
praying fervently to Thee, trusting in Thee, in tears before Thy face, calling to Thee and beseeching Thee,
saying:

O Lord, my God! Give me Thy grace to serve Thy loved ones, strengthen me in my servitude to Thee,
illumine my brow with the light of adoration in Thy court of holiness, and of prayer to Thy Kingdom of
grandeur. Help me to be selfless at the heavenly entrance of Thy gate, and aid me to be detached from all things
within Thy holy precincts. Lord! Give me to drink from the chalice of selflessness; with its robe clothe me, and
in its ocean immerse me. Make me as dust in the pathway of Thy loved ones, and grant that I may offer up my
soul for the earth ennobled by the footsteps of Thy chosen ones in Thy path, O Lord of Glory in the Highest.

With this prayer doth Thy servant call Thee, at dawntide and in the night-season. Fulfil his heart’s
desire, O Lord! Illumine his heart, gladden his bosom, kindle his light, that he may serve Thy Cause and Thy
servants.
Thou art the Bestower, the Pitiful, the Most Bountiful, the Gracious, the Merciful, the Compassionate.

EXCERPTS FROM THE WRITINGS OF SHOGHI EFFENDI

A WIDER LOYALTY
Excerpts concerning the oneness of mankind from Call to the Nations30
M Y S T E R I O U S L Y , slowly, and resistlessly God accomplishes His design, though the sight that meets
our eyes in this day be the spectacle of a world hopelessly entangled in its own meshes, utterly careless of the
Voice which, for a century, has been calling it to God, and miserably subservient to the siren voices which are
attempting to lure it into the vast abyss.

God’s purpose is none other than to usher in, in ways He alone can bring about, and the full
significance of which He alone can fathom, the Great, the Golden Age; of a long-divided, a long-afflicted
humanity. Its present state, indeed even its immediate future, is dark, distressingly dark. Its distant future,
however, is radiant, gloriously radiant -- so radiant that no eye can visualize it.

The contrast between the accumulating evidences of steady consolidation that accompany the rise of
the Administrative Order of the Faith of God, and the forces of disintegration which batter at the fabric of a
travailing society, is as clear as it is arresting. Both within and outside the Baha’i world the signs and tokens
which, in a mysterious manner, are heralding the birth of that World Order, the establishment of which must
signalize the Golden Age of the Cause of God, are growing and multiplying day by day. No fair-minded
observer can any longer, fail to discern them. He cannot be misled by the painful slowness characterizing the
unfoldment of the civilization which the followers of Baha’u’llah are labouring to establish: Nor can he be
deluded by the ephemeral manifestations of returning prosperity which at times appear to be capable of
checking the disruptive influence of the chronic ills afflicting the institutions of a decaying age. The signs of the
times are too numerous and compelling to allow him to mistake their character or to belittle their significance.
He can, if he be fair in his judgement, recognize in the chain of events which proclaim on. the one hand the
irresistible march of the institutions directly associated with the Revelation of Baha’u’llah and foreshadow on
the other the downfall of those powers and principalities that have, either ignored or opposed it -- he can
recognize in them all evidences of the operation of God’s, all-pervasive Will, the shaping of His perfectly
ordered and world-embracing Plan. ...

The Revelation of Baha’u’llah, whose supreme mission is none other but the achievement of this
organic and spiritual unity of the whole body of nations, should, if we be faithful to its implications, be
regarded as signalizing through its advent the coming of age of the entire human race. It should be viewed not
merely as yet another spiritual revival in the everchanging fortunes of mankind, not only as a further stage in a
chain of progressive Revelations, nor even as the culmination of one of a series of recurrent prophetic cycles,
but rather as marking the last and highest stage in the stupendous evolution of man’s collective life on this
planet. The emergence of a world community, the consciousness of world citizenship, the founding of a world
civilization and culture -- all of which must synchronize with the initial stages in the unfoldment of the Golden

\[30\] Baha’i World Centre, Haifa, 1977.

Age of the Baha’i Era -- should, by their very nature, be regarded, as far as this planetary life is concerned, as
the furthermost limits in the organization of human society, though man, as an individual, will, nay must indeed
as a result of such a consummation, continue indefinitely to progress and develop.

That mystic, all-pervasive, yet indefinable change, which we associate with the stage of maturity
inevitable in the life of the individual and the development of the fruit must, if we would correctly apprehend
the utterances of Baha’u’llah, have its counterpart in the evolution of the organization of human society. A
similar stage must sooner or later be attained in the collective life of mankind, producing an even more striking
phenomenon in world relations, and endowing the whole human race with such potentialities of well-being as
shall provide, throughout the succeeding ages, the chief incentive required for the eventual fulfilment of its high
destiny. ...

Humanity, whether viewed in the light of man’s individual conduct or in the existing relationships
between organized communities and nations, has, alas, strayed too far and suffered too great a decline to be
redeemed through the unaided efforts of the best among its recognized rulers and statesmen -- however
disinterested their motives, however concerted their action, however unsparing in their zeal and devotion to its
cause. No scheme which the calculations of the highest statesmanship may yet devise; no doctrine; which the
most distinguished exponents of economic theory may hope to advance; no principle which the most ardent of
moralists may strive to inculcate, can provide, in the last resort, adequate foundations upon which the future of
a distracted world can be built.

No appeal for mutual tolerance which the worldly-wise might raise, however compelling and insistent,
can calm its passions or help restore its vigour. Nor would any general scheme of mere organized international
cooperation, in whatever sphere of human activity, however ingenious in conception, or extensive in scope,
succeed in removing the root cause of the evil that has so rudely upset the equilibrium of present-day society.
Not even, I venture to assert, would the very act of devising the machinery required for the political and
economic unification of the world -- a principle that has been increasingly advocated in recent times -- provide
in itself the antidote against the poison that is steadily undermining the vigour of organized peoples and nations.

What else, might we not confidently affirm, but the unreserved acceptance of the Divine Programme
enunciated, with such simplicity and force as far back as sixty years ago,31 by Baha’u’llah, embodying in its
essentials God’s divinely appointed scheme for the unification of mankind in this age, coupled with an
indomitable conviction in the unfailing efficacy of each and all of its provisions, is eventually capable of
withstanding the forces of internal disintegration which, if unchecked, must needs continue to eat into the vitals
of a despairing society. It is towards this goal -- the goal of a new World Order, Divine in origin, all-embracing
in scope, equitable in principle, challenging in its features -- that a harassed humanity must strive.

To claim to have grasped all the implications of Baha’u’llah’s prodigious scheme for world-wide
human solidarity, or to have fathomed its import, would be presumptuous on the part of even the declared
supporters of His Faith. To attempt to visualize it in all its possibilities, to estimate its future benefits, to picture
its glory, would be premature at even so advanced a stage in the evolution of mankind.

All we can reasonably venture to attempt is to strive to obtain a glimpse of the first streaks of the
promised Dawn that must, in the fullness of time, chase away the gloom that has encircled humanity. All we
can do is to point out, in their broadest outlines, what appear to us to be the guiding principles underlying the
World Order of Baha’u’llah. ...

... Is it not a fact -- and this is the central idea I desire to emphasize -- that the fundamental cause of
this world unrest is attributable, not so much to the consequences of what must sooner or later come to be
regarded as a transitory dislocation in the affairs of a continually changing world, but rather to the failure of

destinies of peoples and nations have been committed, to adjust their systems of economic and political
institutions to the imperative needs of a rapidly evolving age? Are not these intermittent crises that convulse
present-day society due primarily to the lamentable inability of the world’s recognised leaders to read aright the
signs of the times, to rid themselves once for all of their preconceived ideas and fettering creeds, and to reshape
the machinery of their respective governments according to those standards that are implicit in Baha’u’llah’s
supreme declaration of the Oneness of Mankind -- the chief and distinguishing feature of the Faith He
proclaimed? For the principle of the Oneness of Mankind, the corner-stone of Baha’u’llah’s word-embracing
dominion, implies nothing more nor less than the enforcement of His scheme for the unification of the world --
the scheme to which we have already referred. ‘In every Dispensation,’ writes ‘Abdu’l-Baha, ‘the light of
Divine Guidance has been focussed upon one central theme. ... In this wondrous Revelation, this glorious
century, the foundation of the Faith of God and the distinguishing feature of His Law is the consciousness of the
Oneness of Mankind.’

How pathetic indeed are the efforts of those leaders of human institutions who, in utter disregard of the
spirit of the age, are striving to adjust national processes, suited to the ancient days of self-contained nations, to
an age which must either achieve the unity of the world, as adumbrated by Baha’u’llah, or perish. At so critical
an hour in the history of civilization it behoves the leaders of all the nations of the world, great and small,
whether in the East or in the West, whether victors or vanquished, to give heed to the clarion call of Baha’u’llah
and, thoroughly imbued with a sense of world solidarity, the sine qua non of loyalty to His Cause, arise
manfully to carry out in its entirety the one remedial scheme He, the Divine Physician, has prescribed for an
ailing humanity. ...

... Some form of a world super-state must needs be evolved, in whose favour all the nations of the
world will have willingly ceded every claim to make war, certain rights to impose taxation and all rights to
maintain armament v except for purposes of maintaining internal order within their respective dominions. Such
a state will have to include within its orbit an International Executive adequate to enforce supreme and
unchallengeable authority on every recalcitrant member of the commonwealth; a World Parliament whose
members shall be elected by the people in their respective countries and whose election shall be confirmed by
their respective governments; and a Supreme Tribunal whose judgement will have a binding effect even in such
cases where the parties concerned did not voluntarily agree to submit their case to its consideration. A world
community in which all economic barriers will have been permanently demolished and the interdependence of
Capital and Labour definitely recognized; in which the clamour of religious, fanaticism and strife will have
been forever stilled; in which the flame of racial animosity will have been finally extinguished; in which a
single code of international law -- the product of the considered judgement of the world’s federated
representatives -- shall have as its sanction the instant and coercive intervention of the combined forces of the
federated units; and finally a world community in which the fury of a capricious and militant nationalism will
have been transmuted into an abiding consciousness of world citizenship -- such indeed appears, in its broadest
outline, the Order anticipated by Baha’u’llah, an Order that shall come to be regarded as the fairest fruit of a
slowly maturing age.

‘The Tabernacle of Unity,’ Baha’u’llah proclaims in His message to all mankind, ‘has been raised;
regard ye not one another as strangers. ... Of one tree are all ye the fruit and of one bough the leaves. ... The
world is but one country and mankind its citizens. ... Let not a man glory in that he loves his country; let him
rather glory in this, that he loves his kind.’

Let there be no misgivings as to the animating purpose of the world-wide Law of Baha’u’llah. Far
from aiming at the subversion of the existing foundations of society, it seeks to broaden its basis, to remould its
institutions in a matter consonant with the needs of an ever-changing world. It can conflict with no legitimate
allegiances, nor can it undermine essential loyalties. Its purpose is neither to stifle the flame of a sane and
intelligent patriotism in

men’s hearts, nor to abolish the system of national autonomy so essential if the evils of excessive centralization
are to be avoided. It does not ignore, nor does it attempt to suppress, the diversity of ethnical origins, of climate,
of history, of language and tradition, of thought and habit, that differentiate the peoples and nations of the
world. It calls for a wider loyalty, for a larger aspiration than any that has animated the human race. It insists
upon the subordination of national impulses and interests to the imperative claims of a unified world. It
repudiates excessive centralization on one hand, and disclaims all attempts at uniformity on the other. Its
watchword is unity in diversity. ...

The call of Baha’u’llah is primarily directed against all forms of provincialism, all insularities and
prejudices. If long-cherished ideals and time-honoured institutions, if certain social assumptions and religious
formulae have ceased to promote the welfare of the generality of mankind, if they no longer minister to the
needs of a continually evolving humanity, let them be swept away and relegated to the limbo of obsolescent and
forgotten doctrines. Why should these, in a world subject to the immutable law of change and decay, be exempt
from the deterioration that must needs overtake every human institution? For legal standards, political and
economic theories are solely designed to safeguard the interests of humanity as a whole, and not humanity to be
crucified for the preservation of the integrity of any particular law or doctrine.

Let there be no mistake. The principle of the Oneness of Mankind -- the pivot round which all the
teachings of Baha’u’llah revolve -- is no mere outburst of ignorant emotionalism or an expression of vague and
pious hope. Its appeal is not to be merely identified with a reawakening of the spirit of brotherhood and good-
will among men, nor does it aim solely at the fostering of harmonious co-operation among individual peoples
and nations. Its implications are deeper, its claims greater than any which the Prophets of old were allowed to
advance. Its message is applicable not only to the individual, but concerns itself primarily with the nature of
those essential relationships that must bind all the states and nations as members of one human family. It does
not constitute merely the enunciation of an ideal, but stands inseparably associated with an institution adequate
to embody its truth, demonstrate its validity, and perpetuate its influence. It implies an organic change in the
structure of present-day society, a change such as the world has not yet experienced. It constitutes a challenge,
at once bold and universal, to outworn shibboleths of national creeds -- creeds that have had their day and
which must, in the ordinary course of events as shaped and controlled by Providence, give way to a new gospel,
fundamentally different from, and infinitely superior to, what the world has already conceived. It calls for no
less than the reconstruction and the demilitarization of the whole civilized world -- a world organically unified
in all the essential aspects of its life, its political machinery, its spiritual aspiration, its trade and finance, its
script and language, and yet infinite in the diversity of the national characteristics of its federated units.

It represents the consummation of human evolution -- an evolution that has had its earliest beginnings
in the birth of family life, its subsequent development in the achievement of tribal solidarity, leading in turn to
the constitution of the city-state, and expanding later into the institution of independent and sovereign nations.

The principle of the Oneness of Mankind, as proclaimed by Baha’u’llah, carries with it no more and no
less than a solemn assertion that attainment to this final stage in this stupendous evolution is not only necessary
but inevitable, that its realization is fast approaching, and that nothing short of a power that is born of God can
succeed in establishing it. ...

Who knows that for so exalted a conception to take shape a suffering more intense than any it has yet
experienced will have to be inflicted upon humanity? Could anything less than the fire of a civil war with all its
violence and vicissitudes -- a war that nearly rent the great American Republic -- have welded the states, not
only into a Union of independent units, but into a Nation, in spite of all the ethnic differences that characterized
its component parts? That so fundamental a revolution, involving such far-reaching changes in the structure of

society, can be achieved through the ordinary processes of diplomacy and education seems highly improbable.
We have but to turn our gaze to humanity’s blood-stained history to realize that nothing short of intense mental
as well as physical agony has been able to precipitate those epoch-making changes that constitute the greatest
landmarks in the history of human civilization. ...

Great and far-reaching as have been those changes in the past; they cannot appear, when viewed in
their proper perspective, except as subsidiary adjustments preluding that transformation of unparalleled majesty
and scope which humanity is in this age bound to undergo. That the forces of a world catastrophe can alone
precipitate such a new phase of human thought is, alas, becoming increasingly apparent. That nothing short of
the fire of a severe ordeal, unparalleled in its intensity, can fuse and weld the discordant entities that constitute
the elements of present-day civilization, into the integral components of the world commonwealth of the future,
is a truth which future events, will increasingly demonstrate.

The prophetic voice of Baha’u’llah warning, in the concluding passages of The Hidden Words, the
peoples of the world that an unforeseen calamity is following them and that grievous retribution awaiteth them
throws indeed a lurid light upon the immediate fortunes of sorrowing humanity. Nothing but a fiery ordeal, out
of which humanity will emerge, chastened and prepared, can succeed in implanting that sense of responsibility
which the leaders of a new-born age must arise to shoulder.

I would again direct your attention to those ominous words of Baha’u’llah which I have already
quoted: ‘And when the appointed hour is come, there shall suddenly appear that which shall cause the limbs of
mankind to quake.’...

One word more in conclusion. The proclamation of the Oneness of Mankind -- the head corner-stone
of Baha’u’llah’s all-embracing dominion -- can under no circumstances be compared with such expressions of
pious hope as have been uttered in the past. His is not merely a call which He raised, alone and unaided, in the
face of the relentless and combined opposition of two of the most powerful Oriental potentates of His day --
while Himself an exile and prisoner in their hands. It implies at once a warning and a promise -- a warning that
in it lies the sole means for the salvation of a greatly suffering world, a promise that its realization is at hand.

Uttered at a time when its possibility had not yet been seriously envisaged in any part of the world, it
has, by virtue of that celestial potency which the Spirit of Baha’u’llah has breathed into it, come at last to be
regarded, by an increasing number of thoughtful men, not only as an approaching possibility, but as the
necessary outcome of the forces now operating in the world.

Surely the world, contracted and transformed into a single highly complex organism by the marvellous
progress achieved in the realm of physical science, by the world-wide expansion of commerce and industry, and
struggling, under the pressure of world economic forces, amidst the pitfalls of a materialistic civilization, stands
in dire need of a restatement of the Truth underlying all the Revelations of the past in a language suited to its
essential requirements. And what voice other than that of Baha’u’llah -- the Mouthpiece of God for this age -- is
capable of effecting a transformation of society as radical as that which He has already accomplished in the
hearts of those men and women, so diversified and seemingly irreconcilable, who constitute the body of His
declared followers throughout the world?

That such a mighty conception is fast budding out in the minds of men, that voices are being raised in
its support, that its salient features must fast crystallize in the consciousness of those who are in authority, few
indeed can doubt. That its modest beginnings have already taken shape in the world-wide Administration with
which the adherents of the Faith of Baha’u’llah stand associated only those whose hearts are tainted by
prejudice can fail to perceive. ...
