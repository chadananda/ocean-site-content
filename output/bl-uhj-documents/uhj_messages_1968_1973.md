Forward  
  
    This volume is a sequel to _Wellspring of Guidance_ which was published in 1969. It comprises communications from The Universal House of Justice spanning the period of that institution's second five-year term, Ridván 1968 to Ridván 1973. Beginning with the announcement of the results of the election at the second International Convention, this collection of selected messages portrays Bahá'í developments during the latter half of the Nine Year Plan in addition to conveying the guidance, advice, and comments of The House of Justice on a variety of questions confronting the Bahá'í world community at various stages of the Plan.  
  
    The establishment of the Continental Boards of Counselors, the commemorations of the centenary of Bahá'u'lláh's arrival in the Holy Land, of the fiftieth anniversary of 'Abdu'l-Bahá's passing and of the centenary of the martyrdom of the Purest Branch, the completion of the synopsis and codification of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the adoption of the Constitution of The Universal House of Justice, the purchase of the Mazra'ih Mansion, the dedication of the Panama Temple, the holding of a series of eight continental and oceanic conferences between August 1970 and September 1971, the decision to build the seat of The Universal House of Justice, the attainment of consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations — all indelible landmarks of the Nine Year Plan — are treated in this volume.  
  
    In general, the messages are addressed to the Bahá'ís of the world, to National Spiritual Assemblies, or to believers

gathered at special events. Two messages are addressed jointly to Continental Boards of Counselors and National Spiritual Assemblies. One is addressed to Bahá'í youth in every land. A letter to an individual, appearing under the title "Comments on the Guardianship and The Universal House of Justice," is included because of the general interest of its subject matter to all Bahá'ís.  
  
    The reader will readily observe some differences in the presentation of the book's contents: The messages have been printed as complete documents and therefore include addresses, salutations, and complimentary closes as in the originals. A subject heading has been provided for each communication by the editors but subheadings have not been inserted as has been the practice in the past. Several items have been extracted from _Wellspring of Guidance_ to make this volume chronologically complete.  
  
    Except for three messages, all these communications have appeared in part or in whole in the various Bahá'í journals. It is, therefore, for the easier reference and greater use of the Bahá'í community that they are now gathered in this anthology.
