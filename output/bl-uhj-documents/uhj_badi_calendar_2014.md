10 July 2014

To the Bahá’ís of the World

Dearly loved Friends,

The setting of the sun on 20 March 2015 will signalize the end of the year 171, the close of the
ninth Váḥid of the first Kull-i-Shay’ of the Bahá’í Era. We call upon the Bahá’ís of the East and West
to adopt, on that auspicious occasion, the provisions that will unite them in the common
implementation of the Badí‘ calendar.

In keeping with the principle governing the gradual unfoldment and progressive application of
the Teachings, the provisions of the Badí‘ calendar have been set forth over time. The Báb
introduced the calendar and its broad pattern of periods and cycles, months and days. Bahá’u’lláh
provided essential clarifications and additions. Aspects were elucidated by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and
arrangements for its adoption in the West were put in place at the direction of Shoghi Effendi, as
described in the volumes of The Bahá’í World. Still, ambiguities surrounding some Islamic and
Gregorian dates, as well as difficulties in the correlation of historical observances and astronomical
events with explicit statements in the Text, left certain issues unresolved. When responding to
questions concerning the calendar, both ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi left these matters to the
Universal House of Justice. Of its many features, three require clarification for the calendar’s
uniform application: the means for the determination of Naw-Rúz, the accommodation of the lunar
character of the Twin Holy Birthdays within the solar year, and the fixing of the dates of the Holy
Days within the Badí‘ calendar.

“The Festival of Naw-Rúz falleth on the day that the sun entereth the sign of Aries,” Bahá’u’lláh
explains in His Most Holy Book, “even should this occur no more than one minute before sunset.”
However, details have, until now, been left undefined. We have decided that Ṭihrán, the birthplace
of the Abhá Beauty, will be the spot on the earth that will serve as the standard for determining, by
means of astronomical computations from reliable sources, the moment of the vernal equinox in the
northern hemisphere and thereby the day of Naw-Rúz for the Bahá’í world.

The Festivals of the Twin Birthdays, the Birth of the Báb and the Birth of Bahá’u’lláh, have, in
the East, been traditionally observed according to their correspondence to the first and second days
of Muḥarram in the Islamic calendar. “These two days are accounted as one in the sight of God”,
Bahá’u’lláh affirms. Yet, a letter written on behalf of the Guardian states, “In the future, no doubt all
of the Holy Days will follow the Solar calendar, and provisions be made as to how the Twin
Festivals will be celebrated universally.” How to satisfy the intrinsic lunar character of these blessed
Days within the context of a solar calendar has hitherto been unanswered. We have decided that
they will now be observed on the first and the second day following the occurrence of the eighth
new moon after Naw-Rúz, as determined in advance by astronomical tables using Ṭihrán as the
point of reference. This will result in the observance of the Twin Birthdays moving, year to year,
within the months of Mashíyyat, ‘Ilm, and Qudrat of the Badí‘ calendar, or from mid-October to
mid-November according to the Gregorian calendar. Next year, the Birth of the Báb will occur on 10
Qudrat and the Birth of Bahá’u’lláh on 11 Qudrat. With joy and eager anticipation, we look to the
upcoming bicentennial anniversaries of the Birth of Bahá’u’lláh and the Birth of the Báb, in 174 and
176 B.E., respectively, which the entire Bahá’í world will celebrate according to a common calendar.

The dates of the remaining Holy Days will be fixed within the solar calendar in accordance with
explicit statements of Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi; we have decided to set aside
certain discrepancies in the historical record. The dates are: Naw-Rúz, 1 Bahá; the Festival of Riḍván,
13 Jalál to 5 Jamál; the Declaration of the Báb, 8 ‘Aẓamat; the Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh, 13 ‘Aẓamat;

the Martyrdom of the Báb, 17 Raḥmat; the Day of the Covenant, 4 Qawl; and the Ascension of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 6 Qawl.

Unless specifically abrogated by these new provisions, previous guidance and clarifications
pertaining to the calendar and the observance of the Nineteen Day Feast and Holy Days remain
binding, such as the beginning of the day at sunset, the suspension of work, and the hours at which
certain Holy Days are commemorated. In future, a change in circumstances may well require
additional measures.

It will be evident from the decisions delineated that Bahá’ís of both East and West will find some
elements of the calendar to be different from those to which they have been accustomed. The
alignment of the dates of the Badí‘ calendar with other calendars will shift depending on the
occurrence of Naw-Rúz. The number of days of Ayyám-i-Há will vary according to the timing of the
vernal equinox in successive years; the year commencing on Naw-Rúz 172 B.E. will include four
such days. A table prepared at the Bahá’í World Centre that sets out the dates for Naw-Rúz and the
Twin Holy Birthdays covering half a century will be provided to all National Spiritual Assemblies in
due course.

The adoption of a new calendar in each dispensation is a symbol of the power of Divine
Revelation to reshape human perception of material, social, and spiritual reality. Through it, sacred
moments are distinguished, humanity’s place in time and space reimagined, and the rhythm of life
recast. Next Naw-Rúz will mark yet another historic step in the manifestation of the unity of the
people of Bahá and the unfoldment of Bahá’u’lláh’s World Order.

Ayyám-i-Há are given in Table A.

                             THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE

DEPARTMENT OF THE SECRETARIAT

24 November 2014

Transmitted by email: [deleted]
Dr. [deleted]
U.S.A.

Dear Bahá’í Friends,

The Universal House of Justice was pleased to receive your email letter dated 18 August
2014 conveying your gratitude for its announcement concerning the implementation of the
Badí‘ calendar and requesting clarification regarding the date for the Twin Holy Birthdays
in 2015 set out in the table sent to all National Spiritual Assemblies. We have been asked to
respond as follows.

The question may be more easily resolved if you think in terms of the Bahá’í dates,
not the Gregorian ones, given that the Bahá’í day begins at sunset. As you mention, the
eighth new moon following Naw-Rúz occurs after sunset on 11 November 2015, the Bahá’í
date for which is 9 Qudrat 172. This refers to the day of the moon’s conjunction with the sun,
that is, the moon’s dark phase. As stated in the House of Justice’s letter of 10 July 2014 to the
Bahá’ís of the World, the Twin Holy Birthdays are to be observed “on the first and the second
day following the occurrence of the eighth new moon after Naw-Rúz, as determined in advance
by astronomical tables using Ṭihrán as the point of reference.” Since the eighth new moon falls
on 9 Qudrat, the Twin Birthdays are to be celebrated on the two days following that day, which
are 10 and 11 Qudrat 172, coinciding with 13 and 14 November of the Gregorian calendar in
2015\.

The method for determining the lunar event associated with the Twin Birthdays for
the Bahá’í calendar is different than the method used to mark the start of a new month in
the Islamic calendar in that it is not associated with the observance of the light of the first
crescent. Although, as you note, the first day of the Islamic month, which begins with the
appearance of the first crescent, may fall on 21 March 2015, the astronomical new moon,
the moon’s dark phase, falls on 20 March, which is 19 ‘Alá’ 171.
