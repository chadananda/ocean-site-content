The National Spiritual Assembly of

the Bahá’ís of the United States

Dear Bahá’í Friends,
1\.1       As indicated in our message to you dated 21 July 1.1

> 2005, the Universal House of Justice was pleased to
> learn of your interest in drawing upon the experi-
> ence of the Bahá’í world in meeting the administrative
> challenges associated with large-scale expansion.
> At its request, the International Teaching Centre has
> prepared the enclosed statement summarizing the les-
> sons learned to date in this regard, which, it is hoped,
> will assist you in your consultations on the subject.
> In reviewing the points examined in this thoughtful
> document, the House of Justice has taken the oppor-
> tunity to consider a number of issues related to the
> efforts of your community to pursue the aim of the
> Five Year Plan. Deliberate steps have been taken by
> your Assembly in recent months to focus the ener-
> gies of the friends on the two movements that lie at
> the heart of the Plan, and the prospects for further
> impressive achievements by Rid.ván 2006 look bright.
> To reinforce these positive developments and to assist
> you in extending the scope of your determined efforts,
> the House of Justice has instructed us to convey to you
> the following comments.
1\.2        The promising pattern of action emerging in 1.2

> clusters throughout the world integrates individual ini-
> tiative and community endeavor in order to embrace an
> ever-wider circle of people and teach receptive souls.

This pattern appears wherever a sizable number of

individuals who are moving through the sequence of
> institute courses make a conscious effort to translate
> what they are learning into action, undertaking spe-
> ciﬁc acts of service that challenge them to draw upon
> the knowledge and insights they are gaining and to
> sharpen the skills and abilities they are developing
> through the courses. One of the most noteworthy out-
> comes of the institute courses is the emergence of an
> ever-increasing number of tutors who, having them-
> selves studied the courses and struggled to walk a path
> of service, engage others in the study of the sequence,
> instilling in them the same desire to arise and serve. In
> this way, a broad base is laid for universal participation,
> which remains one of the most fundamental goals of the
> Bahá’í community. You have, yourselves, witnessed this
> development in the few clusters that have reached an
> advanced stage of growth.
1\.3       You have, likewise, observed how the conditions thus 1.3

> created in such clusters have made it possible to launch
> intensive programs of growth, in which large numbers
> of friends eagerly participate in the learning that takes
> place through successive cycles of activity seeking to
> integrate well-coordinated collective action with effec-
> tive individual initiative. And you are equally aware of
> how interaction among three entities—the institute, the
> Auxiliary Boards, and the Area Teaching Committee—
> in close collaboration with responsive Local Spiritual
> Assemblies, can help carry the friends from one cycle to
> another and accelerate the learning process.
1\.4       Having come to a good understanding of the 1.4

> dynamics of the development of human resources, the
> advancement of learning through progressive cycles
> of a growth program, and the requisite administra-
> tive action by institutions and agencies involved at the
> cluster level, you now need to help the American Bahá’í
> community focus its energies increasingly on fostering

them. If some two to three hundred clusters were to
> achieve the level of activity already reached in the
> Austin and Broward clusters, the present rate of enroll-
> ments could multiply tenfold. This is not an abstract
> possibility, but a practical objective that lies well within
> your grasp.
1\.5       Commitment to establishing sound intensive pro- 1.5

> grams of growth in a realistic number of clusters across
> the nation should provide the basis for addressing the
> many questions associated with the necessary adjust-
> ment of your administrative and ﬁnancial affairs to meet
> the challenges of massive expansion. The situation today
> is not unlike the one you faced in the 1970s when, in the
> ferment of tumultuous social conditions, and as a result
> of fresh approaches to teaching, the membership of the
> American Bahá’í community tripled in only a few years.
> The demands of growth necessitated a dramatic change
> in the administration of the community, and a vastly
> augmented National Center emerged, one that served as
> a hub for a vibrant network of committees, departments,
> and programs. This administrative arrangement, com-
> plemented by a few modest enhancements, has served
> the community admirably for over three decades. The
> Universal House of Justice feels that an effort of similar
> magnitude may well be needed to put in place admin-
> istrative mechanisms that will support the work of the
> community during the next stage of its development. In
> considering the nature of these mechanisms, you will
> want to bear certain points in mind.
1\.6       With learning about the nature of growth unfold- 1.6

> ing so rapidly at the grassroots, programs related to the
> expansion and consolidation of the Faith can best be
> managed at the regional or cluster level to ensure they
> evolve in accordance with practical experience. The
> efforts of national agencies should be examined to deter-
> mine whether they overlap with the responsibilities

granted to agencies at those levels. Where redundancies
> occur, the programs of national agencies may need to
> be modiﬁed signiﬁcantly, or perhaps be eliminated
> altogether, so as to avoid creating confusion, diffusing
> focus, or dividing participation among an array of pro-
> grams which, no matter how valuable in themselves,
> would end up at cross purposes, competing for the lim-
> ited time and energies of the believers.
1\.7       Consider, for example, the multiplication of chil- 1.7

> dren’s classes. You have already made modiﬁcations to
> your institutional arrangements for this purpose, and
> these must be carefully monitored to ensure efﬁciency
> and effectiveness. The regional institutes are charged
> with responsibility for the implementation and man-
> agement of the classes, and they require a wide degree
> of latitude to train the teachers, deploy resources,
> and collaborate with Local Spiritual Assemblies. The
> work of the regional institutes is being complemented
> by a national effort to provide curriculum and make
> available resource persons. However, if collaboration
> between the institutes and the National Children’s Edu-
> cation and Research Center is not close, or if teachers in
> the clusters are directed from the national level, bypass-
> ing the institutes, the methodical expansion of classes
> for children, including the outreach to the wider com-
> munity, will be severely impeded.
1\.8       Likewise, the spiritual empowerment of junior 1.8

> youth and their older peers is best addressed by an
> institute working in the context of an intensive pro-
> gram of growth. An example is the Project Badi in
> Florida which involved some forty youth during
> July of this year. In a setting of this kind, training
> and practice are combined, enhancing the capacities
> of the youth. Not only do they contribute directly
> to the activities of a cycle of a growth program, but
> they return to their home communities transformed

by their summer experience, eager to serve in their
> schools and clusters throughout the year. This expe-
> rience, if repeated over a series of summers, could
> well equip youth with the knowledge, skills, and atti-
> tudes required for a lifetime of effective action in the
> teaching ﬁeld. Should the number of such projects
> multiply along with intensive programs of growth, it
> is not unreasonable to assume that the youth will take
> their rightful place in the forefront of the processes of
> the Plan, attract their peers to the Cause, and revital-
> ize the community with an inﬂux of young people. In
> such an effort, the basic sequence of institute courses
> constitutes the curriculum for the youth. Though cer-
> tainly they will broaden their study of the Faith in a
> number of other ways, a parallel national program for
> their education would sap the strength of grassroots
> endeavors and leave them ineffectual.
1.9       Plans to reach specific populations—Hispanics, 1.9

> Muslims, etc.—with the Message of Bahá’u’lláh and
> bring them into the ranks of His followers, too, are most
> fruitful when they are administered and directed at
> the cluster level, close to where the learning is taking
> place. Such an approach seems to be conﬁrmed by your
> experience with the national media campaign, the effec-
> tiveness of which improved markedly when it became
> more closely aligned with plans of action at the level of
> the cluster.
1\.10       While certain national programs may require signif- 1.10

> icant modiﬁcation or, quite likely, be brought to a close,
> others may need to be reconceptualized so that they can
> better reinforce the processes unfolding at the cluster
> level. The work of agencies such as the Ofﬁce of Educa-
> tion and Schools or the Ofﬁce of Assembly Development
> may be enhanced by this kind of a review. Your delib-
> erations in this respect may also need to extend to the
> mandate of the National Teaching Committee. Since the

establishment of the Regional Bahá’í Councils several
> years ago, your National Teaching Committee has
> conducted a range of formal studies on issues pertaining
> to the role of religion in the wider community, as well as
> on certain aspects of Bahá’í community life. In addition
> to this, however, increasing efforts have been made over
> the past year to evaluate the results of the Five Year Plan
> through case studies and the detailed analysis of data
> of various kinds. As the National Teaching Committee
> strengthens in this way its capacity to systematize the
> lessons being learned through the action and reﬂection
> of the friends in communities scattered across the coun-
> try, it will be able to offer the knowledge gained to the
> institutions at all levels and lend further impetus to the
> movement of clusters nationwide.
1\.11       All of this, of course, has implications for the dispo- 1.11

> sition of your ﬁnancial resources. The allocations you
> have provided this year to the Councils and regional
> institutes are highly commendable. Despite contribu-
> tions made directly by the friends for the work at this
> level, where self-reliance in support of the material
> needs of activities and projects is most meritorious, the
> demands placed upon the National Fund are likely to
> increase further as the number of intensive programs
> of growth multiplies signiﬁcantly. Yet, as noted in your
> comments to the Counsellors that accompanied your
> proposed budget for 2005–6, most of your resources
> are directed towards ﬁxed expenses. As you consider
> the implications for change inherent in the structural
> adjustments discussed above, you will no doubt ﬁnd
> the practical means to ensure the uninterrupted ﬂow of
> funds required at the grassroots.
1\.12       The American Bahá’í community stands at an impor- 1.12

> tant historical juncture. The insights emerging from its
> own experience, as well as the entire Bahá’í world,
> endow it with the capacity to reach unprecedented

levels of activity. The burden falls on you and the
Counsellors to exercise wise leadership to ensure this
capacity is fully developed. The Universal House of Jus-
tice will offer continued prayers at the Sacred Threshold
on your behalf.

ENCLOSURE

Impact of Growth on Administration Processes

Prepared by the International Teaching Centre

July 2005

2\.1       The dramatic progress achieved on all continents 2.1

> in the course of the Five Year Plan has been reﬂected in
> many aspects of the life of the Bahá’í community. The
> training institute process has continued to enhance the
> capacity of an increasing number of believers to pro-
> mote the processes of expansion and consolidation.
> The enhanced sense of ownership and enthusiasm thus
> generated, reﬂected in a marked increase in individual
> initiative, has been especially evident in advanced clus-
> ters where the renewed teaching fervour of the friends
> is directed towards intensive programmes of growth.
2\.2       One of the welcome results of this new vibrancy is 2.2

> that there is a growing contingent of believers involved
> in the work of the Cause, serving in numerous capacities
> within the framework of the Plan. Meanwhile an expand-
> ing community of interest is challenging the Bahá’í
> community to re-conceptualise its boundaries and cater
> to the requirements of an ever-swelling body of individ-
> uals walking together the path towards Bahá’u’lláh. The
> progress made has been reinforced by the emergence of
> a new culture of growth in the community.
2\.3       As these developments have continued at an accel- 2.3

> erating pace, several national communities have taken
> steps to reframe their administrative arrangements,
> so as to align them with the new requirements. Below
> is a review of some of the most salient aspects of the

developments which impinge on the administration of
> the processes of growth. This review reﬂects the expe-
> riences of communities in the advance guard of these
> processes. Whereas in some instances the changes have
> been relatively minor and adjustments easily made, in
> other cases they have necessitated a major rethinking of
> structures and practices.

> Administering the process of growth
> at the cluster level
2\.4       With the division of countries into small geographic 2.4

> areas, the cluster construct has created a new arena
> within which the teaching work can be organised on a
> manageable scale. Large-scale expansion in the past had
> proven difﬁcult to sustain. Whilst this was principally
> owing to lack of a systematic process for raising human
> resources, there was also limited experience with man-
> aging the process of growth at the grass roots. In this
> context, the learning that has been achieved about the
> administration of growth at the cluster level constitutes
> one of the major accomplishments in the current Plan.
2\.5       In its 9 January 2001 letter, the Universal House of 2.5

> Justice placed the locus of the cluster planning work on
> three entities at the cluster level: “The implementation
> of such a programme will require the close collabora-
> tion of the institute, the Auxiliary Board members and
> their assistants, and an Area Teaching Committee.” In
> advanced clusters these entities are directly focused on
> the planning and execution of teaching plans, ensuring
> that the victories are immediately consolidated, learn-
> ing is captured, and appropriate adjustments quickly
> made. Taken together, the three agencies constitute a
> strong infrastructure, making it possible for many deci-
> sions related to the process of growth to be made by
> those most intimately involved in their execution.

2.6       As the speciﬁc responsibilities of agencies operating 2.6

> at the cluster level became deﬁned by the House of Jus-
> tice, in several countries detailed documents that set
> out the scheme of coordination involving these agen-
> cies and their ancillary arms have been developed.
> Often modelled on the ﬁrst such paper that was devel-
> oped in India, these have assisted in clarifying roles
> and removing ambiguities. These documents have also
> formed the basis in these countries of the training and
> orientation of the members of the agencies, necessar-
> ily an ongoing process which continues to be reﬁned in
> light of experience.
2\.7       One instance of the training required by the Area 2.7

> Teaching Committee occurred in an advanced cluster
> in Mongolia. There, the sharp increase in new believ-
> ers and the complexity of managing the consequent
> rise in consolidation activities highlighted the urgent
> need for training of the members of the Committee as
> well as of members of the Local Spiritual Assemblies
> in the cluster. The training included a range of impor-
> tant organisational capabilities—data collection and
> analysis, team building, and computer skills. The col-
> laboration of the Committee, the institute coordinators,
> and the Auxiliary Board members has enabled this
> cluster to scale remarkable heights in expansion, con-
> solidation, and human resource development.
2\.8       A critically important aspect which cannot be 2.8

> deferred for long is the signiﬁcant investment of time
> required from the cluster agencies, in particular the
> training institute coordinator and the secretary of the
> Area Teaching Committee—occasionally referred to
> as the cluster development facilitator. Experience is
> showing that where the number of core activities, the
> various campaigns related to the teaching work, and
> the tasks related to the collection of statistics, among
> other duties, reach a certain level of complexity,

part- and eventually full-time workers are required. In
> such instances, institute coordinators and development
> facilitators, functioning with increasing effectiveness,
> are proving indispensable to the greater mobilisation of
> the rank and ﬁle of the believers and the continuity of
> teaching and consolidation efforts.
2.9       The question is not initially related to whether such 2.9

> staff are remunerated—in many clusters the services
> of volunteers in these posts are being effectively har-
> nessed. Rather, the issue is one of recognising that the
> management of the processes of growth requires inten-
> sive effort on the part of a dedicated team of individuals
> functioning in clearly deﬁned spheres at the grass roots.
> Eventually, of course, it will not be possible for the
> work to be carried out on a purely voluntary basis and,
> in time, individuals will need to be employed. Where
> remuneration is required, new challenges arise related
> to the use of the funds, and the way in which they are
> to be generated within the cluster and augmented from
> outside as necessary. Another challenge is ensuring
> that a ﬂexible approach is adopted to allow for various
> employment arrangements.
2\.10       Another important consideration is that the sizeable 2.10

> enlargement of the community of interest is proving a
> spur to the friends and institutions to adopt approaches
> that minimise the demarcation between Bahá’ís and
> non-Bahá’ís. As core activities attract an increasing
> number of participants, the challenge is to meet their
> needs by making them feel at home within a Bahá’í
> environment. To administer this new element of the
> community requires intimate knowledge of their needs
> and application of systematic attention. It involves
> regularly communicating with them, engaging them in
> a single discourse, readily utilising their services and
> learning how to guide them to an ever increasing com-
> mitment to the Cause. All this is greatly facilitated by

having agencies that can function at the cluster level,
> for this is the arrowhead of learning about all aspects
> of the growth process. The cluster agencies can put in
> place the necessary elements such as creating a special
> newsletter aimed at the community of interest, engag-
> ing these new friends in the work of the cluster, or
> assisting Local Spiritual Assemblies to play their own
> part in this regard.

Involvement of Local Spiritual Assemblies
2\.11       The role of the Local Spiritual Assembly is, like that 2.11

> of all other institutions, an evolutionary one, which will
> develop in relation to the processes of growth. Although
> observations in this area are still rather preliminary, cer-
> tain broad conclusions are already discernible. Where
> Local Assemblies have acquired the new vision of
> growth and adjusted to the requirements of operat-
> ing within the context of the cluster, they have greatly
> enhanced the teaching work. Conversely, where there
> has been resistance to the new realities, the process of
> growth has been adversely affected.
2\.12       It is instructive to note the effective role that Local 2.12

> Spiritual Assemblies have played in many clusters. In
> several countries where Assemblies had a low level
> of functioning, a signiﬁcant revival of Assemblies in
> advanced clusters has been observed. The believers are
> taking responsibility for the election of their Assembly
> and, once formed, the Assembly is assuming greater
> responsibility for the affairs of the Cause than ever
> before.
2\.13       In other instances, particularly in the context of 2.13

> intensive programmes of growth, Local Assemblies
> with a high level of functioning are rising to the chal-
> lenges created by the programme. Such Assemblies have
> effectively reinforced the cluster plan formulated by the

cluster agencies and assumed responsibility for certain
> elements of the endeavour within their own area. Given
> that the geographic scope of the planning involved
> often extends to several localities, a useful practice in
> the initial stages of development has been for the cluster
> agencies to share the proposed plan with the Local Spir-
> itual Assemblies in the area. This approach can enhance
> the Assemblies’ ability to lend their support to the pro-
> gramme, and encourages them to take steps to reinforce
> it in their localities. An example of where this is happen-
> ing in many instances is the United States.
2\.14       As teaching efforts and core activities have multi- 2.14

> plied, Local Assemblies have been thrilled to see the
> opportunities created for serving the wider population.
> For example, an Assembly in whose area children’s
> classes have multiplied in various neighbourhoods is
> delighted to know that the community in its charge is
> able to administer to a greater number of the children of
> the locality than it was ever possible before. Yet beyond
> the increased capacity for outreach, the positive effect
> on the quality of Bahá’í community life has also been
> reported and is reﬂected in the enhanced quality of its
> internal processes.
2\.15       These conclusions are drawn in part from a sur- 2.15

> vey conducted by the International Teaching Centre
> in about ﬁfty advanced clusters throughout the world.
> The study which assessed the impact of the process
> of growth on several aspects of Bahá’í community life
> identiﬁed that 90 per cent of the surveyed clusters had
> experienced improvements in the Nineteen Day Feast,
> with nearly two-thirds of them also recording a rise
> in participation levels. Insights gained from conduct-
> ing devotional gatherings are increasingly reﬂected
> in the spiritual programme of the Feast. According to
> the survey, even the consultative processes at all levels
> in the community—including Assembly meetings—

have improved in efﬁcacy, becoming more purposeful,
> united, and focused. It has also been observed that in
> many instances contributions to the Bahá’í Fund have
> been positively impacted as levels of commitment and
> consciousness about its spiritual signiﬁcance have
> increased. These successes are owed to the effect of the
> institute process which, fostering a deep spiritual trans-
> formation, has proven more effective in dealing with
> great numbers of people than most efforts at commu-
> nity and Spiritual Assembly development.
2\.16        The survey indicated that the most signiﬁcant ini- 2.16

> tial contribution of Local Assemblies to the processes
> of growth was providing encouragement to the believ-
> ers. This was particularly effective when an expansion
> of vision had resulted from the participation of Assem-
> bly members in the institute process as well as the study
> of Five Year Plan documents. Interactions with the clus-
> ter agencies were also identiﬁed as enabling Assemblies
> to make effective contributions. Such interactions often
> occur at the cluster level in the context of particular plans
> of action. Another effective approach to building unity
> of vision and action has been the convening of confer-
> ences for Local Assembly members. This approach has
> been employed in Canada where such gatherings held
> at the regional or cluster level by Regional Bahá’í Coun-
> cils have done much to assist Local Assemblies to realign
> their administrative processes and priorities.
2\.17       Beyond these considerations, the leadership role of 2.17

> the Spiritual Assemblies—be they national or local—
> is of profound importance. It has been observed in
> many clusters that the processes of growth are greatly
> enhanced where this leadership role is exercised
> through the Assemblies’ constant effort to maintain the
> vision of growth before the believers, allowing for the
> two essential movements to impact priorities, avoid-
> ing unnecessary distractions, providing the necessary

resources, and reinforcing the plans and initiatives at
> the cluster level. Further, the dynamic force of individ-
> ual example as the members of Assemblies themselves
> become personally involved in the cluster activities,
> actively supporting the efforts of the cluster agencies,
> is imperative.

Decentralisation and Regional Bahá’í Councils
2\.18       Given the far-reaching developments occurring 2.18

> at the level of the cluster and as more intensive pro-
> grammes of growth are launched, decentralisation of
> administrative processes becomes ever more impor-
> tant. Accordingly, the strengthening of Regional Bahá’í
> Councils, where these exist, takes on added signiﬁcance.
> The main consideration is related to the devolution of
> the decision making process to the appropriate level
> of the Bahá’í administration. In practice, this principle
> applies both to the devolution of decision making by
> National Spiritual Assemblies to the regional level, and
> by the Regional Bahá’í Council to the cluster level. It is
> increasingly evident that where the framework of the
> Five Year Plan has been well understood by Regional
> Councils, through their stewardship of the expansion
> and consolidation processes in their regions, the aim of
> a signiﬁcant advance in the process of entry by troops
> is becoming realised.
2\.19       One approach to the question of decentralisation 2.19

> would be to focus on the relationship of the Councils
> with the Counsellors, the National Assembly, national
> committees, and ofﬁces of the National Centre, look-
> ing at the hierarchy of the various entities involved.
> However, more relevant to the relation between
> decentralisation and the aim of advancing the process
> of entry by troops would be a consideration of whether
> the administrative structures are consistent with and
> conducive to growth at the cluster level, particularly

large-scale growth. What many countries are learning is
> to construct the vision of administrative processes that
> affect growth from the cluster upwards, asking at each
> stage what arrangements will best advance the process
> of entry by troops in this new arena of action.
2\.20       What is being learnt, then, is that an effective admin- 2.20

> istration with regard to the teaching work is one that
> aims to release the power of individual initiative, provid-
> ing the ﬂow of resources and freedom of operation to the
> coordinating structures at the cluster level. Indeed, one
> national community which is undertaking a wide-rang-
> ing review of its administrative processes, India, began
> by considering the reality at the level of the cluster, and
> considered what processes would most effectively ensure
> the promotion of growth. For this purpose, administra-
> tion was conceptualised as constituting the channels to
> facilitate a series of necessary ﬂows—ﬂows of guidance,
> direction, encouragement, human resources, literature,
> and information, including statistics.
2\.21       The challenge of gathering accurate statistics is 2.21

> being addressed in many countries through the applica-
> tion of the Statistical Report Programme (SRP) devised
> by the Department of Statistics at the Bahá’í World Cen-
> tre. What this programme facilitates is the gathering
> and analysis of key data that enable an accurate and
> timely picture of the development of the community to
> be built up. Aggregating the information at the cluster,
> region, and country levels, SRP provides an important
> tool for Bahá’í institutions in their decision making pro-
> cess, enabling the prioritisation of resources and lines
> of action at each level of the administration. Although
> initially the programme will require the investment of
> some effort to train a few individuals in its use and to
> enter the base data, once in place it is proving a valuable
> aid to the process of decentralisation. Countries that are
> already implementing the SRP package include some

with a substantial size of membership, such as Brazil,
Colombia, Malaysia, and Zambia.

> Impact on administrative processes
> at the national level
2\.22       The ongoing process of decentralisation necessi- 2.22

> tated by the Five Year Plan carries with it profound
> implications for administration at the national and
> regional levels. As national communities review their
> administrative structures, it is heartening to note that
> in many instances they are doing so in anticipation of
> a community that is several fold larger in size. Such
> a perspective is necessitating a signiﬁcant shift in
> resources to the regional and cluster levels, as well as
> inevitable concomitant changes in the size and struc-
> ture of the National Ofﬁce.
2\.23       As stated above, in the vanguard of this admin- 2.23

> istrative review is India where the institutions have,
> at the encouragement of the House of Justice, begun
> to reassess and modify the national administration in
> that country to become better equipped for sustain-
> ing and extending the remarkable growth that has

2\.26       The statement in the document Building Momentum: 2.26

2\.27      In several countries, the mandates of committees 2.27

The National Spiritual Assembly of

the Bahá’ís of the United States

Dear Bahá’í Friends,
3\.1       The Universal House of Justice was impressed by 3.1

> the spirit of your letter of 7 December 2005 from which
> it sensed the earnestness of your desire and effort to
> respond effectively to its comments on developments
> in your country, as conveyed in our letter of 19 October
> 2005, that indicate a need for adjustments to be made
> to your administrative structure. It is moved to offer a
> few comments, as follows, further to assist your think-
> ing especially regarding decentralization in relation to
> the work of regional institutions.
3\.2       The administration of teaching is preeminent 3.2

> among the categories of responsibility in which a
> National Spiritual Assembly exercises its authority to
> direct and coordinate the affairs of its community. The
> execution of this responsibility is of a different char-
> acter, however, from that of, say, the administration of
> justice; for whereas the latter is properly concentrated
> in the activity of the Assembly, which must itself ren-
> der judgments on cases submitted to it, the former is
> essentially concerned with efforts initiated and main-
> tained at the base of the community and thus calls for a
> decentralized mode of management—a means of func-
> tioning that makes possible the mobilization of action
> among the generality of believers, whose individual
> initiatives must be accommodated in a coherent move-
> ment of teaching at the level of clusters. Where rapid

or substantial growth is occurring, such management
> ensures that due attention is given not only to execut-
> ing the plan for expansion and consolidation, but also
> to addressing the needs of varying patterns of growth
> from one area to another, to coping with emerging new
> realities, as well as to applying the lessons of experience
> in rapidly changing situations. This closeness of atten-
> tion is not possible from the top, whatever mechanisms
> may be set in place at the National Center. Particu-
> larly at this stage in the evolution of the Divine Plan,
> when the community must prepare administratively
> to accommodate entry by troops, your responsibility
> towards the expansion of the Faith demands a high
> degree of devolution of administrative authority to
> appropriate subsidiary institutions, so that the requi-
> sites for maintaining progressive activity in the clusters
> can be adequately met.
3\.3        For example, in this context, all programmatic and 3.3

> administrative matters pertaining to growth of the Faith
> in its area are the proper concern of every Regional
> Bahá’í Council and are to be dealt with by it in accor-
> dance with the requirements for the execution of the Five
> Year Plan in your community. The Regional Councils
> are the executive instruments of the National Spiritual
> Assembly authorized to act on its behalf in devising
> and promoting programs dedicated to fulﬁlling the aim
> of advancing the process of entry by troops. The Coun-
> cils direct and coordinate the work of cluster agencies,
> as well as ensure the collaborative involvement of Local
> Spiritual Assemblies in cluster and core activities.
3\.4       In your letter several attempts at decentraliza- 3.4

> tion are mentioned that provide examples by which to
> illustrate a sense of the meaning of the foregoing para-
> graphs. You state that you have been working with
> Regional Councils to decentralize responsibility for
> your Spiritual Assembly development program. The

development of Assemblies in relation to the teaching
> work is progressing through their direct support for
> individual initiative and cluster activities, their interac-
> tion with institutions operating at the cluster level, and
> the guidance and support they receive from Regional
> Councils. The training provided through your National
> Ofﬁce complements this process by concentrating on
> subjects that go well beyond matters of growth, touch-
> ing on such sensitive and often problematic issues as
> personal status, family violence, and other questions
> of a judicial or administrative character. Therefore you
> are free to continue these efforts, which fall mainly into
> the category of the administration of justice that you
> have carried out so well in the past, without the need
> to transfer them to the Regional Councils. Naturally, in
> scheduling events for such training, you will no doubt
> want to coordinate with the Councils to ensure that
> there is no conﬂict with the work under way in the
> clusters.
3\.5       The proposed changes in your administrative struc- 3.5

> ture that address the education of children and junior
> youth provide another useful example. Your decision
> to conclude the training function of the National Chil-
> dren’s Education and Research Center is a constructive
> step. At your request, the Regional Training Institutes
> will now provide training based on existing materials.
> The House of Justice feels that the Core Curriculum
> should be considered as a specialized branch, after
> Book 3 of the Ruhi Institute’s main sequence of courses,
> that serves the needs of teachers of Bahá’í schools for
> children. However, in relation to the neighborhood chil-
> dren’s classes, which are a natural outgrowth of Ruhi
> Institute Book 3 and the related branch being devel-
> oped, you should not insist that the teachers of such
> classes be trained in the Core Curriculum, although
> many of them may wish to beneﬁt from such training

later on. Moreover, it is understood you have materials
> that have been developed for junior youth and youth.
> Given the recent decision of the House of Justice as con-
> veyed in its letter of 28 December 2005 to all National
> Spiritual Assemblies, special programs for junior youth
> need no longer be produced at the national level, but
> such material as may be available can be offered to
> the Regional Institutes as resources they may use at
> their own discretion. As for youth, every effort should
> be made to have them complete the basic sequence of
> courses to assist them to move to the forefront of the
> work in the clusters. Regarding your interest in obtain-
> ing information from the National Spiritual Assemblies
> of Brazil and India about the operations of a National
> Training Institute Board, the House of Justice feels that
> it is not necessary for you to establish such an agency
> in your country.
3\.6       The House of Justice is especially pleased by the 3.6

> intensity of your determination to deal with the issues
> raised in the 19 October 2005 letter and looks forward to
hearing of the further progress of your consultations.

> With loving Bahá’í greetings,
> Department of the Secretariat
