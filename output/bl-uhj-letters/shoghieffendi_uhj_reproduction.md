## Genetic Engineering

### by / on behalf of [Universal House of Justice](https://bahai-library.com/author/Universal+House+of+Justice)

2000


Mr ...., Australia  
  
Dear Bahá'í Friend,  
  
The Universal House of Justice has received your email letter of 24 August 2000 and has asked us to respond as follows.  
  
The House of Justice has not found anything specific in the Bahá'í writings concerning the ethics of genetic engineering on human tissue, including foetal tissue, and on possible means of biologically creating replacement limbs and organs for human beings. It regards it as premature to give consideration to these matters and to their spiritual consequences. For the present, believers confronted with such issues are free to come to their own conclusions, based on their knowledge of the pertinent Bahá'í teachings.  
  
Enclosed for your information is [a brief compilation of passages from the Bahá'í writings on reproduction and other biological issues,](http://bahai-library.com/uhj_compilation_reproduction) which may be of interest to you in your consideration of these subjects.

With loving Bahá'í greetings,  
Department of the Secretariat
