The Religion of the Sabaeans and African-based religions in
the Americas

The Research Department has studied a number of questions
regarding the religion of the Sabaeans, and African-based religions
in the Americas such as Yoruba, Santería and Brazilian Candomble.

Religion of the Sabaeans
The Bahá’í Teachings contain few references to Sabaeanism.
Bahá’u’lláh, in His Tablets in the Persian language, describes two
different groups as Sabaeans. They are:

1\.    the followers of an ancient religion who worship idols named

> after stars and who claim to have taken their religion from Seth
> and Idrís

2\. the followers of John the Baptist who failed to recognize Jesus

> as the Manifestation of God. He further states that this group
> is known to some as the Sabaeans and that it continues to exist
> in the world.

Some scholars also refer to the followers of John the Baptist as the
Mandaeans. Currently, there are small communities of Mandaeans
living in Iraq and Iran.

As to the Sabaeans who claim to derive their religion from Seth and
Idrís, the Research Department has, to date, been able to locate only
one additional brief reference in the Bahá’í Writings to Seth. In
The Promulgation of Universal Peace: Talks Delivered by `Abdu’l-Bahá
during His Visit to the United States and Canada in 1912 (Wilmette:
Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 2007), p. 516, the Master describes Seth as
one of the “sons of Adam”.

There are, however, two very interesting references to Idrís contained
in a footnote which appears on p. 148 of Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh revealed
after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (Wilmette: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1988).
One is a quotation from the Qur’án 19:57–58, which states:

> And commemorate Idrís in the Book; for he was a man of
> truth, a Prophet; And we uplifted him to a place on high.

The second is a statement by Bahá’u’lláh in which He identifies Idrís
with Hermes:

> The first person who devoted himself to philosophy was Idrís.
> Thus was he named. Some called him also Hermes. In every
> tongue he hath a special name. He it is who hath set forth
> in every branch of philosophy thorough and convincing state-
> ments. After him Balínús derived his knowledge and sciences
> from the Hermetic Tablets and most of the philosophers
> who followed him made their philosophical and scientific
> discoveries from his words and statements.

The connection between Idrís and Sabaeanism is interesting because
it confirms not only the extreme antiquity of this group of Sabaeans,
but also the fact that knowledge of the religion has spread over the
earth—Bahá’u’lláh affirms concerning Idrís, “In every tongue he
hath a special name”. It should be noted, however, that Bahá’u’lláh
does not specifically name Idrís as the Prophet of the Sabaeans.

The Religion of the Sabaeans

In letters written on his behalf, cited below, Shoghi Effendi stresses
the general lack of conclusive historical records concerning the origins
of the Sabaean religion:

> Regarding Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl’s statement in his book The
> Bahá’í Proofs to the effect that the great religions of the world,
> excluding the Dispensations of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, are
> seven in number: what the author meant by that statement
> is that there are only seven great religions of which there
> is some existing trace or record, and not that only seven
> religions have so far appeared in the world. These seven
> religions mentioned by Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl are the following:
> Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Christi-
> anity, Islam, and the religion of the Sabaeans, which was
> originally monotheistic, and became gradually corrupted,
> and to which Abraham’s forefathers are believed to have
> belonged. (letter dated 9 July 1939 to an individual believer)

> As to the religion of the Sabaeans, very little is known about
> the origins of this religion, though we Bahá’ís are certain of
> one thing, that the founder of it has been a divinely-sent Mes-
> senger. The country where Sabaeanism became widespread and
> flourished was Chaldea, and Abraham is considered as having
> been a follower of that Faith. (letter dated 10 November 1939

to an individual believer)

> With reference to your question concerning the Sabaean and
> Hindu religions: there is nothing in the Teachings that could
> help us in ascertaining which one of these two Faiths is older.
> Neither history seems to be able to provide a definite answer
> to this question. The records concerning the origin of these
> religions are not sufficiently detailed and reliable to offer any
> conclusive evidence on this point. (letter dated 9 November
> 1940 to an individual believer)

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Thirteen

> The teachings throw no light on the Prophet of the Sabaeans.
> The followers of this religion lived in Ur of the Chaldees,
> where Abraham appeared. (letter dated 30 July 1941 to an
> individual believer)

> For more information on this subject, Mr. … is also referred to
> the writings of Mírzá Abu’l-Faḍl, specifically, The Bahá’í Proofs
> (Wilmette: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1983), and an article entitled
“Explanation of Daniel’s Interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar’s

> Dream” which is published in Star of the West, April 28, 1916, vol.

VII, no. 3, pp. 17–24.

In relation to the second group, that is the followers of John the Bap-
tist or the Mandeans, Bahá’u’lláh states that this group continues to
exist in the world. Further historical and archaeological research will,
no doubt, be required to corroborate the link between Sabaeanism
and traditional African beliefs.

African-based religions in the Americas
Mr. … enquires whether the Bahá’í Writings comment on the
immense popularity and current explosive growth of these Yoruba-
based religions in the New World and he asks about the Bahá’í view
of the “possession” that takes place during the ceremonies that invoke
the Yoruba “Orishas” (spirits, “gods”).

While we have not found any specific reference to these religious
movements in the writings of the Faith, Mr. … might well be inter-
ested in Shoghi Effendi’s discussion of the “universal fermentation”
that characterizes the “Age of Transition”, one feature of which is the
decline in recognized religions and the subsequent “emergence of an
increasing number of obscure cults, of strange and new worships, of
ineffective philosophies, whose sophisticated doctrines have intensified
the confusion of a troubled age.”1

The Religion of the Sabaeans

> As to the Bahá’í view of the “possession” that takes place during
> Yoruba ceremonies and other such “supernatural” phenomena, Mr.

… might find it useful to refer to Some Answered Questions, page 252.
`Abdu’l-Bahá indicates that, in general, the “converse, presence and

> communications of spirits is but imagination and fancy, which only
> appears to have reality”. The Universal House of Justice in a letter
> dated 30 August 1984 written on its behalf to an individual believer
> provides the following guidance concerning the attitude toward the
“psychic arts” of other people:

> The important thing for Bahá’ís to understand is that the
> influence of such “arts” is dependent on the conviction, even
> the sub-conscious conviction, of the person affected and,
> similarly, the power of the “priests” to overcome the influence
> is likewise an outcome of the sufferer’s conviction that it is
> from the “priest” that he or she will be able to obtain help.

We wish to draw Mr. …’s attention to the following extracts, drawn
from letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi and the Universal
House of Justice, which summarize the Bahá’í teachings on this topic:

> We must use the Writings of the Prophets as our measure-
> ment. If Bahá’u’lláh had attached the slightest importance
> to occult experiences, to the seeing of auras, to the hearing
> of mystic voices; if He had believed that reincarnation was a
> fact, He, Himself, would have mentioned all of these things
> in His Teachings. The fact that He passed over them in
silence shows that to Him, they had either no importance

> or no reality, and were consequently not worthy to take
> up His time as the Divine Educator of the human race.

> We must turn our faces away from these things, and toward
> the actual practice of His Teachings in our everyday life
> through our Bahá’í Administration, and in our contact

with other people and the examples we give. (From a letter
dated 22 April 1954 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to
an individual believer)

While such accounts are interesting and provoke one’s
curiosity, we have no way of checking the veracity of such
experiences. Shoghi Effendi has advised in his letters to the
friends who asked him about psychic powers that we do not
understand the nature of such phenomena, that we have no
way of being sure of what is true and what is false, that very
little is known about the mind and its workings, and that we
should endeavour to avoid giving undue consideration to such
matters. (From a letter dated 16 May 1985 written on behalf
of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer)
