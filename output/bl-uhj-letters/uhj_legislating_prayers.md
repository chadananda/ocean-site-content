To: The Universal House of Justice    
From: Research Department

In an email message dated 14 May 1995, Mr. ... states that he has recently read the transcript of a talk by Mr. Ian Semple wherein the legislative activities of the Universal House of Justice regarding worship are discussed. The transcript contains a reference to a letter "in which \[the Guardian\] indicates that the House of Justice would legislate on details related to the obligatory prayers". Mr. ... would like to have a copy of the relevant portion of this letter for study.

Mr. ...'s letter was referred to the Research Department. We have located the statement in question in a letter dated 10 October 1936 written on behalf of the Guardian to an individual believer. The statement is as follows:

> First, with regard to your questions concerning the obligatory prayers, the "Aqdas" does not give detailed instructions about them. The Universal House of Justice, however, will have to define the exact time for their recital, and lay down, if required, other detailed instructions concerning their use. One of the three obligatory prayers should be recited. This is an obligation. But individual believers are absolutely free to choose any one of them. There is no particular time of day fixed for the reading of the long prayer.
