To all National Spiritual Assemblies  
Dear Bahá'í Friends,

Applicability of the Laws and Ordinances of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas

On 9 May 1993, each National Spiritual Assembly was sent a copy of a letter written to the National Spiritual Assembly of Iceland on 9 June 1974 \[online [here](http://bahai-library.com/uhj_laws_not_binding)\], which listed those laws not at that time binding upon the Western world. The covering letter noted that the [law of Huququ'llah](http://bahai-library.com/writings/bahaullah/aqdas/synopsis.html#IV.D.1.b) had been made universally binding at Ridvan 1992. On 28 December 1999, the Universal House of Justice wrote to the Bahá'ís throughout the world \[online [here](http://bahai-library.com/uhj_further_application_aqdas)\] informing them of the universal application of the remaining aspects of the laws of [prayer](http://bahai-library.com/writings/bahaullah/aqdas/synopsis.html#IV.A) and [fasting](http://bahai-library.com/writings/bahaullah/aqdas/synopsis.html#IV.B).

Therefore, to bring the information up to date, we have been asked to send you the enclosed list of laws not yet universally applied, to replace the one sent to you in May 1993.

With loving Bahá'í greetings,  
For Department of the Secretariat

### Laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas not yet Universally Applied

28 December 1999  

Following the universal application of the laws on prayer, fasting and the recitation of the Greatest Name, the Universal House of Justice has provided the following list of laws noted in the Synopsis and Codification of the Kitáb-I-Aqdas which are not at present universally binding upon the friends. The numbers of the sections are given for ease of reference.

For the burial of the dead the only requirements now binding in the West are to bury the body (not to cremate it), not to carry it more than a distance of one hour's journey from the place of death, and to say the Prayer for the Dead if the deceased is a believer over the age of 15.

The laws relating to the finding of lost property, the disposition of treasure trove, the disposal of objects held in trust and compensation for manslaughter are all designed for a future state of society. These matters are usually covered by the civil law of each country.

Arson, adultery, murder and theft are all forbidden to Bahá'ís, but the punishments prescribed for them in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas are designed for a future state of society. Such matters are usually covered by the civil laws of each country.

The laws prohibiting the use of the type of pools which used to be found in persian baths, the plunging of one's hand in food, the shaving of one's head and the growth of men's hair below the lobe of the ear.

All the exhortations listed in section [IV.D.3](http://bahai-library.com/writings/bahaullah/aqdas/synopsis.html#IV.D.3) are applicable universally at the present time insofar as it is possible for the friends to implement them: for example, the exhortation to teach one's children to chant the Holy Verses in the Mashriqu'l-Adhkar can be literally carried out only on a limited scale at the present time, but the friends should, nevertheless, teach their children the Holy Writings as far as possible.
