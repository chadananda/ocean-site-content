The Friends in Iran

Dear Bahá’í Friends,

We have received a letter from a believer in Iran with
questions about the Guardianship and the Universal House of
Justice. We appreciate that firmness in the Covenant is among
the distinctive characteristics of the believers in that land, who
are informed of the principles and essential facts pertaining to
the succession of authority in the Cause. Nevertheless, none
among them should hesitate to seek clarification of matters
about which they have questions, for the enemies of the Faith
are tireless in their attempts to sow seeds of confusion and
doubt. Moreover, it is beneficial, in view of the beloved
Master’s exhortations to us all to be ever-vigilant concerning
matters of protection, for the friends to review the relevant
essentials from time to time. We have therefore decided to
provide you with the following comments. In this connection,
you are also encouraged to reacquaint yourselves with the
document “Mason Remey and Those Who Followed Him”, a
statement prepared at our instruction by an ad hoc committee.
A translation of the statement is enclosed.

Questions concerning the Guardianship and the Universal
House of Justice can be resolved through careful study of the

288                                     Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

writings of Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi and
the elucidations of the House of Justice, which, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
states, will “deliberate upon all problems which have caused
difference, questions that are obscure and matters that are not
expressly recorded in the Book. Whatsoever they decide,” He
assures the friends, “has the same effect as the Text itself.”

Prior to the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in 1921, the provisions
He had put in place in His Will and Testament to safeguard the
Faith and ensure its steady advancement into the future were
generally unknown. The believers anticipated a day when the
Universal House of Justice would be established since it had
been specifically mentioned in the Sacred Texts. There was,
however, no definite understanding that there would be a
Guardian. Indeed, Shoghi Effendi later indicated that he had
no foreknowledge of the position to which he would be called.
At most, he had reportedly thought the Will and Testament
might charge him, as the eldest grandson of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, with
responsibility for arranging for the election of the House of
Justice. Only after the reading of the Will did the institution
of the Guardianship become widely known, and the Bahá’í
community worldwide acknowledged Shoghi Effendi as the
Head of the Faith to whom all must turn.

An attentive reading of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will makes it clear
that He did not indicate a predestined outcome but did
provide for a number of circumstances which, depending
on future conditions, might eventually confront the Faith. The
second section of the Will, for instance, which refers only to
the Universal House of Justice, with no mention of the
Guardianship, was written at a time when His own life was in
imminent danger and Shoghi Effendi was but a small boy.
During that same period, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had made arrangements
for the election of the Universal House of Justice to take place
immediately, should the threat on His life materialize. Through
the grace of God, the crisis passed, and it was ultimately left to
Shoghi Effendi many years later, as Guardian and Head of the
Faith, to determine the timing of the formation of the House
of Justice. Early on he considered the possibility of holding
the election soon after the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in which
case the House of Justice and the Guardian would have
functioned simultaneously. He determined, of course, that the

Elucidations                                                   289

foundations of the Administrative Order needed first to be
firmly laid at the local and national levels, and it eventually
transpired that the House of Justice was established several
years after his own passing. That the transition from the
ministry of the Guardian to the election of the Universal House
of Justice occurred with such relative ease can, itself, be
attributed to the way certain provisions in the Will were
formulated.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament clearly allows for the
possibility of a successor to Shoghi Effendi, and in this light,
we find statements written by him or on his behalf over
the course of his thirty-six-year ministry that envision future
Guardians. However, there are no assurances in the Writings
that the line of Guardians would continue throughout the
Dispensation; rather, the possibility is envisaged that such a
line would come to an end. In this respect, Bahá’u’lláh states in
the Kitáb-i-Aqdas:

> Endowments dedicated to charity revert to God, the
> Revealer of Signs. None hath the right to dispose of
> them without leave from Him Who is the Dawning-
> place of Revelation. After Him, this authority shall
> pass to the Aghßán, and after them to the House of
> Justice — should it be established in the world by then
> — that they may use these endowments for the benefit
> of the Places which have been exalted in this Cause, and
> for whatsoever hath been enjoined upon them by Him
> Who is the God of might and power. Otherwise, the
> endowments shall revert to the people of Bahá who
> speak not except by His leave and judge not save in
> accordance with what God hath decreed in this Tablet
> — lo, they are the champions of victory betwixt heaven
> and earth — that they may use them in the manner that
> hath been laid down in the Book by God, the Mighty,
> the Bountiful.
The passing of Shoghi Effendi precipitated the situation
described, in which the authority vested in the Aghßán — first
in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and then in Shoghi Effendi — ended before the
House of Justice was established.

290                                        Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

In His Will and Testament, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá specifies in the
clearest terms the conditions according to which Shoghi
Effendi was to have named his successor as Guardian:

> O ye beloved of the Lord! It is incumbent upon the
> guardian of the Cause of God to appoint in his own
> life-time him that shall become his successor, that
> differences may not arise after his passing. He that is
> appointed must manifest in himself detachment from
> all worldly things, must be the essence of purity, must
> show in himself the fear of God, knowledge, wisdom
> and learning. Thus, should the first-born of the
> guardian of the Cause of God not manifest in himself
> the truth of the words: — ”The child is the secret essence
> of its sire,” that is, should he not inherit of the
> spiritual within him (the guardian of the Cause of God)
> and his glorious lineage not be matched with a goodly
> character, then must he, (the guardian of the Cause of
> God) choose another branch to succeed him.
> The Hands of the Cause of God must elect from their
> own number nine persons that shall at all times be
> occupied in the important services in the work of the
> guardian of the Cause of God. The election of these
> nine must be carried either unanimously or by majority
> from the company of the Hands of the Cause of God
> and these, whether unanimously or by a majority vote,
> must give their assent to the choice of the one whom
> the guardian of the Cause of God hath chosen as his
> successor. This assent must be given in such wise as the
> assenting and dissenting voices may not be
> distinguished (i.e., secret ballot).
The personal views of any individual regarding the above
statement, no matter how learned, cannot compare with the
Guardian’s infallible understanding of the passage. Shoghi
Effendi, who faithfully adhered to the wishes of Bahá’u’lláh and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá throughout his ministry, would never have been
careless in a matter so essential to the integrity of the Faith
as the question of the appointment of his successor. It is
unthinkable that he would appoint someone to succeed him
who did not possess the qualifications laid down by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá in His Will. It is equally untenable to suggest that he

Elucidations                                                 291

would do so in a manner which deviated from the explicit
requirements in that same document, which included the
affirmation of his choice by nine designated Hands of the
Cause of God, so that “differences” would “not arise after his
passing.” How perverse the suggestion of the violators of the
Covenant that Shoghi Effendi would ignore the Master’s
instructions and make a veiled and indirect appointment of his
successor! Rather should the fact that Shoghi Effendi did not
name a successor be seen as a sign of his meticulous adherence
to every word of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and an indication of his
conclusion that there was no qualified individual whom he
could appoint.

Therefore, it should be clear to every steadfast follower of
Bahá’u’lláh that the end of the line of Guardians was not the
result of any decision or action taken by the Hands of the
Cause of God following the sudden passing of Shoghi Effendi.
The line was brought to a close when, compelled by existing
circumstances and the strict provisions of the Will, Shoghi
Effendi did not name a successor. To entertain the possibility
that it may one day be re-established is futile. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
wrote that “ere the expiration of a thousand years, no one has
the right to utter a single word, even to claim the station of
Guardianship.” And in the same passage He exhorted the
friends, “Should there be differences of opinion, the Supreme
House of Justice would immediately resolve the problems.” The
Universal House of Justice, soon after its formation, stated
that it “finds that there is no way to appoint or to legislate to
make it possible to appoint a second Guardian to succeed
Shoghi Effendi.”

While the line of Guardians has ended, the Covenant is
preserved. The vast body of interpretations of Shoghi Effendi
informs the decisions of the Universal House of Justice as the
Faith continues its onward march. The unity of the Faith is
safeguarded, and the realization of Bahá’u’lláh’s great purpose
for humanity assured. “The Hand of Omnipotence hath
established His Revelation upon an unassailable, an enduring
foundation,” Bahá’u’lláh has stated. “Storms of human strife
are powerless to undermine its basis, nor will men’s fanciful
theories succeed in damaging its structure.”

***

With reference to the specific questions raised in the letter
we have received, one concerns the meaning of the designation
“Aghßán”, as found in the Writings. While in some cases, as
affirmed by the Guardian, the term applies specifically to
Bahá’u’lláh’s sons, at other times it is used more broadly to
include His male descendants. For example, in His Will and
Testament ‘Abdu’l-Bahá refers to Shoghi Effendi as “the chosen
branch” (Ghußn-i-Mumtáz). The reference to Shoghi Effendi as
Ghußn here — the singular form of Aghßán — follows the usage
of Bahá’u’lláh in relation to the titles He gave His sons, that is,
the Most Great Branch, the Greater Branch, and the Purest
Branch. A letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi explains
that the word Aghßán “refers to Bahá’u’lláh’s descendants”;
another describes Hussein Rabbani, the Guardian’s brother, as
“the grandchild of the Master, an Afnán and Aghßán mentioned
in the Will and Testament of the Master.” It is evident, then,
that the designation Aghßán, or Ghußn, includes Shoghi Effendi
and the other male descendants of Bahá’u’lláh.

If, at any time, male descendants of Bahá’u’lláh appear who
are faithful to the Covenant, it would nevertheless not be
possible for any of them to occupy the office of Guardian, for,
as already explained, in the absence of appointment by Shoghi
Effendi, they cannot claim the station of Guardianship and
there is no way for one to be named to it by an act of the
House of Justice.

***

Another query concerns the establishment of the Universal
House of Justice. Specifically, the question has been asked
whether the functioning of an “officially recognized”
International Bahá’í Court in the Holy Land, mentioned by
Shoghi Effendi, was an essential preliminary step in the
evolution of the Universal House of Justice.

As you are no doubt aware, Shoghi Effendi explained that
“‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Himself, in one of His earliest Tablets,
contemplated the possibility of the formation of the Universal
House of Justice in His own lifetime.” The Master described

Elucidations                                                    293

the requirements necessary for its formation, which did not
include the establishment of a religious court:

> The Supreme House of Justice should be elected
> according to the system followed in the election of the
> parliaments of Europe. And when the countries would
> be guided the Houses of Justice of the various
> countries would elect the Supreme House of Justice.
> At whatever time all the beloved of God in each country
> appoint their delegates, and these in turn elect their
> representatives, and these representatives elect a body,
> that body shall be regarded as the Supreme House of
> Justice.
> The establishment of that House is not dependent upon
> the conversion of all the nations of the world. For
> example, if conditions were favourable and no
> disturbances would be caused, the friends in Persia
> would elect their representatives, and likewise
> the friends in America, in India, and other areas would
> also elect their representatives, and these would elect a
> House of Justice. That House of Justice would be the
> Supreme House of Justice. That is all.
Over the thirty-six years of his ministry, as he guided the
Bahá’í world, striving to lay the foundations of the
Administrative Order, Shoghi Effendi outlined specific
developmental steps to be taken, which were intended to lead to
the eventual establishment of the Universal House of Justice.
The accomplishment of some depended largely on the exertions
of the believers themselves — an increase in the number of Local
and National Spiritual Assemblies, the appointment of the
International Bahá’í Council and its evolution into an elected
body. Others, however, were subject to the forces operating in
society and, no matter what the efforts made by the Bahá’í
community, could not be accomplished.

In 1929, for instance, the Guardian stated, “given favorable
circumstances, under which the Bahá’ís of Persia and of the
adjoining countries under Soviet rule may be enabled to elect
their national representatives … the only remaining obstacle in
the way of the definite formation of the International House

294                                       Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eleven

of Justice will have been removed.” Later, following the
expulsion of Bahá’ís from Russia by the authorities, a letter
written on his behalf explained, “At the time he referred to
Russia there were Bahá’ís there, now the Community has
practically ceased to exist; therefore the formation of the
International House of Justice cannot depend on a Russian
National Spiritual Assembly.”

In the same way, goals were specified by Shoghi Effendi for
the establishment of Bahá’í courts, including national courts in
certain countries in Asia and, as a step in the development
of the International Bahá’í Council, the precursor to the
Universal House of Justice, a court in the Holy Land.
Recognition by the Egyptian government of the National
Spiritual Assembly as an independent Bahá’í court was sought
as far back as 1929. Over time, changing conditions rendered
the formation of such religious courts impossible. As the
Hands of the Cause of God commented in 1959 in calling for
the election of the International Bahá’í Council and the
eventual establishment of the House of Justice,

> We wish to assure the believers that every effort will be
> made to establish a Bahá’í Court in the Holy Land prior
> to the date set for this election. We should however
> bear in mind that the Guardian himself clearly
> indicated this goal, due to the strong trend towards the
> secularization of Religious Courts in this part of
the world, might not be achieved.

***

Yet another question that has been raised concerns the
discharge by the Universal House of Justice of certain
functions previously performed by the Guardian. With regard
to Óuqúqu’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has explained that “Disposition
of the Óuqúq, wholly or partly, is permissible, but this should
be done by permission of the authority in the Cause to whom
all must turn.” Likewise, the expulsion of Covenant-breakers is
an obligation exercised by the Head of the Faith in the context
of the duty to protect the Cause from those who would seek
to undermine its unity. Shoghi Effendi, it is well known, was
obliged to expel Covenant-breakers from the Faith at different
points throughout his ministry, both before and after the

appointment of the Hands of the Cause of God. This
responsibility now falls on the Universal House of Justice, as
the centre of authority to whom all must turn. The current
procedures followed in this respect are outlined in the
statement “The Institution of the Counsellors”.

In this connection it should be noted that after the passing
of Shoghi Effendi, although overwhelmed with grief, the Bahá’í
world maintained its unity during the tenuous period between
his ministry and the election of the Universal House of Justice.
The sole challenge to its integrity appeared some two years after
his death when Charles Mason Remey, who was at that time one
of the Hands of the Cause, laid claim to the Guardianship. As
you are aware, Remey asserted that his appointment in 1951 as
president of the nascent International Bahá’í Council meant
that he should automatically assume the position of head of the
Universal House of Justice and was, therefore, the second
Guardian.

The absurdity of Remey’s claim is obvious and requires little
elaboration. In 1957, he was among the Hands of the Cause
who gathered in the Holy Land to consider what course of
action should be taken following the unexpected passing of the
Guardian. He personally affirmed that Shoghi Effendi had
appointed no successor, signing a document issued
unanimously by the Hands to this effect. As signatory to yet
another such document, he agreed that the entire body of the
Hands of the Cause would determine when and how the
evolution of the International Bahá’í Council would culminate
in the election of the House of Justice. For two years, as one of
the nine Hands designated to serve in the Holy Land, he
participated in the consultations that guided the development
of the Bahá’í community. Then, without notice or discussion
with his fellow Hands, he claimed the station of Guardianship,
lacking explicit appointment by Shoghi Effendi as specified in
the Will and Testament and in direct violation of the command
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá that no one could make such a claim.
Exercising the authority conferred on them in accordance with
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will, the Hands of the Cause expelled him from
the Faith as a Covenant-breaker.

***

In matters related to the Covenant, the friends must be firm
and steadfast; they should be wary, lest the arguments put
forward by those who sow seeds of doubt become the cause for
confusion or lead to disputation and disunity. Should
questions arise that cannot be resolved, they should be placed
immediately before the Universal House of Justice. The friends
must be especially careful to avoid being enticed by the
whisperings of the remnants of the Covenant-breakers and their
supporters, who seek to shake the believers’ faith. Whereas in
the past the violators of the Covenant sought to undermine the
authority of Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi,
today they challenge the Universal House of Justice. Of
particular concern are those who, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá warns,
“assert their firmness and steadfastness in the Covenant but
when they come across responsive ears they secretly sow the
seeds of suspicion.”

Remey’s small band of associates, bedevilled by half a
century of infighting among competing factions, have had
negligible effect on the progress of the Faith. The flurry caused
by their actions does nothing more than shake a few lifeless
twigs and leaves from the tree of the Cause. Those who are
naïve, those who are not deepened in the Teachings or not firm
in the Covenant, those who are controlled by their egos and lust
for leadership can be misled and fall away. The friends are
urged to protect themselves and their community by adhering
strictly to the emphatic exhortations repeated throughout the
Sacred Texts. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states,

> Unto the Most Holy Book every one must turn and all
> that is not expressly recorded therein must be referred
> to the Universal House of Justice. That which this
> body, whether unanimously or by a majority doth
> carry, that is verily the Truth and the Purpose of God
> Himself. Whoso doth deviate therefrom is verily of
> them that love discord, hath shown forth malice and
> turned away from the Lord of the Covenant. By this
> House is meant that Universal House of Justice which
> is to be elected from all countries, that is from those
> parts in the East and West where the loved ones are to
> be found, after the manner of the customary elections
> in Western countries such as those of England….

> And now, one of the greatest and most fundamental
> principles of the Cause of God is to shun and avoid
> entirely the Covenant-breakers, for they will utterly
> destroy the Cause of God, exterminate His Law and
> render of no account all efforts exerted in the past. O
> friends! It behooveth you to call to mind with
> tenderness the trials of His Holiness, the Exalted One,
> and show your fidelity to the Ever-Blest Beauty. The
> utmost endeavour must be exerted lest all these woes,
> trials and afflictions, all this pure and sacred blood
> that hath been shed so profusely in the Path of God,
> may prove to be in vain….
> O ye beloved of the Lord! Strive with all your heart to
> shield the Cause of God from the onslaught of the
> insincere, for souls such as these cause the straight to
> become crooked and all benevolent efforts to produce
> contrary results.
The believers in the Cradle of the Faith, who have withstood
for more than a century the onslaught of government and
clergy, who triumphed over the perils posed by the rebellions of
Azal and Mu˙ammad ‘Alí, who severed themselves from those
who opposed Shoghi Effendi, will easily discount the spurious
and ridiculous arguments of those few individuals who vie
among themselves to exploit Remey’s deviation as a pretext for
attracting a handful of personal followers. Be assured of our
supplications at the Holy Threshold on behalf of the beloved
friends everywhere in that sacred land.
