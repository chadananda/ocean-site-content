Infallibility of the Universal House of Justice

(Translation from Persian)

Extract from a letter dated 20 May 2007 to the Friends in Iran
from the Department of the Secretariat

Your letter dated 15 January 2007, containing two
questions, one regarding the correspondence received from the
Bahá’í World Centre and the other concerning the infallibility
of the Universal House of Justice, has been received and
submitted to the House of Justice. We have been asked to
convey the following.

As to whether there is a distinction between correspondence
from the World Centre that has been signed “The Universal
House of Justice” and that signed on behalf of the Department
of the Secretariat, in brief, the manner in which each of these
letters is prepared depends upon the contents of the letter. On
some occasions the Universal House of Justice communicates
directly over its own signature. It generally communicates with
the institutions of the Faith and the believers through its
Secretariat on the basis of decisions and policies determined in
its consultations. Hence, communications conveyed over the
signature of the Department of the Secretariat are authorized
by the House of Justice.

You have stated that believers have asked, “Are the decisions
of the Universal House of Justice free from error even if
incorrect information has been provided to it?” The
infallibility of the House of Justice, like that of the Guardian,
is “conferred”, as distinct from the infallibility of the
Manifestation of God, which is “innate”. The House of
Justice, like the Guardian, is not omniscient; when called upon
to make a decision, it wants to receive information and facts
and at times consults experts on the subject. Like him, it may
well change its decision when new facts emerge or in light of
changed conditions.

In the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá on this
matter, there is no reference to the nature and extent of the
information to which the House of Justice should have access
when making its decisions. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá states,

> Let it not be imagined that the House of Justice will
> take any decision according to its own concepts and
> opinions. God forbid! The Supreme House of Justice
> will take decisions and establish laws through the
> inspiration and confirmation of the Holy Spirit.
Again, He says:

> Whatever will be its decision, by majority vote, shall be
> the real truth, inasmuch as that House is under the
> protection, unerring guidance, and care of the one true
> Lord. He shall guard it from error and will protect it
> under the wing of His sanctity and infallibility.
Bahá’ís, of course, may seek the views of the House of
Justice about its decisions if they feel they have new
information or that conditions have changed but in doing so
should avoid the temptation to use this as an excuse to evade
their obligation to obey and thus deprive themselves of the
bounty of full obedience.
