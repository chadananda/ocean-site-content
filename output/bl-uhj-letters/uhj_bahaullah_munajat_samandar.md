>      Your email of 16 August 2001, enquiring on behalf of a few believers in your community about the authenticity of a prayer which begins with the words “O my God! Thou seest me detached...”, was received at the Bahá’í World Centre.
> 
>      The Research Department of the Universal House of Justice has advised that the prayer in question was revealed by Bahá’u’lláh to Jináb-i-Samandar \[Shaykh Kázim Samandar\], the father of the Hand of the Cause of God, Tarázu’lláh Samandarí, to assist him in making a difficult decision. The prayer was to be recited 19 times, followed by meditation on the problem, the formulation of a solution, and the implementation of the conceived solution.

>      There is no authorized translation for this prayer. However, as it was noted that the electronic copy of the prayer which you appended to your message differs from the version held at the World Centre, we provide the following provisional translation for your information.
> 
>      You may be interested to know that the Research Department has ascertained that the prayer was revealed in Arabic and is published in _Majmú’iy-i-Alváh-i-Mubarakiy-i-Hadrat-i-Bahá’u’lláh_ (Tihrán: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 132 B.E.), page 9, transcribed by ’Andalib.\[1\]

Short Prayer for Decision, Revealed for Shaykh Kázim Samandar\[3\]

**Notes**

\[1\] No date or period of revelation for this text is known to the present editor (MW’s note).

\[2\] The Arabic title given to this text is merely provided for identification purposes and does not occur in the original. The editor thanks Dr. Mehrán Ghasempour for suggesting this title (MW’s note).

\[3\] Shaykh Kázim-i-Qazviní (1844 - 189?), surnamed Samandar, by Bahá’u’lláh and named as one of the Apostles of the Blessed Beauty. He was an outstanding teacher and champion of the Faith, and, from his earliest days, associated with many of the heroes and heroines of the Bábí Dispensation. In 1867, during the Most Great Separation, he wrote a treatise denouncing and refuting the claims of Mírzá Yahyá, and became a pillar of strength for the Bahá’ís of ’Irán, particularly in Qazvín. Later, near the end of his life, he defended the Covenant from the misrepresentations and lies of Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí. Many Tablets by Bahá’u’lláh were addressed to him, including the _Lawh-i-Fu’ád_ (See  _Summons of the Lord of Hosts: Tablets of Bahá‘u‘lláh_, pp. 177-181). He was also an historian; his work, the _Tarikh-i-Samandar_ (_The History of Samandar_), which was printed in Tíhrán in 1974, is cited many times by ‘Adib Taherzadeh. See _The Revelation of Bahá‘u‘lláh_, Vol. II, pp. 88-91 (MW’s note).
