Dear Bahá’í Friend,

Your email letters of 25 April and 22 May 2007, inquiring about the
recipient of a Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, have been received at the Bahá’í World
Centre and forwarded to the Research Department for study.

The Research Department confirms that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s original Tablet,
part of which was published in Amr va Khalq, volume 2 (Hofheim: Bahá’í-
Verlag, 1985), pages 45 and 46, was addressed to Amír Khán of Tihrán. A
copy of that Tablet was sent to you as an attachment to a memorandum dated
16 May 1996 written by the Research Department at the instruction of the
Universal House of Justice. An additional copy of that material is enclosed for
your study.

As the name of the recipient of the Tablet is not cited in the above-
mentioned memorandum, you may wish to change the wording of the source
of your published footnote to read, “An attachment of the Research
Department memorandum dated 16 May 1996”.

With loving Bahá’í greetings,
Department of the Secretariat
Enclosure with attachment

MEMORANDUM

To:               The Universal House of Justice
Date:             6 August 2007
F rom:            Research Department

T ablet to A mír K hán and Related Q uestions

The Research Department received a copy of Mr. Phillip Tussing’s
email letter dated 25 May 2007 and studied the matters that he has raised in
his message. The following is our response to his questions:
1\.       The text of the Tablet is correct. In response to his request, the

> facsimile of the original Persian text is attached. The Research
> Department is not aware of whether a copy of the Tablet also exists in
> the handwriting of Mírzá ‘Alí Akbar Mílání.
2\.       As indicated in the attached facsimile, the Tablet was revealed in

> honor of a certain Amír Khán, about whom we have no information.
> Therefore, we can not verify the biographical information provided by
> Dr. Iraj Ayman and quoted in Mr. Tussing’s email. The Archives
> Office at the Bahá’í World Centre so far has no evidence regarding
> the questions that Amír Khán submitted to the Master.
3\.a.     The Research Department is not aware of any other Tablets, textually

> similar to that of Amír Khán, in which the question of the “Call of
> God” being raised in North America is discussed.
b.       The terms “Call of God” and “America”, of course, appear in a

> number of Tablets of the Master in various other contexts unrelated to
> the text of the Tablet to Amír Khán. As Mr. Tussing has indicated in
> his letter, the term “Call of God” in the Bahá’í texts relates to God’s
> voice and His summons, messages and teachings.
c.       The literal meaning of the Persian term “farámúsh shudih ast” is

> “forgotten”, as it appears in the English translation of the Tablet. The
> Research Department is not in a position to interpret the term beyond
> its literal meaning.
4\.       The Master’s likening of the indigenous Americans to the pre-Islamic

> Arabs, which is described in His Tablets of the Divine Plan, is not
> noticed in His other works.

 249     Donald Addison & Christopher Buck                Messengers North America

To:               The Universal House of Justice
Date:             16 May 1996
F rom:            Research Department

T ablet of the Holy Mariner;
the “Call of God” and Native Messengers
In his electronic mail messages dated 15 November 1995 and 22

November 1995 to the Universal House of Justice, Mr. Christopher Buck
requests certain materials concerning the Tablet of the Holy Mariner and
raises questions about an extract from a Tablet revealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to
which reference is made in memoranda prepared by the Research Department
on 25 August 1994, 24 May 1988 and 22 October 1995. We respond as
follows.

1\.       T ablet of the Holy Mariner

As Mr. Buck requested, we attach a photocopy of the original of the
section of this Tablet that was revealed in the Persian language together with
a short list of references from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, from God Passes
By, and from letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi concerning the Tablet
of the Holy Mariner. To date, no English translation of the Persian section of
this Tablet is available at the Bahá’í World Centre. However, a brief summary
of the contents of this Tablet may be found in Adib Taherzadeh’s The
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, rev. ed. (Oxford: George Ronald, 1988), volume 1,
page 243.

2\.     Tablet Revealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in A mr va K halq, volume 2,
pages 45-46

We attach for Mr. Buck a copy of the original of the Tablet revealed
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, part of which is published in Amr va Khalq, volume 2,
pages 45–46. As noted in our memorandum of 25 August 1994, the beginning
and final passages of this Tablet are published in Amr va Khalq, volume 3,
pages 307–308.

The English translation of the section of the Tablet that appears in
volume 2, pages 45-46 is as follows:

In ancient times the people of America were, through their
> northern regions, close to Asia, that is, separated from Asia by a strait.
> For this reason, it hath been said that crossing had occurred. There are
> other signs which indicate communication.

As to places whose people were not informed of the appearance
> of Prophets, such people are excused. In the Qur’án it hath been
> revealed: “We will not chastise them if they had not been sent a
Messenger.”

Undoubtedly in those regions the Call of God must have been
raised in ancient times, but it hath been forgotten now.
As Mr. Buck observed, the final paragraph of the Tablet is cited in the
Research Department memorandum of 24 May 1988. The first and last
paragraphs are quoted in the letter dated 7 July 1988, written on behalf of the
Universal House of Justice to an individual believer, which was attached to
our memorandum of 22 October 1995, and phrases from the final paragraph
are also cited in the October 1995 memorandum.

3\.      The “Call of God” and Native Messengers

Mr. Buck states that he regards the phrase “Call of God”, mentioned
in the extract above, as a technical term which “is very clearly a reference to
the teachings that originate from Manifestations of God”. He also indicates
that this Tablet appears to provide “a textual basis for establishing in principle
but not in name — the existence of Manifestations of God sent to the
aboriginals of North America, and possibly, by extension, to other indigenous
peoples as well”. He, therefore, proposes that

> … the Faith officially proclaim that God, in addition to sending the
> named Manifestations of God that we already have accepted, has sent
> “Messengers of God to Indigenous Peoples” as a principle grounded in
> Amr va Khalq (vol. 2, pp. 45-46). We should at least be able to assert
> that there were “Messengers of God to First Nations”, as we say in
Canada.

Further, Mr. Buck’s understanding of the Tablet leads him to question
whether the Research Department used excerpts from the Tablet to support
two conflicting views. Before considering this question, it is, as Mr. Buck
says, important to address the issue of the meaning of the term “Call of God”.

3\.1     The “Call of God”

The Persian term translated as “Call of God” in the above Tablet is
“nidáy-i-Iláhí ”. This term appears frequently in the Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
with differing shades of meaning. By way of illustration, we provide the
following examples from Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
(Haifa: Bahá’í World Centre, 1982), each of which contains the expression
“nidáy-i-Iláhí ”, though the English translations differ:

> OJBS:Online Journal of Bahá’í Studies      250                             1 (2007)
© 2007 Donald Addison & Christopher Buck

- Section 15, page 31: “… for this did Bahá’u’lláh raise up the
call of the Lord”.

- Section 195, pages 234–235: Referring to the influence of
> opposition to the Faith on its dissemination, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá asks: “How
> else could His summons have been heard in the continents of America
and of Africa the dark?”

- Section 219, page 274: “Although ye dwell in western lands,
> still, praise be to God, ye did hear His call from out the east and, even
as Moses, did warm your hands at the fire kindled in the Asian Tree.”

- Section 225, page 283: Describing the “Two calls to success
> and prosperity”, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá indicates that the second “is the soul-
> stirring call of God”, which, He explains, “is founded upon the
> instructions and exhortations of the Lord and the admonitions and
> altruistic emotions belonging to the realm of morality which, like unto
> a brilliant light, brighten and illumine the lamp of the realities of
> mankind. Its penetrative power is the Word of God.”
From these several examples, it is suggested that while the “Call of
God” is clearly “founded” upon the teachings of the Manifestation of God,
being in the physical presence of the Manifestation is but one means by which
people become informed of “His summons”.

3\.2      Native Messengers

With regard to whether the excerpt from the Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
cited above enunciates a general principle that permits the conclusion that
God sent His Messengers to indigenous peoples, specifically to the Americas,
we wish to note, that, to date, the Research Department has not been able to
locate any authoritative interpretation of the Master’s Tablet in the Bahá’í
Teachings, nor have we found a text which clearly indicates that
Manifestations of God have appeared in the Americas. We offer the following
points for consideration:

T he T ablet

It is not clear from the context of the Tablet that the reference to
raising the “Call of God” presupposes the presence of a Manifestation of God
in the Americas.

The Master’s Tablet appears to be a response to a question about the
fate of people who live in “places” which have not been penetrated by the call
of the Prophets. If this be so, then ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s statement about the raising
of the “Call of God” could simply imply that “the people of America” were
“informed about the appearance of Prophets” as a result of the contact and
“other signs which indicate communication” that occurred “in ancient times”

between the peoples of America and Asia. In this regard, the following extract
from a letter dated 25 November 1950, written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to
an individual believer is of interest:

> It is possible the Indians of the Americas were influenced in the
> remote past by Prophets in Asia. But again, as there is nothing in our
> teachings about it we cannot do more than speculate.

Statement in T he Promulgation of Universal Peace, page 289

In one of His talks published in The Promulgation of Universal Peace,
‘Abdu’l-Bahá is reported to have stated:

> The East has ever been the dawning point of the Sun of Reality. All
> the Prophets of God have appeared there. The religions of God have
> been promulgated, the teachings of God have been spread and the
> Law of God founded in the East. The Orient has always been the
> centre of lights.
The principle enunciated in this statement is confirmed in the
published letters of Shoghi Effendi. For example, in his letter addressed to the
Asian Intercontinental Teaching Conference in October 1953, the Guardian
refers to the “Asiatic continent” as “the cradle of the principal religions of
mankind”. And, in his letter entitled “America and the Most Great Peace”,
Shoghi Effendi reiterated the principle and actually cites this and other similar
passages from Promulgation on the same subject.

Prophetic Figures

While we are unable to locate a text which clearly indicates that
Manifestations of God have appeared in the Americas, the Bahá’í Teachings
and the Qur’án recognize the possibility of individuals’ being centres of
divine guidance for their own people, without occupying the station of Major
Prophethood. In a letter dated 21 December 1986, written on behalf of the
Universal House of Justice to a National Spiritual Assembly, the House of
Justice states:

> … there are also other prophetic figures who are under the shadow of
> the Manifestation, and personages, such as sages, seers, and divine
> men of learning, who because of their wisdom and guidance,
> profoundly influence the lives of people in certain parts of the world.

4\.       T wo Conflicting Views?

Mr. Buck refers to Research Department memoranda dated 24 May
1988 and 22 October 1995, which, he believes, use the statement from the

> OJBS:Online Journal of Bahá’í Studies      252                            1 (2007)

Tablet of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá about the “Call of God” to support two opposing
points of view. He states that, while, in one memorandum the passage argues
the possibility of two Manifestations of God on earth at the same time, in the
second, it is used to argue against the possibility of Native Manifestations in
the Americas.

In our memorandum of 24 May 1988, the Department was addressing,
among other things, the question of whether, in the past, it was possible that
two Manifestations of God could have lived at the same time. In commenting
on this question, we called attention to the fact that the Bahá’í Teachings
contain no exact information about the dates of Dispensations prior to
Muhammad, that our Writings and the Qur’án indicate that Manifestations
and other prophetic figures have been sent down to mankind from the
beginning of time, and that the records concerning many of these personages
have been lost. Since we were not able to find any clear guidance in the
Bahá’í Teachings concerning the possibility of two Manifestations of God
having lived at the same time, our tentative conclusion — that it was not
possible to rule out such a possibility — was based on the fact that the
Teachings affirm that the traces of many such personages had been lost. The
statement from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was cited in this connection, rather than to
argue for the presence of Messengers in a particular place, i.e., the Americas.
This usage is consistent with our reading, as outlined above, of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s statement as an affirmation of the fact that “In ancient times the
people of America” had been “informed of the appearance of Prophets”, but
that “it hath been forgotten now”.

With regard to the citation of the Master’s statement about the “Call
of God” in our memorandum of 22 October 1995, we wish to note that
reference to this passage was included because it is one of a small number of
texts and authoritative statements which, when considered in relation to each
other, help to provide insight into the question of whether or not Messengers
of God have arisen in the western hemisphere. Based on these materials, it is
our view that evidence for the advent of Messengers of God in the Americas
does not appear to be very strong. However, we have found no text which
explicitly rules out the possibility.
