                Authority and Centrality of
the Universal House of Justice1

The Friends in Iran

Dear Bahá’í Friends,

Further to the letter to you of 18 February 2008 concerning the
Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice, we have been
requested to provide the comments below on a related matter. It
seems that questions have arisen regarding the infallibility of the
House of Justice, in light of the presentation of the topic by Dr. Udo
Schaefer, a well-known Bahá’í in Germany, whose publications have
been translated and circulated in Iran.

In his book “Making the Crooked Straight” and in other publications,
Dr. Schaefer offers his personal views on infallibility as it pertains to
the Universal House of Justice. In an effort to defend the Faith and
explain the concept in a manner acceptable to a sceptical world, he
suggests that the infallibility of the House of Justice is confined to
the sphere of legislation. He argues further that, as far as he can dis-
cern, the House of Justice has legislated only a small number of times,
in each case, according to him, on an issue of “universal relevance”
through a decision-making process that did not need to draw on any
information obtained from fallible sources. Unfortunately, some
have taken his conclusions another step, suggesting that believers are
obliged to obey the House of Justice only in matters that fall within
the narrow range of such enactments.

In general, the House of Justice wishes to preserve the widest pos-
sible latitude for the friends to explore the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh
and to share their individual understanding of the Teachings. Yet it
must be remembered that, with regard to deductions drawn from the
Texts, the Master clearly states:

> …the deductions and conclusions of individual learned men
> have no authority, unless they are endorsed by the House
> of Justice. The difference is precisely this, that from the
> conclusions and endorsements of the body of the House
> of Justice whose members are elected by and known to the
> worldwide Bahá’í community, no differences will arise;
> whereas the conclusions of individual divines and scholars
> would definitely lead to differences, and result in schism,
> division, and dispersion. The oneness of the Word would
> be destroyed, the unity of the Faith would disappear, and
> the edifice of the Faith of God would be shaken.

The Universal House of Justice does not intend at this time to elaborate
further on previous explanations given of its duties and powers. That
the House of Justice itself does not find it necessary to do so should
alert the friends as to the unwisdom of their attempting to define so
precisely its sphere of action. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned
that, while there are explicit passages in the authoritative texts that
make reference to the infallibility of the House of Justice in the
enactment of legislation, the argument that it is free from error only
in this respect is untenable. Surely, the many emphatic statements
found in the Writings, such as the following excerpt from the Will
and Testament of `Abdu’l-Bahá, should suffice to dismiss any claims
of this kind:

Authority and Centrality of the Universal House of Justice

> The sacred and youthful branch, the guardian of the Cause
> of God as well as the Universal House of Justice, to be uni-
> versally elected and established, are both under the care and
> protection of the Abhá Beauty, under the shelter and unerr-
> ing guidance of His Holiness, the Exalted One (may my life
> be offered up for them both). Whatsoever they decide is of
> God. Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them, hath
> not obeyed God; whoso rebelleth against him and against
> them hath rebelled against God; whoso opposeth him hath
> opposed God; whoso contendeth with them hath contended
> with God….

Apart from the question of infallibility, there is the matter of author-
ity. A letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi states: “It is not for
individual believers to limit the sphere of the Guardian’s authority,
or to judge when they have to obey the Guardian and when they are
free to reject his judgement. Such an attitude would evidently lead to
confusion and to schism.” In regard to the Universal House of Justice,
the same understanding applies.

Infallibility is a profound spiritual concept inherent in the Bahá’í
Writings. In meditating upon the relevant passages, the believers will
naturally reach their own understanding of the subject. Individual
opinions, however, should not be imposed on others, nor so promoted
as to crystallize into doctrines not found in the explicit Text. When
exchanging views about the Universal House of Justice—the body to
which all things must be referred—the friends should exercise care
lest they go to extremes, by either diminishing its station or assigning
to it exaggerated attributes. What better admonition to heed in a

matter of this nature than that given by the beloved Master, when
some believers fell into disagreement about His own station:

> These discussions will yield no result or benefit: we must set
> all such debates and controversies entirely aside—nay, we
> must consign them to oblivion and arise to accomplish that
> which is enjoined and required in this Day. These debates are
> mere words bereft of inner meaning; they are mere illusions
> and not reality.

> That which is true and real is this: that we become united and
> agreed in our purpose and arise to flood this darksome world
> with light, to banish enmity and foreignness from among the
> children of men, to perfume and revive the world with the
> sanctified breezes of the character and conduct of the Abhá
> Beauty, to cast the light of divine guidance upon East and
> West, to raise the tabernacle of the love of God and gather
> all people under its sheltering shadow, to confer peace and
> composure upon every soul beneath the shade of the blessed
> Tree, to show forth such love as to astonish the enemy, to
> turn ravenous and bloodthirsty wolves into the gazelles of
> the meadows of the love of God, to cause the oppressor to
> taste the sweet savour of meekness, to teach them that kill
> the submission and acquiescence of those that suffer them-
> selves to be killed, to spread abroad the verses of the one true
> God, to extol the virtues and perfections of the all-glorious
> Lord, to raise to the highest heaven the cry of “O Thou the
> Glory of Glories!”, and to cause the call of “The earth will
> shine with the light of her Lord!”2 to reach the ears of the
> denizens of His Kingdom.

Authority and Centrality of the Universal House of Justice

The House of Justice appeals to the friends not to become embroiled
in the kind of fruitless theological discussions that caused conflict
and contention in past dispensations, lest they lose sight of their
responsibility to promulgate the oneness of humanity and of the role
of the Covenant established by Bahá’u’lláh in uniting minds, hearts,
and souls.
