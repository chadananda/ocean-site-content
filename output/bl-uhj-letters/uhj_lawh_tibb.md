## Tablet to a Physician (_Lawh-i-Tibb_)

Dear Bahá'í Friend,  
  
Your email of 14 December 1999, inquiring about a translation of Bahá'u'lláh's Tablet to a Physician subsequent to the one found in Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era, was received by the Universal House of Justice and referred to our Department for reply.  
  
Excerpts from Bahá'u'lláh's Tablet to a Physician appeared in Star of the West, volume 13, page 252, as well as in many and various Bahá'í newsletters and compilations, as an early translation of a portion of the Tablet entitled "Lawh-i-Tibb", revealed by Bahá'u'lláh in honour of Mirza Muhammad Rida Yazdi, a physician. However, until such time as conditions are propitious for the Tablet to be translated, only portions of it have an authorized translation. For your convenience, we are enclosing the text of the early, partial translation of the Tablet to a Physician which was published in Star of the West, as cited above, along with a related exhortation from Bahá'u'lláh taken from Star of the West, volume 21, number 5, page 160. Furthermore, it may interest you to know that the prayer starting with the words, "Thy Name is my healing ..." is also found in this Tablet.  
  
With regard to the Tablet, on 18 December 1945 a letter was written on behalf of the beloved Guardian to an individual believer stating:  
  
The Tablet to a Physician was addressed to a man who was a student of the old type of healing prevalent in the East and familiar with the terminology used in those days, and He addresses him in terms used by the medical men of those days. These terms are quite different from those used by modern medicine, and one would have to have a deep knowledge of this former school of medicine to understand the questions Bahá'u'lláh was elucidating.  
  
It is hoped that this information will be of assistance to you, and you may be assured of the loving prayers of the House of Justice in the Holy Shrines that the tender mercies of Bahá'u'lláh may surround you.  
  
      With loving Bahá'í greetings,

### Physical Healing

Some rules for health, from a Tablet revealed by Bahá'u'lláh.

> O God! The Supreme Knower! The Ancient Tongue speaks that which will satisfy the wise in the absence of doctors.  
>   
> O People, do not eat except when you are hungry. Do not drink after you have retired to sleep.  
>   
> Exercise is good when the stomach is empty; it strengthens the muscles. When the stomach is full it is very harmful.  
>   
> Do not neglect medical treatment, when it is necessary, but leave it off when the body is in good condition.  
>   
> Do not take nourishment except when (the process of) digestion is completed. Do not swallow until you have thoroughly masticated your food.  
>   
> Treat disease first of all through diet, and refrain from medicine. If you can find what you need for healing in a single herb do not use a compound medicine. Leave off medicine when the health is good, and use it in case of necessity.  
>   
> If two diametrically opposite foods are put on the table do not mix them. Be content with one of them. Take first the liquid food before partaking of solid food. The taking of food before that which you have already eaten is digested is dangerous....  
>   
> When you have eaten walk a little that the food may settle.  
>   
> That which is difficult to masticate is forbidden by the wise. Thus the Supreme Pen commands you.  
>   
> A light meal in the morning is as a light to the body.  
>   
> Avoid all harmful habits: they cause unhappiness in the world.  
>   
> Search for the causes of disease. This saying is the conclusion of this utterance.  
>       (Star of the West, vol. 13, no. 9, December 1922, p. 252)  
>   
> In God must be our trust. There is no God but Him, the Healer, the Knower, the Helper.... Nothing in earth or heaven is outside the grasp of God.  
>   
> O doctor! In treating the sick, first mention the name of God, the Possessor of the Day of Judgment, and then use what God hath destined for the healing of His creatures. By My Life! The doctor who has drunk from the Wine of My Love, his visit is healing, and his breath is mercy and hope. Cling to him for the welfare of the constitution. He is confirmed by God in his treatment.
