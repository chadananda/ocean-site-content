Training Institutes and Systematic Growth

a document prepared by
the International Teaching Centre

February 2000

51\.1   In its Rid.ván message of 153 [1996] the Universal House of        51.1

> Justice placed the establishment and development of training
> institutes in the context of the far-reaching changes that would
> characterize the progress of the Faith in this period of Bahá’í
> history.
51\.2      The next four years will represent an extraordinary period      51.2

> in the history of our Faith, a turning point of epochal
> magnitude. What the friends throughout the world are now
> being asked to do is to commit themselves, their material
> resources, their abilities and their time to the development
> of a network of training institutes on a scale never before
> attempted.1
51\.3       As we survey the development of training institutes during     51.3

> the Four Year Plan, we are struck by the degree to which this
> vision has been realized. The network of training institutes
> encircling the globe numbers some 350 in 170 countries, with
> nearly 100,000 believers having benefited from at least one
> institute course. The magnitude of this achievement is rivaled
> only by the “untold potential” that it augurs for the advance-
> ment of the process of entry by troops.
51\.4       The purpose of training institutes was clarified and           51.4

> elaborated in the April 1998 publication entitled “Training
> Institutes,” a document prepared for and approved by the
> Universal House of Justice. On the basis of this elucidation of
> the institute process, national communities began to refocus
> their efforts, emphasizing a sequence of courses that would cre-
> ate capacity and commitment on the part of the friends to carry
> out acts of service. Greater stress was placed on decentralizing

Turning Point

> the institute process so as to reach ever-growing numbers of
> believers. The past two years have seen not only the expansion
> of training institutes worldwide but a deeper appreciation
> throughout the Bahá’í world of the unique and vital role train-
> ing institutes must play in promoting systematic growth.
51\.5       This paper presents an overview of the advancement of the       51.5

> institute process since the release of the April 1998 document.
> The analysis is framed in the guidance the House of Justice
> has given to National Spiritual Assemblies during the past two
> years in relation to training institutes. It is divided into four
> sections:
1. Experience with the Institute Process

> 1.1 Administrative structure
> 1.2 Collaboration
1.3 Curriculum

> 1.3.1 A systematic approach
> 1.3.2 Sequence of courses
1.4 Delivery systems

> 1.4.1 Distance education
> 1.4.2 Study circles
> 1.4.3 Tutors and tutor training
2. Institutes in Action

> 2.1 Creating human resources
> 2.2 Impact on teaching and growth
> 2.3 Direct instruments of teaching
> 3. Systematization of Teaching (Area Growth Programs)
4. Challenges for Training Institutes

> 4.1 Quality and effectiveness
> 4.2 Illiteracy
> 4.3 Resource persons
> 4.4 Infrastructure
> 4.5 Deputization of institute staff

1. Experience with the Institute Process
51\.6       In its Rid.ván message of 156 [1999] the Universal House of     51.6

> Justice referred to the “demonstrated efficacy of training insti-
> tutes.” In order to better understand the long-range potential
> of the institutes and their impact on the progress of the Faith,

Additional Documents

> it may be worthwhile to consider the elements that characterize
> an effective training institute. What administrative structures
> have served well in implementing institute programs? What
> level of collaboration between the institutions of the Faith has
> helped to foster the institute process? Are there any principles
> of curriculum development that have been learned? Has any
> type of delivery system proved especially effective? To answer
> these questions, and others, we offer the experience of national
> communities around the world that have, under the guidance
> of the House of Justice, moved the development of training
> institutes forward with extraordinary rapidity and impressive
> results.
51\.7        The document “Training Institutes,” released by the              51.7

> House of Justice at the 1998 International Bahá’í Convention,
> described the variations in national communities and how
> the training institute might emerge differently according to
> the characteristics of different countries and the nature and
> size of their Bahá’í communities. However, the most striking
> observation that can be made when surveying the growth of
> training institutes around the world during the past two years
> is that there are important parallels among the most successful
> programs and there is a convergence of thought and practice
> about the development of training institutes that has emerged
> from implementation of the careful guidance given by the
> House of Justice to this worldwide enterprise.

1.1 Administrative structure
51\.8       In most countries of the world the basic administrative           51.8

> structure for the training institutes has been to establish a
> national institute with an institute board. In a few national
> communities that have large Bahá’í populations or that cover
> large geographical areas, and generally where Regional Bahá’í
> Councils exist, regional institutes have been established with
> their own boards. In the majority of these cases, National
> Spiritual Assemblies have decided that the institute boards
> report to the Regional Councils, while the National Assemblies
> themselves set broad policy and guide the overall development
> of the institute process.
51\.9       In all parts of the world the boards of training institutes       51.9

> have taken up their responsibilities with vigor, carrying out their
> tasks either under the supervision of the National Assembly
> or the appropriate Regional Council. They seem to have

Turning Point

> understood well the nature of their functions. Individuals who
> are appointed to the institute boards should have a readiness
> to learn about the challenges and promise of human resource
> development, be aware of the need to focus on training, and
> be able to work effectively in a small team. The collaboration
> of both arms of the Administrative Order in the appointment
> process has proved essential.
51\.10       If a board of directors is named, its membership should           51.10

> be decided upon by the National Spiritual Assembly in
> consultation with the Counsellors and with their full
> support. . . .2
51\.11       As Counsellors, National Assemblies, and the institute            51.11

> boards consider how to present courses to a growing number
> of believers, questions about the necessary administrative
> structures generally arise. The House of Justice has cautioned
> against an elaborate system of regional branches, which can be
> costly and generally still require believers to come to a central
> location:
51\.12       . . . at this stage in your efforts to raise up human resources   51.12

> it is not necessary to establish regional branches, which
> generally involve high costs, including maintenance of
> facilities, equipment, and expenses for participants, such as
> transportation, food and housing.3
51\.13   Rather than regional branches, an effective structure has been        51.13

> to appoint regional coordinators who oversee the extension
> of the institute courses to local communities within a region.
> As the number of study circles in an area increases, regional
> coordinators are needed to encourage and support the efforts
> of the tutors, to promote the further multiplication of study
> circles, and to coordinate the work of the institute with institu-
> tions in the area.
51\.14       In some national communities there had been a prolifera-          51.14

> tion of activities referred to as “institutes.” It was necessary to
> clarify that these local initiatives, largely focused on deepening,
> while praiseworthy, were not “institutes” as called for by the
> House of Justice. In this connection, it is important to draw a
> distinction between such initiatives and the extension of insti-
> tute courses to the local level as part of a national or regional
> program to provide training to ever-larger numbers of believers.

The House of Justice explains:

Additional Documents

51\.15       As the friends gain a clearer understanding of the intent        51.15

> of the House of Justice in calling for the establishment of
> institutes, these local efforts will gradually become associ-
> ated, as branches or study groups, with a regional institute
> serving a much larger population. In this context, what
> defines a region will necessarily vary. . . . Regardless, with
> the strengthening of regional institutes, the concept of a
> training institute will become more and more separated in
> the minds of the friends from that of a local deepening class
> or a teaching group.4

1.2 Collaboration
51\.16       In its Rid.ván 153 [1996] message and other letters, the         51.16

> House of Justice called for close collaboration between the two
> arms of the Administration in the development of institutes. In
> analyzing the growth and progress of training institutes during
> the Four Year Plan, one of the most compelling conclusions has
> been the importance of consultation between the Counsellors
> and National Assemblies about the direction and operation of
> the training institutes. To the degree to which close collabora-
> tion was achieved, there was a corresponding likelihood that
> the training institute process would be firmly grounded in the
> guidance of the House of Justice and would experience success
> in creating a body of confirmed and active supporters of the
> Faith.
51\.17       In a national community there must exist a common vision         51.17

> between the Counsellors and the National Spiritual Assembly
> about the character and direction of the institute process. This
> has been achieved where there has been “intimate involve-
> ment in institute operations” by the Counsellors and their
> auxiliaries. Furthermore, the collaboration of Counsellors with
> those Regional Bahá’í Councils that have responsibility for
> administering regional training institutes, and of Counsellors
> and Auxiliary Board members with training institute boards,
> has provided the opportunity for this arm of the Administration
> to further its sacred purpose of diffusing the Divine Fragrances
> and promoting learning. As explained in the Rid.ván 153 [1996]
> message, the character of institutes “harmonizes with, and pro-
> vides scope for the exercise of, the educational responsibilities
> of the Auxiliary Board members.”5

Turning Point

51\.18       The House of Justice has emphasized in several instances         51.18

> the necessity of the ongoing collaboration between the two
> arms of the Administration:
51\.19          This matter calls for an intensification of the collabora-    51.19

> tion between the Continental Counsellors and National
> Spiritual Assemblies. For the success of these training
> institutes will depend in very large measure on the ac-
> tive involvement of the Continental Counsellors and the
> Auxiliary Board members in their operation. Particularly
> will it be necessary for Auxiliary Board members to have a
> close working relationship with institutes. . . .6
51\.20      A process of decision-making must be arrived at, in con-          51.20

> sultation between you and the Counsellors, regarding the
> preparation and approval of the annual plans and budgets
> for the institutes. This would involve in each case, of
> course, close interaction between the Counsellors and the
> institutes or institute boards. . . .7
51\.21       In the functioning of the training institute boards we           51.21

> have witnessed the close cooperation of the two arms of the
> Administration, particularly the participation of Auxiliary
> Board members, fulfilling the House of Justice’s expectation
> that the “intimate involvement in institute operations should
> now become a part of the evolving functions of these officers
> of the Faith.”8
51\.22          From these guidelines, you can see that it is entirely        51.22

> acceptable for Auxiliary Board members to be appointed by
> the National Assembly in agreement with the Counsellors
> to the board of an institute. Of course, their participation in
> the institute work is not limited to membership on boards
> of directors. As mentioned in your letter, many will also
> serve as coordinators and act as teachers. Whether they
> take up these responsibilities on a full-time basis is a matter
> for them to decide in consultation with the Counsellors
> concerned.9
51\.23       In most countries Auxiliary Board members are serving on         51.23

> institute boards. However, it is in those places where the guid-
> ance of the House of Justice on the critical role of the Board
> members in the development of the institute process has been
> fully implemented that one can observe the greatest progress.

Additional Documents

51\.24       In countries where Regional Bahá’í Councils exist, close          51.24

> interaction between the Councils and the training institutes is
> vitally important and can create “a galvanic coherence of the
> processes effecting expansion and consolidation in a region,”
> and “the practical matching of the training services of institutes
> to the developmental needs of local communities.”10

1.3 Curriculum
51\.25       At the heart of the training institute is the curriculum se-      51.25

> lected by the institute board, in consultation with the National
> Spiritual Assembly and the Counsellors.
51\.26       In view of the experience gained thus far, you are urged to       51.26

> outline, in consultation with Counsellors and the boards,
> a sequence of a few courses designed to endow the friends
> in your community with the spiritual insights, knowledge
> and skills needed to serve the Faith with increasing
> effectiveness.11
51\.27        Since any curriculum is a vehicle for achieving educational      51.27

> goals, the most effective curriculum for institutes has proved to
> be one that truly trains the believers for service in the fields of
> expansion and consolidation. Early on in the Four Year Plan
> it became apparent in many countries that although deepening
> was essential and must continue, the in-depth study of a book
> or specialized subject in the institutes would not necessarily
> result in mobilizing large numbers of Bahá’ís to become active
> teachers. There are, of course, many important subjects in
> which believers need to deepen, but the House of Justice in
> several letters has discouraged training institutes from incorpo-
> rating specialized topics into their programs at the expense of a
> focus on a basic sequence of courses.
51\.28           The House of Justice has reservations, however, on            51.28

> the desirability of involving the Training Institutes in this
> program. The Training Institutes should be developing and
> applying a coherent, systematic program for increasing the
> human resources of the Bahá’í community. Naturally, as
> part of such a curriculum there will be place for including
> reference to the law of H   . uqúqu’lláh and the whole mat-
> ter of supporting the funds of the Faith as a part of the
> individual life of the believer and an essential element of
> Bahá’í community life. However, to involve the Training
> Institutes in a specific project of educating the members of

Turning Point

> the community in the law of H   . uqúqu’lláh, or in preparing
> training materials, would seem to be a diversion of their
> main task.12
51\.29            In designing the program for the education of the             51.29

> members of the Bahá’í community in the Teachings, and
> in selecting the curricula of summer schools and similar
> occasions, a National Spiritual Assembly should include
> all aspects of life, including the choosing of a spouse, but
> the House of Justice feels that it is important for this to be
> done in context. It is not felt, however, that this special-
> ized subject is one which would be suitable for training
> institutes, which have their own clearly defined purpose.13

1.3.1 A systematic approach
51\.30       The April 1998 document on training institutes indicates           51.30

> that it is a complex task to design curriculum materials that
> combine the acquisition of knowledge and skills with the culti-
> vation of inner qualities in a sequence that gradually prepares
> believers for higher and higher levels of service. For this reason
> national communities were encouraged to utilize materials
> already prepared in other parts of the world that employed a
> systematic approach and were designed to empower believers
> to arise and serve.
51\.31            The House of Justice is greatly encouraged by the pro-        51.31

> posed plan of activities of your institute and is particularly
> pleased to note that it is concentrating on the execution of
> its program, which draws upon readily available materials,
> and has not allowed its energies to be consumed in planning
> and design.14
51\.32        As part of its mandate to assess institute curricula that         51.32

> are available in the Bahá’í world, the International Teaching
> Centre has found the Ruhi Institute materials to be particularly
> appropriate. Many national communities are using the Ruhi
> Institute curriculum either as the focus of their training institute
> or as one of its tracks of study.
51\.33        The Ruhi Institute curriculum had been tested and adapted         51.33

> over many years. It has enabled the friends in different coun-
> tries to get the institute system up and running in a short time.
> Rather than having the participants be passive listeners to a
> wide array of unconnected talks, the Ruhi Institute materials
> seek to engage the friends fully in the process of learning.

Additional Documents

> Bahá’ís with diverse cultural and educational backgrounds
> have found the curriculum’s deceptively simple approach, based
> heavily on connecting the believers to the Creative Word, both
> appealing and empowering.
51\.34       Even in those countries where the Ruhi Institute materials       51.34

> have been chosen as the main curriculum or as one of the insti-
> tute tracks, modifications and adaptations for local conditions
> have occasionally been made. In a few countries a beginning
> course has been developed for new believers which precedes
> Book 1. In some areas the Ruhi Institute books have been sup-
> plemented with other materials to suit the local requirements.
> Over time, through systematic educational experience, other
> sequential curricula will be developed in various parts of the
> world that display the same coherence that the Ruhi Institute
> materials have achieved but are derived from the experience of
> different national communities.

1.3.2 Sequence of courses
51\.35       The Universal House of Justice has stressed the importance       51.35

> of a sequence of courses in preparing the friends for the expan-
> sion and consolidation work:
51\.36       . . . it may be timely for you to consider introducing another   51.36

> component into your institute program. Unlike the courses
> designed for deepening the generality of the believers, this
> component would be concerned with helping a certain per-
> centage of the friends, especially young people with some
> formal education, enhance their capacity to perform the
> tasks associated with an accelerated process of expansion
> and consolidation. It would entail choosing a sequence of
> courses which, building on one another, gradually endow
> the students with the knowledge, skills and qualities needed
> to serve the Faith with increasing effectiveness.15
51\.37       Great strides have been made in involving the friends in         51.37

> training institute courses, but more attention needs to be given
> to ensure that they systematically proceed through a sequence
> of courses.
51\.38       Once the sequence has been selected, a steadily increasing       51.38

> number of believers are recruited to enter the first basic
> course, and relatively significant percentages are then helped

> to reach higher and higher courses, enhancing thereby their
> capacity for service.16
51\.39       In countries with small Bahá’í populations a large number       51.39

> of the friends have taken not only one course but completed
> successive courses in a sequence. However, experience has
> shown that in countries with large Bahá’í populations, most
> participants study only the first level course. In a community
> like India, where about 34,000 believers have completed level
> one, this is undoubtedly a great achievement. Nevertheless, as
> the number of those entering the institute program steadily
> increases, so too should the percentage of believers who go on
> to study the subsequent courses in the sequence. In this way,
> the development of human resources is characterized by the
> image of an ever-expanding pyramid. The size of the “pyramid”
> is an indication of a national community’s success in creating
> human resources to meet its needs for the tasks of expansion
> and consolidation.
51\.40       In countries where the human resources are growing, other       51.40

> tracks of study, in addition to the basic sequence of courses,
> have been introduced. These tracks may focus on such areas as
> children’s education, literacy training, or health.

1.4 Delivery systems
51\.41       Worldwide, the Bahá’ís have experimented with different         51.41

> types of delivery systems in order to extend the reach of their
> national or regional training institutes. In addition to courses
> in central locations, several distance education delivery systems
> have been successfully implemented in a number of countries.
> These include extension courses, where the program of the
> national institute is held in an area that can draw on Bahá’ís
> from a cluster of villages or towns; institute campaigns, where
> an intensive series of classes is given at the local level over a
> period of a few weeks; and study circles, where a small group of
> believers come together on a regular basis in their own locality
> with a trained tutor who helps them to progress through a
> selected sequence of courses.

1.4.1 Distance education
51\.42       During the first two years of the Four Year Plan, in the        51.42

> early stages in the establishment of many institutes, groups
> of believers were brought to one central facility, either in the

> capital or in a regional center, for a week or a few weekends
> to attend training courses and then returned to their home
> communities. It became apparent, however, that the number
> of believers who would be able to obtain training with this
> approach soon reaches a limit. Whether because of the sheer
> numbers of friends that must pass through the training or
> because of the cost and inconvenience of traveling and staying
> in a residential program, distance education has proved to be an
> effective delivery system. In many instances the House of Justice
> has stressed the value of this decentralized approach:
51\.43       What can expand the institute’s coverage is for a sequence       51.43

> of a few well-conceived courses to be selected and a band of
> tutors trained, who then offer the courses at the local level
> throughout the region to groups of eager believers. In this
> way, the number of those studying in the institute program
> at various levels steadily increases.17
51\.44       A decentralized approach to the delivery of courses does         51.44

> not transfer responsibility for training to the local institutions
> but is a system adopted by the national or regional institute
> to extend its program to the grassroots. In several cases, the
> House of Justice has clarified the intent of decentralization as
> described in the April 1998 document “Training Institutes”:
51\.45       The solution does not seem to be the establishment of local      51.45

> institutes, independent of the national institute. . . . these
> run the danger of turning into deepening classes. This is not
> to say that every local community should not continue to
> conduct regular deepening programs. But, as far as human
> resource development is concerned, the methodology that
> seems to be most effective in reaching believers at the local
> level is the formation of study circles which are coordinated
> by a national institute or one of its branches.18

1.4.2 Study circles
51\.46       Of the three above-mentioned delivery systems, the most          51.46

> widely practiced on all continents is the study circle, sometimes
> called a study group, a circle of study, or a circle of learning.
> The House of Justice has encouraged this flexible, low cost
> form of distance education:
51\.47       Initially, such courses might need to be offered at the insti-   51.47

tute sites, but, as a growing number of tutors are trained,

> study circles could eventually be formed throughout the
> country. Such a system of distance-education seems par-
> ticularly well suited to the geographical makeup of Papua
> New Guinea.19
51\.48       . . . the system of delivery of courses through study circles, a    51.48

> system which we understand the national institute of Bolivia
> is attempting to gradually establish throughout the country,
> is designed to bring the institute courses to the level of each
> locality. In this case, a sequence of courses is offered to small
> groups of believers in villages and towns by tutors trained by
> the institute itself or a branch operating in the region. Efforts
> to put into place such a vast system can only flourish in an
> environment characterized by a spirit of unity and collabora-
> tion among all the institutions of the Faith.20
51\.49       A distinguishing feature of study circles is that in many           51.49

> countries, and across diverse cultures, they have created a new
> dynamic within the community and have become nuclei of com-
> munity life and catalysts for teaching, service, and community
> development. In addition to study of the institute courses, the
> members of the study circle, both Bahá’ís and non-Bahá’ís,
> often participate in service and extracurricular activities that
> bind the group together in fellowship and attract others to
> this mode of learning. Having experienced the participatory
> learning style of the courses, the members of the study circle
> gradually take on a stronger commitment to actively serve and
> apply the knowledge and skills they are gaining to the work of
> the Faith. Some members of study circles are eventually trained
> as tutors and then initiate their own study circles.
51\.50       After studying one course, many of the members of a                 51.50

> study circle will stay together to go on to the next course, but
> some may drop out until they are ready and able to pursue a
> subsequent course. As friends move on to higher level courses,
> and other friends join at various points in the sequence, the
> membership of a study circle can gradually change. Although
> members of study circles will often engage in social and service
> activities together, no feelings of exclusivity should be allowed
> to develop among them. Furthermore, the study circles should
> be guided by the spirit of consultation in planning recreation,
> teaching, and service activities.
51\.51       Since a key purpose of the study circle is to raise human           51.51

resources that are to be utilized in the community, the Local

> Spiritual Assemblies, the area teaching committees, and the
> Auxiliary Board members will need to know where they are lo-
> cated and draw on their members for the tasks of teaching and
> consolidation. Several letters written on behalf of the House of
> Justice address the importance of collaboration in supporting
> the friends in their teaching endeavors:
51\.52       . . . in a locality where the Local Spiritual Assembly is func-     51.52

> tioning, it would collaborate with the national institute or
> its branch in supporting the work of the study circles, while
> pursuing its own plans for the expansion and consolidation
> of the Cause.21
51\.53        Personal teaching requires stimulation from the institutions;      51.53

> it must be fostered by National and Local Spiritual Assemblies,
> on the one hand, and the Counsellors and their auxiliaries, on
> the other. The institutions should also nurture and support
> the members of study circles and other individuals in the com-
> munity in acts of service that come about through personal
> initiative.

1.4.3 Tutors and tutor training
51\.54        The experience of the past few years has shown that the            51.54

> selection and training of tutors are crucial for the extension
> of the institute process to the grassroots and for the success of
> the study circles. In many parts of the world this realization
> has led to a focus on raising up an ever-growing number of
> tutors, either from among the participants in the study circles
> or, initially, from experienced believers who take part in events
> that combine institute courses with tutor training.
51\.55        Since the effectiveness of the tutors is critical to the success   51.55

> of the institute process, more and more attention has been given
> to the content of the training, the skills needed to organize
> a study circle and lead the participants through the courses,
> and the attitudes necessary both to nurture the participants in
> their learning and maintain the cohesion of the group. Tutors
> require training in how to keep the participants focused on the
> material, how to formulate questions that stimulate reflection,
> and how to foster active participation within the group. They
> need to combine the qualities of love, humility, and patience,
> with the dedication, perseverance, and commitment required to
> create a spiritual atmosphere conducive to learning. It should
> be emphasized that tutor training is not a one-time event but

> an ongoing activity where tutors come together periodically to
> share experiences and ideas. In many countries educated youth
> have proved to be an excellent source for institute tutors.
51\.56       Regional coordinators, who often come from the ranks of            51.56

> tutors, will need these same abilities, plus some administrative
> capacity to maintain records, track the progress of the study
> circles, organize training programs, supervise tutors, and
> coordinate the work of the institute with the activities of the
> institutions in the area.

> 2. Institutes in Action
> 2.1 Creating human resources
51\.57        As believers in each country advance through a sequence of        51.57

> courses and their skills and abilities are enhanced, the respon-
> sibility then falls on the institutions of the Faith to see that the
> energies, talents, and newly acquired skills of these friends are
> channeled in some form of active service to the Cause. In this
> regard, the House of Justice has pointed out:
51\.58       Ample opportunities should be given to them to put into            51.58

> practice what they have learned, and in this connection, you
> will need to create within your community an encouraging
> environment, one in which the friends feel empowered to
> step forward, whatever their capacities may be, and take up
> the work of the Faith.22
51\.59        One of the most exciting aspects of a review of the ac-           51.59

> complishments of the Four Year Plan has been to survey the
> development of the training institutes worldwide and to take
> note of the successes national communities have reported in ad-
> vancing the process of entry by troops. Each continent has had
> its own challenges and record of achievements in the growth of
> training institutes. Overall, however, a pattern of the institute
> process has emerged that is not confined to one country or part
> of the world but represents a common direction for the Bahá’í
> world in its development of human resources.
51\.60        Previously Africa had several years of experience with insti-     51.60

> tutes, but a shift had to be made from offering deepening courses
> to establishing training programs. In order to implement this
> new orientation, a focus was placed on tutor training and the
> translation of institute materials into French and Portuguese,
> as well as many local languages. Training institutes in several

> national communities in Africa have made significant advances,
> extending the reach of the institute process throughout each
> country while also initiating social and economic development
> activities. The Uganda Bahá’í Institute for Development has an
> impressive delivery system of courses; more than 1,500 friends
> have completed a level one course and 35 percent of them have
> gone through higher level courses. In Zambia the training
> institute has had similar success. Nearly 1,000 individuals have
> completed the first course and one-third of these participants
> have completed higher courses in the sequence. Both Uganda
> and Zambia have systematically trained tutors—185 and 144

respectively—in order to support their delivery systems.
51\.61       The Americas have witnessed a tremendous acceleration            51.61

> in the creation of human resources. There are more than
> 500 study circles in Latin America, and nearly 1,000 tutors
> have been trained. In Brazil alone the development of human
> resources has been impressive: there are 568 tutors and 260
> study circles, with more than 5,000 believers participating in
> the institute process of which some 400 are junior youth. The
> Ruhi Institute, located in Colombia, has provided training to
> more than 40 members of National Assemblies and institute
> boards and has prepared a group of 16 resource persons who
> can advise institutes in different countries about their programs.
> In the United States, training in the methodology of the Core
> Curriculum, one of the tracks of the institutes in that country,
> has been provided to Bahá’ís from more than 52 countries.
51\.62       In all 39 countries of Asia that have National Assemblies,       51.62

> training institutes have been established and have recorded the
> highest levels of participation, in terms of absolute numbers
> as well as percentages. Approximately 60,000 friends have
> attended at least one training institute course, and of those,
> some 34,000 were in India. Nepal has shown a high degree
> of participation with approximately 20 percent of the Bahá’ís
> having completed the level one course. In Russia and the other
> countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States a large
> percentage of the national communities have attended at least
> one institute course—for example, 60 percent of the Bahá’ís
> in Armenia and 35 percent of the friends in Kazakhstan. In
> the Arabian countries, partly because of the small size of their
> communities, the percentages rise even higher—76 percent in
> Bahrain, 43 percent in Kuwait, and 36 percent in Oman.

51\.63        This widespread involvement of the believers in the institutes     51.63

> is reflected in the achievements the national communities have
> made in the translation of curriculum into local languages—
> 14 in India, 10 in Southeast Asia, and 5 in Central Asia. Most of
> the institutes in Asia, as in Africa, have also developed distinct
> tracks in their institutes so that in addition to a basic sequence,
> there are programs for literacy training, moral classes, and in
> some cases “higher learning” courses.
51\.64        Like the institutes in Africa, those in Australasia are focusing   51.64

> their energies increasingly on the offering of training ­programs,
> rather than deepening courses alone. Outside resource persons
> are being utilized to train English- and French-speaking tutors
> for Australia, New Zealand, and 10 Pacific islands. A sequence
> of courses and study circles have been established in several
> states of Australia and on the major islands of Hawaii. In
> Papua New Guinea the institute organized an efficient network
> for delivering courses, mostly deepening in nature, to nearly
> two-thirds of the believers. Now the institute is focusing on
> delivering a sequence of courses that will train a percentage of
> these friends in the tasks of expansion and consolidation.
51\.65        Europe refocused its training institutes on a sequence of          51.65

> courses and a decentralized delivery system. From the Baltics to
> the Balkans a host of 125 tutors has been trained and continent-
> wide resource persons are also being identified to assist national
> communities with training institutes. Over a nine-month period
> 12 regional tutor training seminars were held in England,
> France, Germany, Spain, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Albania,
> Romania, and Belarus. Out of this effort scores of study circles
> have been launched in country after country.

2.2 Impact on teaching and growth
51\.66       Although there is always a range of factors that contribute         51.66

> to growth in a community, reports of achievements in the teach-
> ing field from Counsellors and National Assemblies indicate
> that these developments are increasingly influenced, either
> directly or indirectly, by the institute process.
51\.67       In Bangladesh, where the training institute process is well         51.67

> established, over 11,000 believers entered the Faith in the third
> year of the Four Year Plan. A survey carried out by members
> of the institutions in that country determined that nearly 8,000
> of these enrollments were the result of individual teaching
> by institute participants, particularly the tutors. In South

> Africa, it has been reported that between the first two years
> of the Four Year Plan and the third year of the Plan, when the
> institute process was well under way, there was an increase of
> 40 percent in the number of new enrollments. The National
> Spiritual Assembly has concluded that this level of growth is
> due primarily to individual initiative stimulated by the training
> institute courses.
51\.68        Local teaching projects and teaching campaigns have been         51.68

> taken up with increasing vigor and have provided a major
> avenue of service for institute participants. In addition to the 30
> percent increase since 1998 in the number of teaching projects
> funded by the Teaching Centre, news of several hundred locally
> initiated projects, many of them self-supporting, demonstrated
> the upswing in the tempo of teaching in different parts of the
> world.
51\.69        Reports also suggest that there has been a marked increase       51.69

> in the number of firesides around the world, an indication of
> the level of teaching undertaken at the initiative of the indi-
> vidual. In Ireland a national program entitled “Core Project,”
> whose goal is to establish 20 firesides, has been operating in
> conjunction with a series of training institute courses. A similar
> trend has been noted in Slovakia, which launched a national
> fireside campaign during the last year of the Four Year Plan. In
> the southern region of the United States individual initiative has
> manifested itself in a growing number of firesides, particularly
> by institute participants. There has also been a notable rise in
> the number of firesides across the southern part of Australia in
> Victoria, New South Wales, and Western Australia, as well as
> in some island communities of the Pacific, such as Tonga, where
> over 660 souls have entered the Faith in the last three years.
> The National Spiritual Assembly of Japan has far exceeded its
> fireside goal for the Four Year Plan.
51\.70        Parallel to this, and contributing to the overall spiritual      51.70

> atmosphere needed for teaching and growth, is the dramatic
> increase in the number of devotional meetings worldwide.
> The April 1998 document on training institutes mentions the
> establishment of devotional meetings as one of the first acts of
> service that those who have completed institute courses can
> carry out. Such meetings have been initiated in several countries
> of Asia, where hundreds exist in India alone, and in many
> countries of Latin America.

2.3 Direct instruments of teaching
51\.71        In the same document on training institutes it was suggested    51.71

> that Bahá’í communities that are small in size but have a large
> percentage of knowledgeable believers consider having their in-
> stitutes open courses to non-Bahá’ís. A number of enrollments
> directly resulting from institute courses have been reported in
> countries such as France, Greece, Korea, and Nepal, as well as
> in countries with larger Bahá’í populations such as Ethiopia,
> Taiwan, Turkey, and the United States. In addition, the Baltic
> States, Belarus, Finland, and the Ukraine are opening some of
> their courses to non-Bahá’ís. Countries that have experienced
> large-scale expansion, such as India, Bangladesh, and the
> Philippines, are also benefiting from this approach to teaching.
> These countries have found that the majority of non-Bahá’ís
> who participate in the institute programs accept the Faith by
> the completion of the first course.

3. Systematization of Teaching

(Area Growth Programs)
51\.72       In order to realize the potential for growth that the training   51.72

> of human resources has brought about, attention must be given
> to the systematization of teaching efforts. In its message to the
> Bahá’ís of the world announcing the Twelve Month Plan and
> the Five Year Plan, the House of Justice presented this challenge
> to communities:
51\.73           It is essential that, during the one-year effort, national   51.73

> and regional institutes everywhere bring into full operation
> the programs and systems that they have now devised.
> National communities should enter the Five Year Plan con-
> fident that the acquisition of knowledge, qualities and skills
> of service by large contingents of believers, with the aid
> of a sequence of courses, will proceed unhindered. Ample
> attention must also be given to further systematization of
> teaching efforts, whether undertaken by the individual or
> directed by the institutions.23
51\.74       With the further systematization of teaching efforts in mind,    51.74

> the International Teaching Centre has identified certain patterns
> of expansion and consolidation that lead to a process of ac-
> celerated and sustained growth. This approach to systematized
> teaching is being developed in the context of an “Area Growth

> Program,” which focuses on a relatively small geographical
> area with a manageable number of localities. At the heart of the
> Area Growth Program is a systematic institute process under
> the direction of the national or regional institute. As a growing
> number of believers pass through the courses of the training in-
> stitute, the pool of human resources for various expansion and
> consolidation undertakings increases. Auxiliary Board members
> and their assistants will encourage these believers to utilize their
> newly acquired capabilities in teaching the Faith and in acts of
> service, such as holding devotional meetings, deepening one’s
> fellow believers, and conducting children’s classes. Grassroots
> involvement, where the local believers consult together, take ac-
> tion, and support one another in individual or group activities,
> is a fundamental characteristic of an Area Growth Program.
51\.75        Institute participants, as well as other local believers, will    51.75

> take part in area-wide seminars and conferences, regional
> teaching campaigns, and small socio-economic development
> projects. Gradually, local collective endeavors will emerge, area
> committees and Local Spiritual Assemblies will formulate their
> own plans for expansion and consolidation, and the friends will
> begin to shoulder the responsibilities of systematic growth in
> their communities.
51\.76        The process of learning about growth that was launched            51.76

> with the Four Year Plan has confirmed the vision the House of
> Justice gave in its Rid. ván message of 153 [1996] that advanc-
> ing the process of entry by troops depends on raising up large
> numbers of trained believers. As increasing numbers of Bahá’ís
> go through the institute courses and, in so doing, develop a
> stronger Bahá’í identity and desire to serve, a dynamic for
> growth is created in our communities. Even if only a fraction of
> the participants become active teachers, having more and more
> Bahá’ís proceed through a sequence of courses generates a spirit
> that motivates the believers and revitalizes the community. For
> this reason the strategy of the Area Growth Programs is to
> have the teaching and expansion work revolve around the
> institutes.

4. Challenges for Training Institutes
51\.77       The extraordinary growth of institutes around the world            51.77

> has brought with it a number of challenges. Some of these are
> general issues that many communities face while others are

> specific to continents or individual countries. A general prior-
> ity is for national communities to reflect on the achievements
> of their institutes, to assess the efficacy of their approaches,
> and to modify certain elements in light of experience or new
> circumstances. This analysis and reflection should take place
> periodically between National Assemblies and Counsellors and
> by institute boards, Auxiliary Board members, and Regional
> Councils where applicable.

4.1 Quality and effectiveness
51\.78       During the Four Year Plan, most national communities             51.78

> worked on the establishment and initial functioning of the
> institute process. At the start, a focus on generating institu-
> tional capacity to deliver a few basic courses generally took
> precedence over a concern with program quality. Gradually,
> increasing attention is being given to the challenge of striking
> a balance between quantity and quality. While it remains a
> priority to think in terms of reaching large numbers of friends
> with the institute program, attention at the same time must be
> given to improving its overall effectiveness. As institutes strive
> to upgrade the quality of training and the delivery of courses,
> they will come closer to fulfilling the aim of raising up “large
> numbers of believers who are trained to foster and facilitate the
> process of entry by troops with efficiency and love.”24

4.2 Illiteracy
51\.79       A great number of countries suffer from low literacy rates.      51.79

> In some populations or areas, the rate is so low as to pose a
> challenge to the institute process. The House of Justice has
> stressed that institutes need not be held back at the outset
> because of this concern.
51\.80       It should be remembered that not every believer in Tanzania      51.80

> will necessarily participate in your institute program.
> Rather, a certain percentage of the friends will need to
> receive training in order to enhance their capacity to carry
> out the tasks of expansion and consolidation, including the
> teaching and deepening of the generality of the believers. At
> this early stage in the establishment of the institute, then,
> the question of illiteracy should not be a central concern.
> The immediate challenge before you is to help a large
> number of the many capable members of your community,

> especially young people with some formal education, prog-
> ress through a sequence of a few basic courses. Once this
> has been accomplished, it may be possible for the institute
> to expand its program to include a second track of courses
> for the development of human resources in the area of
> social and economic development, including literacy.25
51\.81         Although the present institute courses are geared to          51.81

> believers with basic education, efforts to address problems of
> illiteracy can be given more attention as the institute develops,
> possibly through offering a literacy course in a track for social
> and economic development. This would ensure that there will
> continue to be a ready population to undergo training and also
> guarantee that certain groups with a high degree of illiteracy,
> such as women, are not left behind in the process of developing
> human resources.

4.3 Resource persons
51\.82       Institute resource persons are Bahá’ís who have had             51.82

> substantial training and national level experience in the
> development of training institutes. The last two years of the
> Four Year Plan witnessed a greater appreciation by the institu-
> tions of the Faith of the use of resource persons. Deployed at
> the discretion of the Continental Boards of Counsellors, they
> have played a significant and beneficial role in consulting with
> national and regional institutions about the institute process
> and in the training of coordinators and tutors. Excellent results
> have been achieved from such training programs on all five
> continents. The Teaching Centre would like to see a core of
> such individuals on every continent, available to assist institu-
> tions with clarifying concepts, training tutors, and enhancing
> the capacity of institutes. These outside consultants, however,
> are no substitute for the process of evaluation and reflection
> that National Assemblies, together with the Counsellors, must
> undertake and sustain in order for the training institutes to
> become fully indigenous and institutionalized.

4.4 Infrastructure
51\.83       In the initial stages in the growth of an institute there has   51.83

> not been an emphasis on acquiring buildings for the program.

In this respect the House of Justice has indicated:

51\.84           With regard to the permanent training institute, you         51.84

> will need office space to maintain the files and administra-
> tion of this organization, but the institute courses will
> need to reach a widely spread Bahá’í population. Access
> to physical facilities for institute courses will of course be
> necessary, but should probably not require the acquisition
> of permanent institute buildings. . . . The House of Justice
> is concerned that matters related to the acquisition and
> maintenance of a new institute building . . . would require
> resources which would be better used for the development
> of the institute program itself.26
51\.85       During the past four years similar advice from the House         51.85

> of Justice has also been given to national communities with
> extensive institute programs. However, as the 26 December
> 1995 message to the Conference of the Continental Boards
> of Counsellors indicated, the institute, “at some stage of its
> development, may require a building of its own.”27 No doubt
> the question of infrastructure will soon need to be considered
> carefully, particularly in countries where large numbers of
> friends are moving through a sequence of courses.
51\.86       The question of infrastructure is related not only to build-     51.86

> ings but also to arrangements needed to maintain records and
> statistics, to stay in contact with students, and to put in place
> an efficient tracking system. The House of Justice has com-
> mented on such developments:
51\.87       It now wishes us to commend you on the steps you have            51.87

> taken to create a Desk at your National Office dedicated
> to the systematization and dissemination of information
> on human resource development. Keeping the community
> informed of the status of your institute program and the
> accomplishments of those taking part in it will help you
> considerably to maintain enthusiasm among the friends for
> training. In this and many other ways, the Human Resource
> Desk will undoubtedly be of great assistance to you.28

4.5 Deputization of institute staff
51\.88        In addition to collaborating with National Assemblies on        51.88

> the areas of budget, management, curriculum, and course deliv-
> ery, Counsellors and Auxiliary Board members have been called
> upon to arouse the commitment of the friends to promote the
> teaching work through the deputization of institute staff, an

> opportunity introduced by the Universal House of Justice in
> its Rid. ván 153 [1996] message. This new measure has given
> the friends yet another avenue to fulfill Bahá’u’lláh’s injunction
> to propagate the Faith of God and that “Whoso is unable, it
> is his duty to appoint him who will, in his stead, proclaim this
> Revelation. . . .” The House of Justice has explained how the
> call for deputization falls within the framework of teaching and
> depends on individual response:
51\.89            With the creation of training institutes across the globe,   51.89

> an added opportunity for a more direct involvement in
> deputization presents itself to the individual; the House of
> Justice trusts therefore that the friends can be helped to feel
> some connection with the specific centers of teaching activ-
> ity to which their offerings for deputization are sent.29
51\.90       Although local, regional and national institutions are            51.90

> informing the friends of the importance of their sacred teach-
> ing obligation and of the opportunities for deputization, the
> Counsellors and Auxiliary Board members are in an advanta-
> geous position to reach individuals at the grassroots and
> summon forth their interest and commitment to this worldwide
> enterprise. The House of Justice has explained:
51\.91       It is for this reason that the Continental Counsellors and        51.91

> their auxiliaries have been called upon to play a distinctive
> role in this matter as officers bearing a particular respon-
> sibility for propagation, for the Auxiliary Board members
> and their assistants operate at the grassroots of the commu-
> nity and are able readily not only to stimulate individuals to
> teach but also to urge them, if their material circumstances
> allow, to respond to the need for deputization.30
51\.92       It is up to the Counsellors and Board members to provide          51.92

> the friends with detailed information about current needs for
> deputization, including the level of support required by institute
teachers in various parts of the world.

***
51\.93       In conclusion, it might be said that the “dynamic state           51.93

> of transformation” referred to in the Rid. ván 156 [1999]
> message aptly describes the impact of training institutes on
> our communities during the Four Year Plan. The institute has
> become central to the life of the community and is beginning
> to generate human resources to a degree that was not imagined

> at the outset of the Plan. Clearly it is the institute process
> that is at the core of the coherent vision that is guiding us in
> advancing the process of entry by troops. As the House of
> Justice expressed in the same message: “Understanding of the
> necessity for systematization in the development of human
> resources is everywhere taking hold.”31 It is also understood
> that the process upon which we have embarked through the
> training institutes is a long-term one.
51\.94       The learning that has taken place about the systematic          51.94

> development of human resources will now be extended to the
> process of learning about the systematization of teaching.
> Through the implementation of Area Growth Programs around
> the world a new body of experience will emerge that will inform
> our approach to teaching and our strategies about growth for
> the next two decades. These efforts at systematic and unabated
> action represent the deep desire and commitment of every
> Bahá’í “to fulfill the intentions of a Plan whose major aim is to
> accelerate that process which will make it possible for growing
> numbers of the world’s people to find the Object of their quest
> and thus to build a united, peaceful and prosperous life.”32
