Dear Bahá'í Friend,

We have received your letter stating you were disturbed by statements made in your deepening class regarding the infallibility of the beloved Guardian and we appreciate your concern.

According to your letter, this question arose in connection with Shoghi Effendi's references in GOD PASSES BY to historical events, and his descriptions of the characters of opponents of the Faith, particularly that of Haji Mirza Aqasi. Letters written on behalf of the Guardian by his secretary to individuals who asked similar questions clearly define the sphere of the Guardian's infallibility. We quote from two of these, one written in 1944, and the second in in 1956.

> "The infallibility of the Guardian is confined to matters which are related strictly to the Cause and interpretations of the Teachings; he is not an infallible authority on other subjects, such as economics, science, etc."
> 
> "The Guardian's infallibility covers interpretation of the revealed word, and its application. Likewise any instructions he may issue having to do with the protection of the Faith, or its well-being must be closely obeyed, as he is infallible in the protection of the Faith. He is assured the guidance of both Bahá'u'lláh and the Bab, as the Will and Testament of 'Abdu'l-Bahá clearly reveals."

Now, in the matter of the accuracy of historical fact, Shoghi Effendi had to rely on available information. For example, on page 5 of GOD PASSES BY, he refers to Haji Mirza Aqasi as ". . . the idolized tutor of Muhammad Shah, a vulgar, false-hearted and fickleminded schemer . . ." An appropriate and pertinent quotation supporting that characterization can be found in P. M. Sykes's A HISTORY OF PERSIA, Volume 2, pages 439-440, which appears as a footnote on page 233 of NABIL'S NARRATIVE:

> "The state of Persia, however, was not satisfactory; for Haji Mirza Aqasi, who had been its virtual ruler for thir- teen years, 'was utterly ignorant of statesmanship or of military science, yet too vain to receive instruction and too jealous to admit of a coadjutor; brutal in his language; insolent in his demeanour; indolent in his habits; he brought the exchequer to the verge of bankruptcy and the country to the brink of revolution . . ." Such—to adopt the weighty words of Rawlinson—was the condition of Persia in the middle of the nineteenth century."

The Guardian was meticulous about the authenticity of historical fact. One of the friends in Yazd wrote to him stating that the account given by 'Abdu'l-Bahá in one of His Tablets about events related to the martyrdom of some of the believers in that place sas in conflict with known facts about these events. Shoghi Effendi replied saying that the friends should investigate the facts carefully and unhesitatingly register them in their historical records, since 'Abdu'l-Bahá Himself had prefaced His recording of the events in His Tablet with a statement that it was based on news received from Yazd.

It is a great pity if some of the friends fail to recognize the matchless prose to be found in the Guardian's writings. Shoghi Effendi's masterly use of the English language makes the meaning abundantly clear, and that is an essential quality of great works.

Infallibility of the Guar dian of the Bahá’í Faith

Univ ersal House o f Justice letter to one o f t h e be li e v ers

25 July, 1974
Dear Bahá’í friend,

We have received your letter stating you were disturbed by
statements made in your deepening class regarding the infallibility of
the beloved Guardian, and we appreciate your concern.

According to your letter, this question arose in connection with
Shoghi Effendi’s references in “God Passes By” to historical events,
and his descriptions of the characters of opponents of the faith,
particularly that of Óájí Mírzá Áqásí. Letters written on behalf of
the guardian by his secretary to individuals who asked similar
questions clearly define the sphere of the Guardian’s infallibility. We
quote from two of these, one written in 1944, the second in 1956.

> The infallibility of the Guardian is confined to matters which
> are related strictly to the Cause and interpretations of the
> Teachings; he is not an infallible authority on other subjects,
> such as economics, science, etc.
> The Guardian’s infallibility covers interpretation of the revealed
> word, and its application. Likewise, any instructions he may
> issue having to do with the protection of the Faith, or its well-
> being must be closely obeyed, as he is infallible in the
> protection of the Faith. He is assured the guidance of both
> Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb, as the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá clearly reveals.

Now, in the matter of accuracy of historical fact, Shoghi Effendi
had to rely on available information. For example, on page 5 of “God
passes By”, he refers to Óájí Mírzá Áqásí as “... the idolized tutor of
Mu˙ammad Sháh, a vulgar, false-hearted and fickle-minded
schemer...” An appropriate and pertinent quotation supporting that
characterization can be found in P. M. Sykes’s “A History of Persia”,
Volume 2, pages 439-440, which appears as a footnote on page 233
of “Nabíl’s Narrative”:

> The state of Persia, however, was not satisfactory; for Óájí
> Mírzá Áqásí, who had been its virtual ruler for thirteen years,
> ‘was utterly ignorant of statesmanship or of military science, yet
too vain to receive instruction and too jealous to admit of a

> coadjutor; brutal in his language; insolent in his demeanour;
> indolent in his habits; he brought the exchequer to the verge of
> bankruptcy and the country to the brink of revolution ...’ Such
> — to adopt the weighty words of Rawlinson — was the
> condition of Persia in the middle of the nineteenth century.

The Guardian was very meticulous about the authenticity of
historical fact. One of the friends in Yazd wrote to him stating that
the account given by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in one of His tablets about events
related to the martyrdom of some of the believers in that place was in
conflict with known facts about these events. Shoghi Effendi replied
saying that the friends should investigate the facts carefully and
unhesitatingly register them in their historical records, since ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá Himself had prefaced His recording of the events in His Tablet
with a statement that it was based on news received from Yazd.

It is a great pity if some of the friends fail to recognize the
matchless prose to be found in the Guardian’s writings. Shoghi
Effendi’s masterly use of the English language makes the meaning
abundantly clear, and that is an essential quality of great works.

We are delighted that you and your dear wife are conducting
classes for the benefit of the friends, and we will remember you both
in our prayers at the Holy Threshold.
With loving Bahá’í greetings,
The Universal House of Justice

The quotation from Abu’l-Fazl Gulpáygání, taken from Miracles
and Metaphors, pp. 9-10 reads as follows:

> It is clear that the prophets and Manifestations of the Cause of
> God were sent to guide the nations, to improve their characters,
> and bring people nearer their Source and ultimate Goal. They were
> not sent as historians, astronomers, philosophers or natural
> scientists. Their position in the world of creation is like that of the
> heart in the body: it has a universal position with a general effect.
> The position of the learned in the world of earthly dominion is like
> that of a specific organ. That is, they have a particular position
> and a special effect. Therefore, the prophets have indulged the
> people in regard to their historical notions, folk stories, and
> scientific principles, and have spoken to them according to
> these.... But from the point of view of science, it is impermissible
> for the historian to depend on the literal meaning of these verses.
> This is because he cannot discount the very real possibility that
> they possess a higher significance and are subject to sublime,
> figurative interpretations which differ from the understanding
> that might be gained from their external sense.
