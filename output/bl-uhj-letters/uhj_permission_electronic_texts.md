Mr. ....  
  
Dear Bahá'í Friend,  
  
Your email message of 15 April 2000 requesting permission to include electronic versions of _The Proclamation of Bahá'u'lláh_ and _Bahiyyih Khanum_ in \[your\] electronic textbase of the Bahá'í Writings ... has been received at the Bahá'í World Centre.  
  
There is no objection to your using electronic versions of these texts as you have indicated. For your information, there are no copyright restrictions on publishing the Sacred Text, the works of the Guardian, books produced by World Centre Publications or the Bahá'í International Community. Permission from independent Bahá'í publishers is required before publishing books produced by them. It is also common practice to include an acknowledgement of copyright and to indicate the original source for electronic text.

With loving Bahá'í greetings,  
Department of the Secretariat
