### by / on behalf of [Bahá'í World Centre](https://bahai-library.com/author/Bahá'í+World+Centre)

1998/2008


3 February 1998  
  
Dear Bahá’í Friend,  
  
Your email of 8 January 1998, requesting updated information about the percentage of National Spiritual Assembly members who are women, has been received at the Bahá’í World Centre.  
  
Please find enclosed a table showing historical information, similar to the one previously sent to you, but updated to 1997. Also enclosed is our letter to you of 12 June 1996 \[not included here\].

With loving Bahá’í greetings,  
For the Department of Statistics

  

\[**Note:** the table below lists 1992 twice; the second one is presumably a typo for '1993.'\]
