Transmitted by email:

Dear Baha'i Friend,

Your email letters of 13, 18 and 23May 2007 have been received by the Universal House
of Justice, which has asked us to respond as follows.

The pressure of work at the Baha'iWorld Centre does not permit it to continue to provide
a detailed response to your questions. You are advised to tum to your Spiritual Assembly or a
knowledgeable believer in your area for assistance in this regard.

Responses to several of your questions are set out in the enclosed memorandum prepared
by the Research Department. Concerning questions 1, 3,                   � and 7 in your     13May 2007 letter,
we have been asked to provide the following information. The passage on childhood was

·

mistakenly attributed to 'Abdu'l-Baha; it was authored by the Hand of the Cause of God George
Townshend and published in his book           The Mission ofBaha 'u 'llah and other literary pieces
(Oxford: George Ronald, 1952, 1976 printing). TheWorld Centre does not have an authentic
photograph or drawing ofMulla I:Iusayn. No complete list of sites for future Baha'i Houses of
Worship has been published. No additional information is available about the passages quoted
from the "Mathnavi" of Rumi.

With loving Baha'i greetings,

Department of the Secretariat

MEMORANDUM

To:     The Universal House of Justice                             Date: 6 August 2007

From:   Research Department

Prayer of the Bab, Jungle Story, Statement Concerning

Persepolis, Psychic Powers

At the instruction of the Universal House of Justice, the Research Department has studied
the questions on the above-mentioned subjects posed byMr..                    , in his email letters
of 13, 18 and 23May 2007 received at the Baha'iWorld Centre. We provide the following
response.

Prayer of the Bab

Mr. �         refers to Velda PiffMetelmann's book entitled Lua    Getsinger, Herald of the
Covenant (Oxford: George Ronald, 1997). He indicates that in this book, it is stated that "Lua
used to say a certain prayer that the Bah had given to Tahirih." Mr.            wishes to know
which particular prayer Lua used. From a preliminary perusal ofMrs.Metelmann's book, the
Research Department has located several brief references to Tahirih on pages 55 and 56, page
189, and pages 277 and 278, none, however, relate specifically to Lua's recitation of a prayer by
the Bah. IfMr.             could provide the precise page reference, it might be possible for the
Department to undertake an additional search.

Story about a person in a jungle

With regard to the enquiry about "a story about someone trying to get out of a jungle,
but repeatedly being put back by a hand to the middle of the jungle, unable to reach the city",
the Research Department has found no information about this subject in the authoritative
Writings of the Faith.

Statement concerning Persepolis

Mr.           refers to a statement of 'Abdu'l-Baha which indicates that "Persepolis
would be rebuilt in the future as a Baha'i House ofWorship". He enquires about its source and
whether it might possibly be a pilgrim's note. A statement concerning Persepolis as a future site
of a House ofWorship is found in a talk delivered by 'Abdu'l-Baha on 18 July 19 15. The talk,
which deals generally with Iranian civilization prior to Islam and the prospect of its resurgence,
has not, to date, been translated into English. It is published in the original language in Abdu'l­
I:Iamid Ishraq Khavari's   Ra/:liq-i-Makhtum (Tihran: Baha'i Publishing Trust, 13 1 B.E.), volume
2, pages 499-503.
Prayer of the Bab. Jungle Story, Statement                                               6 August2007

Concerning Persepolis, Psychic Powers                                                          Page2

Psychic Powers

Mr. :           cites the following extract from a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi
which appears as section 1735 in    Lights of Guidance: A Baha'i Reference File:

What 'Abdu'l-Baha always pointed out in this matter is that these psychic
> powers were not to be used in this world, and that, indeed, it was dangerous to
> cultivate them here. They should be left dormant, and not exploited, even when we
> do so with the sincere belief we are helping others. We do not understand their
> nature and have no way of being sure of what is true and what is false in such
> matters.

Mr.             provides a long list of subjects, categorized in an encyclopedia as "psychic
powers" and seeks clarification concerning whether, from a Baha'i perspective, these subjects
might also be regarded as "psychic powers". In addition, he enquires about the Baha'i view of
such practices as "Reiki, aura reading, developing chakra's,      [sic.] healing with hands etc."

As to what constitutes "psychic powers", the Universal House of Justice, in a letter dated
13 June 1982 written on its behalf to a National Spiritual Assembly, provided the following
guidance in response to an earlier question on this subject:

The Universal House of Justice does not wish to go into the various
> definitions and distinctions that you list under the heading "Psychic Powers,
> Spiritualism etc." It is clear that what 'Abdu'l-Baha and Shoghi Effendi had in
> mind when warning the believers against meddling with psychic forces were
> those that spiritualists believe come from a deliberate effort on the part of
> individuals to establish communication with the departed.

GivenMr."            ;'s interest in this subject, he might find it useful to refer to chapter
XLII, entitled "Psychic Phenomena" in Lights       of Guidance: A Baha'i Reference File. This
chapter contains extracts from the authoritativeWritings of the Faith, which will, no doubt,
help to further his understanding of this topic.

With regard to the Baha'i view of reiki, aura reading, and developing chakras, the
Research Department was not able to locate any information concerning these practises in the
authoritative Baha'iWritings. ForMr.-              's information, we provide the following extract
from a letter dated 17 August 2004, written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an
individual believer who enquired about the appropriateness of studying various approaches to
natural therapy:

> As you may know, no specific school of medicine is endorsed in the Baha'i
> Teachings. You should, therefore, weigh the various possibilities open to you in the
> light of the general teachings found in theWritings and reach your own conclusions
> about their acceptability.

Finally, in relation to the Baha'i perspective on "healing with hands" in the following
statement taken from a letter dated 8 June 1948 written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi, certain
broad principles are set out to guide a believer who had enquired about the acceptability of a
kind of healing which involved the channelling of healing power through the healer's hands.
The letter states:
Prayer of the Bah. Jungle Story, Statement                                           6 August2007

Concerning Persepolis, Psychic Powers                                                        Page3

The Guardian knows nothing about your kind of healing, nor would he care
> to go into the question in detail, as he has no time for such matters. But he can lay
> down for your guidance certain broad principles: there is no such thing as Baha'i
> healers or a Baha'i type of healing. In His Most Holy Book (the Aqdas) Baha'u'llah
> says to consult the best physicians, in other words doctors who have studied a
> scientific system of medicine; He never gave us to believe He Himself would heal
> us through "healers", but rather through prayer and the assistance of medicine and
> approved treatments.

Now, as long as your healing is in no opposition to these principles, as long as
> you do not try and take the place of a regular doctor in trying to heal others, but only
> give them your kind of help through constructive suggestion-or whatever it may
> be-and do not associate this help with being a channel of the direct grace of
> Baha'u'llah, the Guardian sees no harm in your continuing your assistance to others.
> But you must conscientiously decide whether, in view of the above, you are really
> justified in continuing.

In addition, Mr.   _      may wish to peruse Chapter 72 of    Some Answered Questions.
