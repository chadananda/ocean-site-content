## Women Serving as Continental Counselors or in the International Teaching Centre, Percentage of: 1980-2010

23 January 2013  
Dear ...

Your email message of 16 August 2010, requesting information about the percentage of members of the Continental Boards of Counsellors and the International Teaching Centre who are women, has been received at the Bahá’í World Centre and referred to our Department for response. We deeply regret that your letter was inadvertently set aside and is only now receiving a reply.

We are pleased to enclose a document with a table providing historical data from 1980 for the membership of the Continental Boards of Counsellors. As for the International Teaching Centre, from 1988, when the Universal House of Justice increased the number of Counsellors appointed to that body to nine, until 2000, it functioned with four Counsellor members who were women, and from 2000 to the present, five of its members have been women. It is hoped that this information is useful.

With loving Bahá’í greetings, Department of Statistics

as members of the Continental Boards of Counsellors for the period from 26 November
1980—when the number of Boards was fixed at five—until now, including the most recent

the basis of the appointments made at the beginning of each five-year term; mid-term
