Dear Bahá'í Friend,  
  
The Universal House of Justice has received your email of 5 January 1999 seeking clarification on the recitation of the Prayer for the Dead,and we have been asked to provide you with the following guidance.  
  
The correct way of reciting the Prayer for the Dead is as follows:

Allah-u-Abha (once)  
We all, verily, worship God (19 times)  
  
Allah-u-Abha (once)  
We all, verily, bow down before God (19 times)  
  
Allah-u-Abha (once)  
We all, verily, are devoted unto God (19 times)  
  
Allah-u-Abha (once)  
We all, verily, give praise unto God (19 times)  
  
Allah-u-Abha (once)  
We all, verily yield thanks unto God (19 times)  
  
Allah-u-Abha (once)  
We all, verily, are patient in God (19 times)

The passages should be repeated by one person. In carrying out the requirements for the prayer, one person reads or recites the passages from memory while the congregation stands. It is not the practice for those present to repeat any part of the prayer in unison.

With loving Bahá'í greetings,
