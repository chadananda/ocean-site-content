## "The Book of Names" Mentioned in the Tablet of Carmel

### The “Book of Names” Mentioned in the Tablet of Carmel

In an email message of 4 February 2003 addressed to the Bahá’í World Centre, ... enquires about the “Book of Names” mentioned in the following passage from the Tablet of Carmel:

> Ere long will God sail His Ark upon thee, and will manifest the people of Bahá who have been mentioned in the Book of Names.1

... indicates that while he is familiar with Shoghi Effendi’s interpretation of this prophetic statement, contained in “Messages to America”, pages 32–33,2 he has been unable to discover exactly what the term “Book of Names” refers to. He enquires whether it might constitute a reference to the Kitáb-i-Asmá’ revealed by the Báb or to some other book or, indeed, whether it is “a philosophical-theological type of reference”. We provide the following response.

In relation to the passage cited above, the Research Department has located a number of references in the literature of the Faith that shed light on the significance of the “Ark” and that identify the “people of Bahá who have been mentioned in the Book of Names” with the Universal House of Justice. These references are assembled in a short compilation entitled “The People of Bahá Mentioned in the Book of Names”, which we attach for ...’s information.

The Research Department has not, however, been able to locate any authoritative interpretation of the specific term “Book of Names”. Although the term is capitalized in the English translation, we have, to date, not been able to find any statement in the Bahá’í Writings to suggest that it constitutes a reference to a particular book. It is suggested, therefore, that the “Book of Names” might well refer to the all-encompassing knowledge of God.

                    The People of Bahá Mentioned in the Book of Names

Selected Extracts

Extract from the Tablet of Carmel

“Call out to Zion, O Carmel, and announce the joyful tidings: He that was hidden
from mortal eyes is come! His all-conquering sovereignty is manifest; His all-encompassing
splendour is revealed. Beware lest thou hesitate or halt. Hasten forth and circumambulate the
City of God that hath descended from heaven, the celestial Kaaba round which have circled in
adoration the favoured of God, the pure in heart, and the company of the most exalted angels.
Oh, how I long to announce unto every spot on the surface of the earth, and to carry to each one
of its cities, the glad-tidings of this Revelation—a Revelation to which the heart of Sinai hath
been attracted, and in whose name the Burning Bush is calling: ‘Unto God, the Lord of Lords,
belong the kingdoms of earth and heaven.’ Verily this is the Day in which both land and sea
rejoice at this announcement, the Day for which have been laid up those things which God,
through a bounty beyond the ken of mortal mind or heart, hath destined for revelation. Ere
long will God sail His Ark upon thee, and will manifest the people of Bahá who have been
mentioned in the Book of Names.”
(“Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh Revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas” (Wilmette: Bahá’í

Publishing Trust, 1998), pages 4–5)                                             [1]

Extracts from Letters Written by Shoghi Effendi

Then will the Throne of Bahá’u’lláh’s sovereignty be founded in the promised land and the scales
of justice be raised on high. Then will the banner of the independence of the Faith be unfurled,
and His Most Great Law be unveiled and rivers of laws and ordinances stream forth from this
snow-white spot with all-conquering power and awe-inspiring majesty, the like of which past
ages have never seen. Then will appear the truth of what was revealed by the Tongue of
Grandeur: “Call out to Zion, O Carmel, and announce the joyful tidings: He that was hidden
from mortal eyes is come! His all-conquering sovereignty is manifest; His all-encompassing
splendour is revealed.” “...O Carmel... Well is it with him that circleth around thee, that
proclaimeth the revelation of thy glory, and recounteth that which the bounty of the Lord, thy
God, hath showered upon thee.… Ere long will God sail His Ark upon thee, and will manifest
thepeople of Bahá who have been mentioned in the Book of Names.”...

Through it the pillars of the Faith on this earth will be firmly established and its hidden powers be
revealed, its signs shine forth, its banners be unfurled and its light be shed upon all peoples.

(27 November 1929, translated from the Persian)                                     [2]

For it must be clearly understood, nor can it be sufficiently emphasized, that the
conjunction of the resting-place of the Greatest Holy Leaf with those of her brother and mother
incalculably reinforces the spiritual potencies of that consecrated Spot which, under the wings
of the Báb’s overshadowing Sepulchre, and in the vicinity of the future Mashriqu’l-Adhkár which
will be reared on its flank, is destined to evolve into the focal centre of those world-shaking,
world-embracing, world-directing administrative institutions, ordained by Bahá’u’lláh and
anticipated by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and which are to function in consonance with the principles that
govern the twin institutions of the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice. Then, and
then only, will this momentous prophecy which illuminates the concluding passages of the Tablet

of Carmel be fulfilled: “Ere long will God sail His Ark upon thee (Carmel), and will manifest the
people of Bahá who have been mentioned in the Book of Names.”
(“Messages to America: Selected Letters and Cablegrams Addressed to the

> Bahá’ís of North America, 1932–1946” (Wilmette: Bahá’í Publishing
> Committee, 1947), pages 32–33)                                                   [3]

The construction of the Mausoleum of the Báb, synchronizing with the birth of that State,
and the progress of which has been accompanied by these successive manifestations of the
goodwill and support of the civil authorities, will, if steadily maintained, greatly reinforce, and
lend a tremendous impetus to, this process of recognition which constitutes a historic landmark in
the evolution of the world centre of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh—a process which the newly formed
Council, now established at its very heart, is designed to foster, which will gather momentum,
with the emergence, in the course of time, of a properly recognized and independently
functioning Bahá’í court, which will attain its consummation in the institution of the Universal
House of Justice and the emergence of the auxiliary administrative Agencies, revolving around
this Highest Legislative Body, and which will reveal the plenitude of its potentialities with the
sailing of the Divine Ark as promised in the Tablet of Carmel.
(“Citadel of Faith: Messages to America 1947–1957” (Wilmette: Bahá’í

Publishing Trust, 1995), pages 94–95)                                                [4]

This stately edifice1 will in turn herald the establishment of the exalted World
Administrative Centre of the Faith on this Holy Mountain and will signalize at once the sailing
of the Ark of God and the fulfilment of the momentous glad-tidings to which the glorious Pen
of Bahá’u’lláh has made an allusion more eloquent than any explicit utterance. Exalted and
glorified be His Words: “Verily this is the Day in which both land and sea rejoice at this
announcement, the Day for which have been laid up those things which God, through a bounty
beyond the ken of mortal mind or heart, hath destined for revelation. Ere long will God sail His
Ark upon thee, and will manifest the people of Bahá who have been mentioned in the Book of
Names....” There is no doubt whatever that what is meant by “Ark” at the end of this Tablet, is
the Ark of Laws and not that of the Cause of God, whose Mariner is the supreme Lawgiver, the
Most Glorious Abhá Beauty, and whose dwellers are the entire Bahá’í community, the
companions of the Crimson Ark.

(Naw-Rúz 1954, translated from the Persian)                                        [5]

In this great Tablet which unveils divine mysteries and heralds the establishment of
two mighty, majestic and momentous undertakings—one of which is spiritual and the other
administrative, both at the World Centre of the Faith—Bahá’u’lláh refers to an “Ark”, whose
dwellers are the men of the Supreme House of Justice, which, in conformity with the exact
provisions of the Will and Testament of the Centre of the Mighty Covenant, is the body which
should lay down laws not explicitly revealed in the Text. In this Dispensation, these laws are
destined to flow from this Holy Mountain, even as in the Mosaic Dispensation the law of God
was promulgated from Zion. The “sailing of the Ark” of His laws is a reference to the
establishment of the Universal House of Justice, which is indeed the Seat of Legislation, one
of the branches of the World Administrative Centre of the Bahá’ís on this Holy Mountain. It
will be housed in a separate building near the International Archives Building, now under
construction, on a site in the neighbourhood of the Shrine of the Báb, and overlooking the sacred
and illumined Monuments.

\[1\] The International Archives Building

In the neighbourhood of these two stately edifices and two mighty institutions,2 another
edifice will gradually be erected which will be the Seat of the Guardianship, the Centre which
will interpret, expound and prepare commentaries on the explicitly revealed laws, and will
reinforce and supplement the legislative body. Yet another edifice to supplement these three
edifices will be the Centre for the propagation and teaching of the Faith, the Seat for the Hands
of the Cause, who, in accordance with the explicit text of the Will and Testament, are charged
with the security, the preservation and protection of the Cause, the safeguarding of the unity of
the community, the promotion of God’s religion and the spread of His Word.

These majestic and mighty edifices, which will be constructed gradually in accordance with
a beautiful and unique style of architecture around the sacred Monuments, are all considered as
branches of this highly exalted, firmly grounded and broadly based World Administrative Centre
of the followers of the Cause of Him Who is the Lord of this Age and the Ruler of Creation.

(Naw-Rúz 1954, translated from the Persian)                                       [6]

From the Writings and Letters of the Universal House of Justice

The members of the Universal House of Justice, designated by Bahá’u’lláh “the Men of
Justice”, “the people of Bahá who have been mentioned in the Book of Names”, “the Trustees
of God amongst His servants and the daysprings of authority in His countries”, shall in the
discharge of their responsibilities ever bear in mind the following standards set forth by Shoghi
Effendi, the Guardian of the Cause of God…
(“The Constitution of the Universal House of Justice” (Haifa: Bahá’í World

Centre, 1972), page 6)                                                           [7]

While there are many references in the Writings to the “Ark of the Cause”, these refer to the
entire Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, Who writes of His followers as “the dwellers in the Crimson Ark”.
A more restricted meaning appears in the Tablet of Carmel:3

“Ere long will God sail His Ark upon thee, and will manifest the people of
Bahá who have been mentioned in the Book of Names.”

This passage is referred to by Shoghi Effendi, who identifies it as the Ark of God’s Laws,
whose occupants are the members of the Universal House of Justice. In other words this
passage is an allusion to the establishment of the Universal House of Justice on Mount Carmel.
(From a letter dated 13 December 1994, written on behalf of the Universal

House of Justice to a National Spiritual Assembly)                             [8]
