The Research Department has considered the questions
contained in the email message of 15 January 2004 from … to
the Universal House of Justice. As a context for his queries, …
appends a number of extracts from Web sites and email
communications he has had with several individuals. … appears
to be particularly interested in “the nature of the designation
of Azal” and to this end seeks information about the
authenticity of the Law˙-i-Vaßaya, which he understands is
regarded by the Azal’s as the basis for Mírzá Ya˙yá’s titles and
position. He also enquires about the meaning of a particular
verse in the Persian Bayán. We provide the following response.
Tablet of the Báb

The Tablet of the Báb, which is described as “The Báb’s
Law˙-i-Vasaya: The Will and Testament” on the Web site
www.h-net.org/bahai/areprint/Báb/S-Z/vasaya/vasaya.htm,

388                                       Elucidations: Mírzá Yahyá

referred to by …, can be found on pages 95—102 in volume 64,
published in the Iran National Bahá’í Archives (INBA) series.
This volume was published in B.E. 133 and contains various
Writings of the Báb. We attach for … information a
photocopy of the Tablet from that volume. It is important to
call attention to the fact that, while in some quarters this
Tablet has become known as the Will and Testament of the Báb,
the Research Department has, to date, found no explicit
evidence to suggest that the Báb, Himself, designated the Tablet
as such. Indeed, from a perusal of the attached material, … will
see that the Tablet bears no title. He will also see that, while the
Tablet is addressed to Azal, there is nothing in its contents
pertaining to questions of successorship and authority.
Rather, the recipient is enjoined to promote and protect the
Faith and to invite people to follow what has been revealed in
the Bayán. To date, no authorized English translation of the
Tablet is available.

As to the circumstances of Mírzá Ya˙yá’s nomination, it is
interesting to note that in the Bábí Dispensation, the Lesser
Covenant, that Covenant made by the Manifestation of God
with His followers to accept His appointed successor, is,
according to the Guardian, found interspersed in the Báb’s
Book of Laws, the Persian Bayán, in many passages, some of
which were “designedly obscure,” but mostly “indubitably clear
and conclusive.”1 The Báb seems to have alerted His followers
to the promised advent of Bahá’u’lláh, instead of designating
an appointed successor. Indeed, the Guardian stated:

> A successor or vicegerent the Báb never named, an
> interpreter of His teachings He refrained from
> appointing. So transparently clear were His references
> to the Promised One, so brief was to be the duration of
> His own Dispensation, that neither the one nor the
> other was deemed necessary. All He did was, according
> to the testimony of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in “A Traveller’s
> Narrative,” to nominate, on the advice of Bahá’u’lláh
> and of another disciple, Mírzá Ya˙yá, who would act
> solely as a figure-head pending the manifestation of the
> Promised One, thus enabling Bahá’u’lláh to promote,
> in relative security, the Cause so dear to His heart.

(“God Passes By,” pp. 28—29)

The following extract from a letter dated 4 August 1980,
written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an
individual believer, deals with the position of Mírzá Ya˙yá in
the Bábí community:

> Concerning the position of Mírzá Ya˙yá in the Bábí
> community, the Guardian has made it quite clear in
> “God Passes By” that Mírzá Ya˙yá was the Báb’s
> “nominee” and was the “recognized chief of the Bábí
> community” following the martyrdom of the Báb. He
> has also referred to him as “titular head” and “a mere
> figurehead” (see “God Passes By” page 90). The position
> occupied by Mírzá Ya˙yá was far different from being
> an appointed Successor of a Manifestation of God in
> the sense that St. Peter, the Imám ‘Alí or ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
> were appointed Successors with far-reaching authority.
> Obviously the Báb had no need to appoint such a
> Successor, for He knew that Bahá’u’lláh was already
> present and ready to be revealed at the appointed time.
> He seems, therefore, merely to have nominated a titular
> head for the Bábí community as a focal point of unity
> until such time as He Whom God will make manifest
> would decide to unveil Himself.

Additional details concerning the circumstances of Mírzá
Ya˙yá’s nomination are contained in
•    ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “A Traveller’s Narrative” (Wilmette:

Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1980), pp. 37—38;
•    Adib Taherzadeh, “The Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh,”

volume I (Oxford: George Ronald, 1974), pp. 53—54;
•    Adib Taherzadeh, “The Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh,”

> volume II (Oxford: George Ronald, 1977), pp. 241—242

and 247.

Titles of Azal

As to whether Mírzá Ya˙yá’s titles were derived from Tablets
of the Báb or fabricated by Azal and his followers, in his book,
“Mustayqi,” Mírzá Ya˙yá attributes a number of divine names
and attributes to himself, one of which is “Azal.”2

390                                           Elucidations: Mírzá Yahyá

The title “Íub˙-i-Azal” appears in an Islamic tradition which
is called Óadíth-i-Kumayl (Kumayl was a devoted student of the
first Imám, ‘Alí 3), and a portion of the Óadíth is quoted by the
Báb in “Dalá’il-i-Sab’ih” (Bábíyyih Publication, p. 58). Mírzá Ya˙yá
and his followers erroneously have taken this term as a reference
to Mírzá Ya˙yá.

In the book “Making the Crooked Straight: A Contribution
to Bahá’í Apologetics,” 4 the following footnote provides
additional information about the origin of Mírzá Ya˙yá’s
attributing to himself the title “Íub˙-i-Azal.”

> Mírzá Ya˙yá Azal was evidently known also by the
> name Íub˙-i-Azal. This is, at least, the title used by
> Browne, and it is probably through his works that this
> title was first made public. In Azalí works (such as
> “Hasht Bihisht”) and works written under Azalí
> influence (such as the “Kitáb-i-Nuq†atu’l-Káf” or
> Gobineau’s “Les Religions”) Mírzá Ya˙yá is referred to
> by the title “Óa∂rat-i-Azal,” not “Íub˙i-Azal.” The
> origin or first use of the title Íub˙-i-Azal has not yet
> been identified. This title of honour was evidently not
> conferred on him by the Báb, who only called him
> “Thamaratu’l-Azalíyya” and “‘Ismu’l-Azal” (see Mírzá
> Ya˙yá, “Mustayqi,” pp. 391f.). However, the Báb did
> employ the title Íub˙-i-Azal in reference to various
> other leading Báb’s (see the commentary on the Óadíth of
> Kumayl, Teheran Bahá’í Archives MS 6006 C., pp. 74ff.), so that
> it is quite possible that Mírzá Ya˙yá was occasionally
> thus designated.

Persian Bayán, passage 2:16

… requests assistance in understanding a passage from the
Persian Bayán, 2:16, which, among other things, refers to the
Mustagháth and the timing of the advent of the Promised One.
Although … specific question is not clearly stated, it would
appear that he is unsure how the meaning of the verse in the
Bayán is to be understood in light of a statement in H. M.
Balyuzi’s “E. G. Browne and the Bahá’í Faith” concerning the
Azalí view of the coming of the Promised One.

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Eight                                          391

The Research Department has not, to date, been able to
locate an authoritative interpretation of the particular passage
from the Persian Bayán in the Writings. However, we attach
for … information a discussion of the prophesy in the Writings
of the Báb concerning the advent of the Promised One that is
published in “Making the Crooked Straight: A Contribution to
Bahá’í Apologetics.”5 This discussion may well assist … in
furthering his understanding of some of the themes in the
passage in question.
