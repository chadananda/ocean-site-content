Development of Bahá’í Scholarly Activities

The Universal House of Justice

24 April 2008
Dear Bahá’í Friends,

Your email letter dated … has been received by the Universal
House of Justice, which has asked us to respond as follows.

The House of Justice is fully committed to fostering the
development of Bahá’í scholarly activity in all parts of the
Bahá’í world. Through their scholarly endeavours believers are
able to enrich the intellectual life of the Bahá’í community, to
explore new insights into the Bahá’í teachings and their
relevance to the needs of society, and to attract the
investigation of the Faith by thoughtful people from all
backgrounds. Far from being a diversion from the worldwide
effort to advance the process of entry by troops, Bahá’í
scholarship can be a powerful reinforcement to that endeavour
and a valuable source of new enquirers.

The hope of the House of Justice is that, as the Bahá’í
community develops in each country, the concerned National
Spiritual Assembly will encourage those so inclined to embark
on Bahá’í scholarly activities. When the number of believers
involved reaches a sufficient size, an Association for Bahá’í
Studies may well come into being and act as a focus for
support and encouragement; in due course, such an
association may be moved to launch, under the aegis of its
National Spiritual Assembly, a journal by which the findings of
those engaged in this pursuit can be shared with others. Such
associations are generally formed at a national level, although
the situation in Europe is such that transnational associations
have, at this time, been permitted within that continent. In
time the House of Justice will give consideration to whether or
not the objectives of the Faith would best be served by the
formation of some international organization to coordinate

the work of the associations and to stimulate the creation of
new ones in other countries and whether an international
journal should be brought into being.

When there are relatively few believers engaged in Bahá’í
scholarly activity in a country, the formation of an
association there is not viable. However, believers from any
part of the world are free to submit papers to Bahá’í journals
being published in other countries or to seek to make
presentations at meetings arranged by the existing associations
elsewhere.

…The individuals having an interest in Bahá’í scholarship are,
of course, free to pursue their own scholarly endeavours and to
submit their conclusions to existing journals in Europe, North
America or elsewhere. They should also be advised to consider
means by which they can participate in the work of existing
associations.

> With loving Bahá’í greetings,
> Department of the Secretariat
