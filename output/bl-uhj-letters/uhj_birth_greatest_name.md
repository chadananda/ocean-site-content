## Tablet on the Birth of the Greatest Name II

Dear Bahá’í Friend,  
  
The Universal House of Justice has received your email letter of 5 April 2004 on behalf of the magazine _Bahá’í Vizier_ regarding the "Tablet on the Birth of the Greatest Name II" published on the Internet \[online [here](http://bahai-library.com/bahaullah_lawh_imawlud_ism-azam)\], and it has asked our Department to respond as follows.  
  
This Tablet is one of the several Tablets revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in commemoration of His birthday. The title as published on the Internet was given to it by the translator, and as there were several Tablets revealed for this occasion, it is not known which Tablet may have been designated as the first.  
  
The Bahá’í World Centre has no information about the circumstances surrounding the revelation of these Tablets, and no authorized translations are available. However, they are being considered in connection with a new volume of translations. The House of Justice therefore suggests that plans for a Dutch translation be delayed until the authorized translations are published.

With loving Bahá’í greetings,  
Department of the Secretariat
