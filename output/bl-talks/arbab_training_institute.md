International Bahá’í Conference 2004

Sydney – Perth, Australia
Notes from a Series of Talks by Dr. Farzam Arbab

Day 2
The Training Institute and Its Main Sequence of Courses

Yesterday we talked about education and capacity building. In this context, we reminded
ourselves that the Bahá’í world community is engaged in a historical enterprise of
unimaginable magnitude, an enterprise that seeks a most profound transformation at the
level of both the individual and society. The Divine Plan, which governs our efforts to
promote this dual transformation, proceeds in successive stages, and at any given
moment, our collective educational endeavors as a Bahá’í community need to respond to
the exigencies of the Plan at that moment. The concept of the training institute could be
understood in this context: as an instrument to set in motion a certain educational process
at this particular stage of the unfoldment of the Divine Plan. Today, I am to share with
you a few ideas about the nature and purpose of the training institute and its main
sequence of courses, hoping that you will find these remarks useful in your reflections.

We mentioned yesterday that the first act of systemization called for by the Four Year
Plan was in relation to the development of human resources. The 26 December 1995
message of the Universal House of Justice to the Conference of the Continental Boards of
Counsellors, made the following statement:

The development of human resources on a large scale requires that the
> establishment of institutes be viewed in a new light. In many regions, it has become
> imperative to create institutes as organizational structures dedicated to systematic
> training. The purpose of such training is to endow ever-growing contingents of
> believers with the spiritual insights, the knowledge, and the skills needed to carry out
> the many tasks of accelerated expansion and consolidation, including the teaching and
> deepening of a large number of people—adults, youth and children. This purpose can
> best be achieved through well-organized, formal programs consisting of courses that
> follow appropriately designed curricula.

Many questions have arisen about the nature of the institute process and its relationship to
other activities, as the friends have striven to implement this guidance of the Universal
House of Justice. There are those who have wondered, for example, whether
participation in institute courses is mandatory or whether deepening classes are no longer
necessary. Some have asked whether firesides are being replaced by study circles, while
others have expressed unease at what they see as a danger of uniformity. All such
questions and concerns are laid to rest when we remember what a training institute is: It
is an agency for the development of human resources dedicated to the advancement of the
process of entry by troops. In this sense, it is to set in motion an educational process that
is intended to respond to a very specific exigency of the Divine Plan. It does not compete
with or act as a substitute for the other structures that have been built over the decades.

It is important to note that the Four Year Plan was actually couched in terms of the
building of institutional capacity in each national community for training large numbers.
Since, as I mentioned yesterday, the Bahá’í world’s previous experience with large-scale
expansion had not been sustained, we can safely assume that this capacity was not well
developed in any country, at least not certainly to the extent that this new stage of
systematization demanded. Counsellors and National Assemblies, then, were obliged to
embark on a period of accelerated learning to discover the appropriate materials, methods
and modes of delivery of the educational process being established. Many alternatives
were tried throughout the world, but experiences did converge, in ways that could not
have been anticipated, and after a few years a system had evolved around the materials
developed by the Ruhi Institute in Colombia, and were being employed by national
community after national community.

The fundamental ideas upon which the system is built—the sequence of books, the trunk
and the branches, tutors, study circles, tutor reflection meetings, institute campaigns—
with all of these you are familiar. Your own country adopted the system towards the end
of 1997 and has played a part in the worldwide development of the concept of a training
institute as a most crucial agency of the Faith. That the initial set of materials around
which the system took shape emerged from a country somewhat more advanced than its
sister communities in the systematization required by the Four Year Plan seems
reasonable. But, in the final analysis, the specific country of origin is of little
consequence. What we are doing today, then, is examining the main sequence of the
courses of your training institutes and your experience with it. Tomorrow, we will look
at the question of branch courses and the development of curricula for them.

Before entering into specifics about the main sequence, however, I would like to
comment briefly on what characteristics we might expect the entire curriculum to have—
the trunk and the branches—as it gradually develops, if it is to meet the requirements of
capacity building as we discussed yesterday.

A process of capacity building in the protagonists of our global plans will obviously
involve imparting knowledge. This has to be done, of course, in such a way that the
participants are fully engaged in the process, ensuring that they gain a sense of ownership
of their learning. They cannot be treated as passive recipients of someone else’s
knowledge. In fact, every effort has to be made to help them to engage in the generation,
application and diffusion of knowledge, each according to his or her own possibilities.
To achieve this, the educational process must connect the participants to two sources of
knowledge, the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, on the one hand, and the Bahá’í experience in
applying the teachings and principles of the Faith, on the other. It needs to involve the
friends in the creation of this experience and in its diffusion.

Knowledge needs to be treated in this educational process in such a way that it enables
the participants to avoid bigotry and fanaticism. Knowledge should not lead to rigidity of
thought, narrow-mindedness, and intolerance. But neither should it result in that extreme
form of liberalism that tends to deny the very existence of limits and bounds. One of the

precepts of the Faith is that religious truth is relative, but this is not the kind of relativism
that is being propagated in the world today. It is one thing to say that human
understanding is limited and therefore evolves, and another to deny the existence of
absolutes, presenting, in a most contradictory way, as the only absolute the equal validity
of the opinions, the desires, and the wants of the individual as shaped by culture.

Our communities, of course, are protected against such extremes. But if this brand of
relativism is allowed to influence us, the result is paralysis, as the will of the individual is
granted supreme importance and the community is pulled in a thousand directions. To
promote the process of entry by troops and to participate in it effectively requires, as the
House of Justice puts it, “clarity and single-mindedness”. Progress is not to be made by
“spasmodic, uncoordinated exertions”.

Further, knowledge must lead to certitude. “By faith is meant, first, conscious knowledge
and second, the practice of good deeds” are the words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Entry by troops
involves walking the path of learning with humility and openness, yet with certitude.

An educational process aimed at building capacity to contribute towards the process of
entry by troops has to be concerned, of course, with more than the cognitive: the
workings of the human brain. The reality of the human being is the soul, and the soul has
no material existence. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has explained that mental faculties are “inherent
properties of the soul, even as the radiation of light is the essential property of the sun.”
“It is through the power of the soul,” He states, “that the mind comprehendeth, imagineth
and exerteth its influence, whilst the soul is a power that is free. The mind
comprehendeth the abstract by the aid of the concrete, but the soul hath limitless
manifestations of its own. The mind is circumscribed, the soul limitless. It is by the aid
of such senses as those of sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch, that the mind
comprehendeth, whereas, the soul is free from all agencies.”

Working for the advancement of entry by troops surely requires more than an
understanding of the abstract reached through the concrete. It is in need of such powers
as inner sight and inner hearing, with the aid of which, for example, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
assures us we can see the immortality of the soul as clearly as we see the sun.

One of the greatest powers seeded in the depths of the human soul is attraction to beauty.
Capacity building needs to awaken, nurture and direct it. At one level, attraction to
beauty manifests itself in an individual’s impulse to fashion beauty through the visual
arts, music, and crafts, and the pleasure he or she derives from beholding the fruits of
these creative endeavors. It motivates search for order, meaning and balance, and creates
drive for excellence. At another level it makes obedience a most joyous act, a response to
Bahá’u’lláh’s exhortation: “Observe My commandments for the love of My beauty.”
How else is the ardent lover of Bahá’u’lláh to understand the mystery of sacrifice, to
persist, and to overcome the formidable difficulties that inevitably arise in the path of
service to His Cause?

One of the ills that has affected most of the educational systems of the world today is the
identification of knowledge with information. The development of the various faculties
of the soul, as I have mentioned here, requires an educational process that enables the
individual to reach the shores of true understanding. There is a longing in every human
heart for meaning; there is a natural craving for knowledge of the outer and inner realities
of creation. Every soul yearns to understand the purpose for its existence. Clearly, the
process of capacity building in which we are engaged needs to foster the understanding of
such essential metaphysical themes. But, at a more practical level, being a protagonist in
the work of entry by troops requires an ever-deepening understanding of such subjects as
the nature of the historical moment in which we live, the relationship between personal
growth and organic change in institutional structures, and the operation of forces that
transform people and society—to mention only a few. In this context, the nature of
receptivity to the call of Bahá’u’lláh, it seems to me, is an object of understanding of
particular significance. So, too, is the related subject of oppression as defined in the
Book of Certitude: “What ‘oppression’ is more grievous than that a soul seeking the
truth, and wishing to attain unto the knowledge of God, should know not where to go for
it and from whom to seek it?”

Bahá’u’lláh has told us that the gift of understanding, which is first and foremost among
God’s favors, gives us the power to discern the truth in all things. The ability to
distinguish truth from falsehood is surely indispensable for one who wishes to act on a
society in which the distinction between the two has become blurred. Without this ability
it would be difficult to attain the “rectitude of conduct” that Shoghi Effendi includes
among the “chief propelling forces” that can “most effectively accelerate” the march of
our “institutions, plans, and enterprises”.

Shattering the idols of superstition is another demand made on our educational endeavors
by the human condition today. “People for the most part delight in superstitions,”
Bahá’u’lláh warns us. “They regard a single drop of the sea of delusion as preferable to
an ocean of certitude. By holding fast unto names they deprive themselves of the inner
reality and by clinging to vain imaginings they are kept back from the Dayspring of
heavenly signs. God grant you may be graciously aided under all conditions to shatter
the idols of superstition and to tear away the veils of the imaginations of men.”

Thus, the fostering of true understanding involves burning away the “veils” of the
imaginations of men. The implications for the work of entry by troops are great. To
dispel the mists of doubts and misgivings in a seeker’s heart, the friends and the
institutions must learn how to remove obstacles that keep people from entering the City
of Certitude. The Guardian has identified a number of such obstacles: “gross
materialism,” “the attachment to worldly things that enshrouds the souls of men; the fears
and anxieties that distract their minds; the pleasure and dissipations that fill their time, the
prejudices and animosities that darken their outlook, the apathy and lethargy that paralyze
their spiritual faculties”. Further, he has reminded us that our ability to remove these
obstacles will depend on the degree to which we ourselves are cleansed of “these
impurities,” liberated from “these petty preoccupations and gnawing anxieties,” freed

from “these prejudices and antagonisms”, “emptied of self” and “filled by the healing and
the sustaining power of God”.

Freedom is yet another essential concern of capacity building in the context we are
considering here. The freedom to which we are referring, of course, is not the same as
liberty to follow the dictates of a lower nature. Quite the opposite. “And among the
teachings of His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh is man’s freedom,” says ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “that
through the Ideal Power he should be emancipated and free from the captivity of the
world of nature.” The path that leads to this “liberation”, of course, is not the path of
personal salvation but that of service to the Cause of unity and well-being of the human
race.

This suggests that the process of capacity building in which we are involved should place
God—and, as a corollary, service to His loved ones—at its center. While this may seem
like an obvious statement, it is not that straightforward. In helping individuals to gain
knowledge of their own selves and to develop their talents in service to the Cause and
humanity, one can inadvertently end up building the ego and, far from liberating souls,
further enchain them in the fetters of self. A sense of superiority, desire for recognition,
ambition and pride can then take hold and consume the soul. To build capacity in a way
that quiets the ego is a formidable challenge.

The various characteristics of capacity building I have mentioned up to now point to
another extremely important one: Capacity building must necessarily be concerned with
raising consciousness. All created things do not exist at the same level of consciousness.
Compare a rock with a bird, and a bird with a human being. The differences between the
state of consciousness of one human being and another can be as vast. A heightened
awareness of potentialities and responsibilities, of the need to be an active force rather
than an spectator of events, awareness of the nature of each historical moment, of the
many processes that together create the forward march of the Cause at that moment, of
the forces that act on society, and of the spiritual forces that are at one’s disposal—these
are some of the matters on which consciousness raising in our case needs to focus. Just
to know about something is not the same as being acutely aware of it and allowing it to
influence one’s thoughts and actions consistently.

An educational process with the explicit aim of raising consciousness, however, has to
take into account an important fact. Our environment instills in many of us a fear of
moving to new levels of awareness. Living one’s own life quietly, doing, of course, no
harm to anyone, offers us a degree of comfort that we learn to cherish. Becoming aware
of wider responsibilities, we may fear, will bring pain and demand for sacrifice. But such
fear is unfounded. At higher levels of consciousness sacrifice is a harbinger of joy, not a
source of pain.

Every educational endeavor is, without doubt, concerned with motivation. But beyond
the question of motivation, we are engaged in an educational process that seeks to create
ardent desire. “When training and encouragement are effective, a culture of growth is
nourished in which the believers see their duty to teach as a natural consequence of

having accepted Bahá’u’lláh,” the Universal House of Justice has written. “So enkindled
do their hearts become with the fire of the love of God that whoever approaches them
feels its warmth… In such a culture, teaching is the dominating passion of the lives of
the believers.”

The human heart was created to harbor desire, to have passion. The question is: What
kind of passion? What kind of desire? Spiritual development enables us to control our
lower passions, our worldly desires. The final result, however, is not a dead heart but one
in which, in the words of Bahá’u’lláh, “the lamp of search, of earnest striving, of longing
desire, of passionate devotion, of fervid love, of rapture, and ecstasy” has been kindled.
To be a protagonist of the Five Year Plan, for example, calls for a passionate desire to see
the process of entry by troops advance in one’s cluster.

Clearly desire is one of the forces that comes into play when we are to translate thought
into action. Yet, by itself, it is not sufficient. Our educational process must be as
concerned with strengthening the force of will as it is with desire, and seek to create
channels through which it can express itself. Some tend to believe that, if one
understands a thing well, then one will necessarily act on it. But it is doubtful that the
equation is that simple. It is easy to see that a just person will not knowingly commit acts
of injustice, but what needs to be done to ensure that he or she will actively labor for the
cause of justice? The will to act has to be nurtured and guided in the right direction in an
educational process—this, besides the fostering of understanding and ardent desire.
What is more, “will” is something that can be broken in a person, an institution or a
community, and it often needs to be patiently rebuilt as part of a process of capacity
building.

This much for the general characteristics of what we should expect from our institute
process. Let us now examine some of the more specific features of the main sequence of
courses with which you have been involved for several years. Because, by now, you
know more about it than I do, it will be difficult for me not to repeat things you have
already read in the books of the sequence and other relevant documents. In fact, a
number of times I will have to almost quote from some of those documents. I do hope,
however, that the overall treatment of the subject will offer you a few insights that will
help you in your reflections.

First: The courses offered by your institutes, we have said, try to respond to the needs of
entry by troops. They have been developed in accordance with a particular understanding
of large-scale expansion and consolidation, one that views it as the movement of
receptive populations towards the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh. This movement is
eminently spiritual. It occurs fundamentally in the hearts and minds of individuals, but
gradually manifests itself in the entire social, economic, and cultural pattern of life and in
institutional structure. Teaching in its broadest sense propels this movement. The
training institute is an engine that drives the movement at this particular stage in the
unfoldment of the Divine Plan.

Second: It is natural to expect that individuals within a population will not tread their
spiritual paths at the same pace. At any given moment the population will present a
continuum of responses, from the indifference of those who are barely aware of the
existence of the Cause, to the intense devotion of those who have dedicated their lives to
its promotion. The classification of Bahá’ís in mutually exclusive categories—active and
inactive, deepened and undeepened, spiritualized and unspiritualized—has little place in
this view of entry by troops. Even undue emphasis on a Bahá’í/non-Bahá’í duality
proves to be harmful in that it creates unnecessary barriers to the progress of individual
souls and reinforces an inward mindset that impedes large-scale expansion.

Third: The spiritual transformation of a people is an organic process that must be
propelled from within by forces of transformation directly generated by the power of the
Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, which are allowed to grow in strength and range of influence.
In a closely-knit worldwide network of Bahá’í communities, it is natural and highly
desirable to have an exchange of resources among them, and in almost every instance,
this spiritual movement has to begin in a given population by someone coming from
some other place. But if expansion is to reach the level of entry by troops, an increasing
number of individuals from within the population have to rise and assume ownership of
the process. The guidance of the institutions of the Faith, of course, is not to be
considered intervention from outside, for these—whether local, regional, national,
continental, or international—belong to every population in which the seed of a Bahá’í
community has begun to germinate.

Fourth: The spiritual dynamics of the educational process that fosters the movement of a
people towards the Bahá’í civilization is essentially the same for the poor and the rich, for
the villagers and the urban dwellers, the educated and the illiterate. All new believers
must have the benefit of a nurturing process that allows them to become confirmed in the
Faith as they gradually dedicate more time and resources to its service. A few
individuals, no matter how outstanding, how knowledgeable and how dedicated, cannot
take exclusive responsibility for this nurturing process if the rate of enrollments is to
become significant. A process of the development of human resources is needed that
focuses on those who are willing and able to learn and to move faster so that they can
dedicate themselves to assisting their fellow believers and to helping new souls recognize
the Manifestation of God for today.

These points led those who initiated the experience of the Ruhi Institute to view human
resource development in a particular way, that is: as a process that creates in an
increasing number of individuals whole-hearted dedication to the spiritual development
of their people. The training institute, which is the agency entirely focused on this
process, must, of course, address the spiritual growth of the individual participant of its
programs. But an individual’s spiritual condition and his or her progress are matters that
only God can judge. The Ruhi Institute was acutely aware of this fact. It did not wish to
assume in any way the responsibility of measuring people’s spirituality or even the extent
of their knowledge of the Revelation. The Institute adopted a pedagogical approach that
concerns itself exclusively with ways in which individuals can be helped to increase their
capacity to serve. This capacity is without a doubt intimately connected to spirituality,

but the relation need not be defined precisely. It is sufficient to know that the field of
service represents an environment within which spirituality can be cultivated.

The sequence of courses we are examining, then, is not arranged according to a series of
subject matters, chosen with the specific goal of increasing an individual’s knowledge of
the Faith. If that were the case, this particular sequence would have never been selected.
The content and the order are based on a series of acts of service, the practice of which
creates capacity in the individual to meet the needs of large-scale expansion and
consolidation. The development of such capacity is viewed in terms of “walking a path
of service”. On such a path the friends are assisted first in accomplishing relatively
simple tasks and then in performing more complex and demanding acts of service. This
is the nature of capacity building. Someone accompanies you as you learn to walk the
path by yourself. If you fall, there is somebody close by to give you a hand. Mistakes
are accepted. Confidence is gradually built. Setting grandiose goals and whipping up
enthusiasm through constant emotional appeals are avoided.

Nevertheless, the goals set for the overall process are quite ambitious. The path leads to
great heights and the vision of these heights becomes increasingly clear as one advances
along the path. Yet each individual is allowed to learn to contribute to the overall
objectives according to his or her own understanding, desire and will, all of which grow
as individuals move forward, some rapidly and some at a slow pace.

The choice of the acts of service addressed in the sequence is dictated by at least two sets
of considerations. The first has to do with strategies for community development.
Yesterday, we talked about building capacity in the three protagonists of the Plan—the
individual, the community and the institutions. In a process of large-scale expansion and
consolidation, the development of capacity at the level of the community involves
implementing a sequence of activities, according to well-conceived strategies arising
from actual experience. The lack of such strategies was one of the reasons the process of
entry by troops could not be sustained in the decades past. Too much was asked of
nascent communities and institutions, particularly Local Assemblies, the establishment
and full functioning of which are, of course, the ardent desire of every Bahá’í who
appreciates the significance of the Administrative Order. The acts of service treated in
the main sequence of courses, then, are intended to set in motion a process that will lead
to the sound development of local communities or, as envisioned in the Five Year Plan,
of clusters. A plan of growth for the cluster is, in some sense, embedded in the sequence
of courses, a fact that by now must be apparent to you.

The other determinant of the content and order of the books, to which I have alluded
earlier, is to be found in the dynamics of service itself. The skills needed to perform one
act of service must benefit from skills already acquired. Of course, there is a great deal
of individual leeway in this respect. No laws are broken if someone jumps from Book 1
to Book 4, and back to Book 2, and so on. In some cases, this may even increase the
effectiveness of the courses for a specific group of people. But, on the whole, the
pedagogical reasons for the order need to be understood and respected.

It is a fact borne by experience that, wherever large-scale expansion occurs, the vast
majority of those who enter the Faith need to follow a sequence that starts with relatively
simple acts of service and gradually builds ability and confidence. The worldwide
experience with the sequence of courses prepared by the Ruhi Institute, however, began
in many cases with Bahá’ís who were already deepened in the Faith and capable of
carrying out rather complex acts of service. So visiting someone and sharing a prayer or
presenting a deepening theme seemed trivial in a certain sense. But it is interesting to
note that, in many of the places where certain books were initially set aside or the
practice of skills treated too hastily, the friends ended up going back and undertaking a
more thorough study of the full sequence when faced with the challenge of multiplying
the core activities of the Five Year Plan. One can be extremely able in many complex
areas of service, but have difficulty with apparently simple ones. For example, striking
up the kind of conversation that leads naturally to an invitation to join a devotional
meeting or a study circle is proving formidable in regions where social conditions make
opening community activities to seekers a challenge. Sharing a prayer or two with a few
friends, as required by the first book of the sequence, or practicing how to engage people
in conversations on spiritual themes, as encouraged by the second book, are among the
ways that one can begin to develop the skills required.

In applying the main sequence of courses as they stand, then, there has to be some degree
of flexibility, but without sacrificing the specific pedagogical requirements of the
material. In general, the pedagogy, as I understand it, has the intention to weave together
a number of elements that are sometimes held in opposition to one another, but in reality
are not. In fact, one hopes that as individuals progress through the courses, the tendency
to reduce reality to a set of dichotomies will gradually be overcome. You already know
how the material strives to achieve this aim.

The books endeavor to make explicit the complementarity of “being” and “doing”. They
try to convey the idea that perfection of an individual’s character naturally finds
expression in efforts to serve others, while one’s desire to serve others enhances the
refinement of one’s character. We cannot wait all our lives with the hope of reaching a
state of inner perfection before we act. Even the smallest of flames gives warmth and
light. In fact the flame cannot help but to give warmth. Motivation to serve comes from
within, and one arises to render service not out of a begrudging sense of duty but because
service is a natural state of being.

This simultaneous concern with “being” and “doing” is reflected in the way the sequence
of courses strives to foster true understanding. The pedagogy in question does not deny
the possibility of reaching the shores of true understanding through mere study,
meditation and prayer. Understanding is a gift bestowed by God, and He will confer it on
whomsoever He pleases, as He pleases. Yet it is doubtful that understanding in the
context of acquiring capacity to effect the dual transformation we discussed yesterday can
be fully developed in a pedagogy that ignores the role of action in fostering
understanding and promotes the pursuit of erudition outside the field of service.

Another challenge the material tries to meet is how to address the question of
consciousness raising, while at the same time reinforcing effort to move towards a state
of selflessness. Although the two are not contradictory, consciousness raising, if
approached inadequately, can lead to self-centeredness. The process can be distorted by
focusing too much attention on one’s self. “My interests”, “my talents”, “my service”,
“what I can do for the Cause”, “my personal initiative”—these are, in themselves,
legitimate concerns of one who wishes to arise and serve. But if they become the central
issue occupying the mind, they sap energy and burden the soul. Judging from the results
achieved so far around the world, the material in question does seem to demonstrate that
it is possible to raise awareness of one’s responsibilities, of one’s opportunities, of the
spiritual powers at one’s disposal, without feeding the ego and without fanning the fire of
excitement with self.

Other false dichotomies that the material attempts to avoid are the usual ones between the
heart and the mind, between setting goals and being process-minded, between spirituality
and systematic thinking. The books are intended to show that strategic, methodical
thinking does not contradict passion and enthusiasm. One can be occupied with the most
profound spiritual matters, and yet be willing to take care of the smallest practical details.

Another feature of the material is that its effectiveness depends on a rather quick pace of
study, as well as the thorough deliberation of important matters. The result of this
emphasis on what may sound to be opposite concerns is, it is hoped, the ability to avoid
the kind of superficiality that treats everything—the complex and the simple—in the
same way. In this respect, various levels of understanding are called for, and an effort
has been made in the material to organize the content accordingly.

The study of the Bahá’í writings is, of course, at the heart of approach to learning adopted
by the sequence of books. Learning to align one’s thoughts and actions with the writings
is an explicit aim of the entire sequence. In the pursuit of this aim, every effort is made
to avoid both the kind of inflexible literalism that consists of “finding the right answer” to
every question and the kind of relativism that promotes prolonged exchange of personal
views on “what the quotation means to me.” Respect for the diversity of opinions is
fostered, while at the same time consensus is highly prized. The need for clear and
precise answers in accordance with the teachings is clearly acknowledged, as is the
indispensable nature of questions that do not admit simple answers.

To achieve all this, the role of the tutor, which is defined in rather complex terms, is
essential. He or she is to encourage participation without pressuring any individual to
speak, to discourage error without becoming the arbiter of truth, to promote adherence to
the Writings without acting as a source of knowledge. The tutor is not an intermediary
between the students and the Writings; his or her purpose is precisely to accustom the
students with the practice of going to the source directly to explore the questions that will
constantly arise as they try to walk their own path of service.

With all these features of the present sequence of courses being offered by your institutes
you are already familiar. Books further along in the sequence will surely follow the same

pedagogical principles. In describing the material, I have been careful to choose phrases
like “tries to”, “strives to”, “attempts to”. To what extent good intentions are actually
realized in the material is a question that will only be answered as the process of entry by
troops advances. All we can say right now is that the worldwide results at this time
appear quite promising. I would like to bring today’s talk to a close by emphasizing a
couple of points and then let you go off to your group reflections.

You have often heard that the methodology of the Ruhi Institute is participatory. This is,
of course, an exigency of capacity building itself. None of us could develop the capacity
to perform the kinds of acts of service the process of entry by troops requires of us by just
being told about them. But what I would like to bring to your attention is that there is
more than one dimension to this participation. There is, of course, the question of the
method of teaching-learning. Lessons are designed so as to keep the participants engaged
in the activity of the study group, and every effort is made to ensure that each individual
takes charge of his or her own learning. How often a person speaks in a session or how
eloquently he or she expresses ideas is not the issue here. What is at stake is the level of
consciousness achieved, the will created, the desire aroused, and the degree to which
what is being learned is internalized and translated into action.

But there is another dimension to the question of participation that needs to be fully
appreciated. A quick look at education in another area may help us to briefly explore this
dimension. Take the study of science, in which everyone here has been involved to a
certain degree, some joyfully and others with measurable pain. We all realize that
science is not what is written in textbooks; these give an account of the knowledge
accumulated in the field and hopefully familiarize students with appropriate methods.
But far beyond this is what scientists do. Scientific activity takes place in communities of
scientists who are engaged in a common enterprise and participate in a discourse that has
its roots in the conversation of scientists of the past, an ongoing discourse, to the
advancement of which every scientist tries to contribute. So one can ask the question:
When does one cease to be a student of science and become a scientist? Clearly studying
the textbooks, listening to lectures, contributing to class discussions, and carrying out
experiments in the school laboratory are only steps—for those who will become
scientists—towards participation in the global scientific enterprise and its historical
discourse.

Now, we are members of communities scattered across the globe that are engaged in the
greatest of all enterprises, that of building a new civilization. Our conversations—
conversations in action—about the various aspects of this enterprise are carried out in so
many settings: the Nineteen Day Feast, meetings of Spiritual Assemblies and
Committees, Summer Schools, deepening classes, conferences, teaching projects, social
and economic development endeavors, and so on. The main sequence of courses of the
training institute seeks to systematize a crucial aspect of our global discourse concerned
with the advancement of the process of entry by troops. An increasing number of people
in every corner of the globe are engaged in such conversations in a setting we call a study
circle. The material we study organizes this conversation. It records the principal points

and ensures that our thoughts and actions are illumined by relevant passages from the
writings of the Faith.

In this setting, the tutor of the study circle is saying something like this: “We are walking
a path of service that allows us to contribute to the advancement of the process of entry
by troops. The way we do this is by studying, acting and reflecting on action in the light
of what we have studied. These materials have helped me develop some of the
capabilities I need to walk this path. I believe they will help you as well. Thousands of
other groups in the world are doing the same. They are having the same conversation and
a vast experience is being created among peoples of every background under diverse
conditions. What we do will be part of this global experience. What we say enriches the
conversation. What we learn will be systematized and diffused among communities
throughout the world by the institutions we have already established. Our participation in
this study circle can be seen in this light. We are participating in a global learning
process, learning that builds the capacity of the Bahá’í community to open wide its doors
to the peoples of the world and enable them to enter the Tabernacle of the Covenant in
troops.

Friends, yesterday in your smaller group meetings you examined how the capacity of your
communities to foster the process of entry by troops has been enhanced during the past few
years. Reflections today may continue on the theme of capacity building, but now focused on
the individual. The main question is how the institute process—the books, the study circles,
the institute campaigns, the tutors, the gathering of the tutors, the practice of the various acts
of service—are contributing to the enhancement of the capacity of the individual believer in
Australia to act as a protagonist of the Five Year Plan. Some specific questions may be:

How are the knowledge imparted in the courses and the understanding engendered helping
the individual believer to contribute to the advancement of the process of entry by troops?

What are some of the insights the friends are getting from the study of the courses as to how
the process of entry by troops can be advanced?

How is the use of the arts being addressed and appreciation for beauty enhanced?

What are some of the noticeable effects of the emphasis on the Creative Word?

To what extent are the courses serving as instruments for raising awareness of the roles and
responsibilities of the individual believer?

What are some of the signs of increased consciousness that are readily observed?

Are their observable signs of increased desire and will to serve and to teach?

How is the ability to learn from experience enhanced?

In which ways does the individual believer in Australia see himself or herself as a participant
in the discourse of the Baha’i community worldwide on how to advance the process of entry
by troops?

In which ways does the individual believer in Australia see himself or herself as a protagonist
in a global enterprise, the aim of which is to build a new civilization?
