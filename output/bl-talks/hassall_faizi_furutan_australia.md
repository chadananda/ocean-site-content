> **About:** Transcripts of tape recordings made of the talks of Mr Faizi and Mr Furútan in Australia, December 1953 - January 1954 \[the southern-hemisphere summer\]. These recordings were forgotten, and only years later rediscovered in the National Bahá’í Archives at Mona Vale. The process of retrieving the talks took a number of years. Robert Mannell transferred the recordings from the original “reel to reel” format to cassettes. Alan Waters made the first transcripts. Mr Ghodratollah Ahmadian then compared the transcripts with the audio tapes, checking the text with the Persian and Arabic of Mr Furútan, and the English of Mr Faizi. Mr Ahmadian also annotated the text to make it more accessible to the reader.

At the commencement of the Ten Year Crusade, in 1953, Shoghi Effendi

> Furútan were given a welcome reception at Hazíratu’l-Quds in Sydney on 9
> December. They had arrived from Auckland, New Zealand, the previous day,
> and were to travel to Queensland before turning south again to Yerrinbool,
> where the summer school was scheduled to start late in the month. Earlier, they
> had visited South Australia. Shoghi Effendi wrote to Leila V. Clark, secretary
> of the Local Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Payneham:

He was most happy to hear of the visit made to the Groups of St. Peters
> and Stirling and to your own Community by the honoured Hand of the
> Cause of God, Dr. Furútan, and Mr. Faizi. These believers have rendered

Some seventy Bahá’ís attended the 1953-54 summer school. They came

Foreword

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, currents of religious
> change long perceptible in the west became far more pronounced. Long es-
> tablished religions lost adherents to agnosticism on the one hand and, on the
> other, to newer, more individualistic religions which were less institutionally
> and liturgically oriented. From as early as the mid-eighteenth century, women
> had bulked increasingly large in the church congregations of the west as men
> tended to stand aside from religion and dedicate themselves to a more and
> more secularised public world of work and politics. This trend too became
> more pronounced in the late nineteenth century, but a new feature now came
> to the fore: women rose to striking public visibility in organised religious
> activity, assuming organisational and leadership roles on a scale surpassing
> even that of the radical religious turmoil associated with mid­-seventeenth
century Protestantism.

Against this European background I want to take up the story of Margaret
> Dixson in Australia. Her shift from Anglicanism, via numerology, astrology
> and commitment to the world ideals implicit in Esperanto, to the teachings of
> Bahá’í, on the one hand reflects the widespread change occurring in western
> Protestant religion we have noted. But beyond that it also traces out a far from
> uncommon pattern the historian is able to discern among Australian religious
women of her time.

My grandmother Margaret Dixson was born Margaret Bertha Shann on
> Wednesday, 11 July 1877 at 12.50 pm (her horoscope, 1926) and died at the
> age of sixty two in Melbourne, 1939. My grandmother’s life, and that of my
> father, was deeply shaped by the circumstances of my great-grandfather’s story,
above all by the breakup of his marriage somewhere in the 1880s.

My great-grandfather Frank Shann, Margaret’s father, was the twelfth
