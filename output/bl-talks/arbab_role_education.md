                 Notes from a Series of Talks by Dr. Farzam Arbab

          The Role of Education in Building Material and Spiritual Civilization

I would like to thank the National Spiritual Assembly for giving me the opportunity to
participate in this delightful gathering. The main purpose of the conference, as I
understand it, is for you to reflect on your efforts to expand and consolidate your
community over the past few years. My pleasant duty, during these days, is to share with
you some related thoughts on the question of education and on the nature of the Five
Year Plan to assist you in your reflections. The Australian Bahá’í community has made
significant strides especially during the Five Year Plan, and it has been a pleasure to
witness from afar your impressive achievements as you learned systematically, built on
your accomplishments, and moved to the forefront of Bahá’í activity worldwide.

Your National Spiritual Assembly has organized the conference in such a way that the
themes of education and the Five Year Plan are woven together. I will begin my talk this
morning with a few remarks on the question of the context of education—the
philosophical, ideological, and historical context of the educational process in which the
Bahá’í world has been engaged since the beginning of the Four Year Plan. I will then
move on to a discussion of education as capacity building. Tomorrow, we will pick up
the same subjects but will talk about them in more specific terms. First, I would like to
make a few remarks on personal transformation, introducing in the process a distinction
between what I am calling here our collective educational endeavors and our efforts as
individuals to deepen ourselves.

In The Advent of Divine Justice, Shoghi Effendi tells us that “the supreme and
distinguishing function” of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation” is “none other than the calling into
being of a new race of men”. The splendor of the attributes that will characterize this
new human being, as described in the Writings, is beyond our current ability to
appreciate. “Who can measure”, the Guardian, contemplating the future, asks, “the
heights to which human intelligence, liberated from its shackles, will soar? Who can
visualize the realms which the human spirit, vitalized by the outpouring light of
Bahá’u’lláh, shining in the plenitude of its glory, will discover?” You are all familiar
with numerous passages that offer us glimpses into the nature and character of the
individual who is destined to emerge under the direct influence of Bahá’u’lláh’s
Revelation:

     A race of men, incomparable in character, shall be raised up which, with the feet
     of detachment, will tread under all who are in heaven and on earth, and will cast
     the sleeve of holiness over all that hath been created from water and clay.

     Within the very breath of such souls as are pure and sanctified far-reaching
     potentialities are hidden. So great are these potentialities that they exercise their
     influence upon all created things.

“A treasure to the poor,” “an admonisher to the rich,” “an answerer of the cry of the
needy,” “a joy to the sorrowful,” “a sea for the thirsty,” “a haven for the distressed,” “an
upholder and defender of the victim of oppression,” “a balm to the suffering,” “eyes to
the blind,” “an ornament to the countenance of truth,” “a crown to the brow of fidelity,”
“a pillar of the temple of righteousness,” “a breath of life to the body of mankind,” “an
ensign of the hosts of justice,” “an ark on the ocean of knowledge,” “a sun in the heaven
of bounty,” “a gem on the diadem of wisdom,” “a fruit upon the tree of humility,” these
are the kinds of words that describe this new human being.

When we reflect on such statements, and contemplate the life of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá who
exemplified them, we are dazzled by the glimpses we get of the powers and capacities of
this new creation—by the level of understanding the individual will attain, by the abilities
and skills he or she will possess, by the attitudes and qualities that will characterize his or
her being. We begin to realize that the Writings call for a most profound transformation
at the level of the individual and recognize that education will have to play an
increasingly important role in propelling it.

It will, of course, take centuries for this transformation, whose demands are
overwhelming indeed, to occur. But what is clear is that the vision of the new human
being has to be present whenever we try to address the question of education. For if we
close our eyes to this vision, we become vulnerable to enticement by the elaborate
trappings of the superficiality that is being propagated aggressively throughout the planet
in the name of progress, a superficiality that is a necessary characteristic of a world in
disintegration.

This extraordinary vision of a new human being has implications for both our personal
and our collective lives. A fundamental question before every one of us is: What do I
have to do in order to align my thoughts and actions with those of the individual depicted
in the Writings and how do I help others do the same? One immediate answer is that we
need to turn constantly to the Writings and strive, through diligent study, to gain a better
and better understanding of the nature of the transformation that is required. And, we
should exert daily effort to translate what we understand into action. We all engage, of
course, in such study, and much of what we call deepening is undertaken precisely with
this aim in mind.

Those of us interested in the field of education, professionally or otherwise, usually strive
to go a step further. We try to gain insight into the dynamics of the educational process
from passages in the Writings and to use this understanding to enhance our study of
prevalent educational theories and their approaches, methods and materials—this in an
attempt to formulate our own view of education and its underlying concepts. One
important reason for doing so is to increase our ability to influence educational efforts

outside the Bahá’í community with the teachings and principles of the Faith, and this is
indeed a worthy aim.

But beyond our concern as individual believers with our own personal transformation,
and as educators with influencing the field of education, we are all participants in the
collective educational endeavors of the Bahá’í community, and it is mostly in this sense
that we will be discussing education here. These collective endeavors elicit the
commitment of a diverse community of people coming from widely different
backgrounds, including some from the field of education, each bringing to our collective
exertions his or her experience, knowledge and talents. Glancing at the participants in
this conference alone, one gets a sense of the unique richness of the human resources that
participate in our educational efforts.

Now these collective educational endeavors of the Bahá’í community will necessarily be
much more than aggregates of our individual deepening efforts. Their aims, which will
cover a broad range of both individual and collective accomplishments, will not be
reached by courses of study that merely teach us how things will be in the future, the
heights to which we will ascend, and the kind of individuals we are to become, although
such courses of study are, without doubt, required. Beyond these, our collective
educational endeavors must bring to light the philosophical, ideological and cultural
elements that define the historical enterprise in which the Bahá’í community is engaged:
to build a new civilization—and we should remember, of course, that every educational
system develops within one or another ideological and cultural context.

Clearly, the process of personal transformation mentioned before is an important part of
the larger process of civilization building. But what is essential to realize is that all the
necessary philosophical and ideological underpinnings of our educational programs will
not come from those teachings that are concerned with the individual and with personal
transformation. In fact, if we focus exclusively on that one process, we will have
inadvertently adopted at least some of the undesirable elements of the individualistic
ideologies that are so prevalent today. Our writings emphasize an equally profound
transformation in the structure of society, parallel and complementary to personal
transformation. You are well familiar with the Guardian’s statement that

     We cannot segregate the human heart from the environment outside us and say
     that once one of these is reformed everything will be improved. Man is organic
     with the world. His inner life moulds the environment and is itself also deeply
     affected by it. The one acts upon the other and every abiding change in the life of
     man is the result of these mutual reactions.

In the dynamics of this dual transformation—personal and in the structure of society—I
would like to suggest, we must seek some of the most significant philosophical and
ideological underpinnings of our educational endeavors. It is the process of civilization
building these two transformations engender that should be the context within which we
design and implement the educational programs of our communities. This may seem to
be an obvious fact, but it can easily be forgotten. Your National Spiritual Assembly is

clearly well aware of it, since it has called for a conference to address education in the
context of the Five Year Plan. We may express the connection between the two
interwoven themes of the conference in the following way:

As a community, we are concerned with the transformation of both the individual and
society and with the interaction between the two. We can, of course, promote this dual
process by contributing to the projects of other groups with like-minded aims, and we
certainly do so with the understanding that the Major Plan of God, in compliance with
which very complex global forces act on every individual and nation, is moving humanity
irresistibly closer to its destiny. Yet, we have a specific Bahá’í enterprise, our own
historical endeavor, in which we are vigorously engaged as a community. This historical
enterprise is anything but haphazard. It has clearly defined parameters. It proceeds in
successive stages that are governed by the global plans given to us by the Head of the
Faith: the unfoldment of the Divine Plan.

The success of each stage of this worldwide, historical enterprise depends on the capacity
of the Bahá’í community to respond to the provisions set forth in the global plan that
defines that stage. This capacity is not built merely by our seeking, as individuals, truths
in the Sacred Scripture of the Faith and trying to live according to its exhortations and
precepts. Clearly this is a matter of considerable import. But, apart from such personal
exertions, an educational process is required that creates in the community as a whole the
capacity to respond to the exigencies of the Divine Plan as it unfolds. At each stage, the
logic and the structure of this educational process must necessarily be derived from the
logic and structure of the global plan that governs our activity at that particular juncture.

With these thoughts in mind, let us reflect for a moment on the circumstances in which
the Four Year, Twelve Month and Five Year Plans of the Faith were formulated by the
Universal House of Justice. At Ridván 1996, when the House of Justice launched the
Four Year Plan, the Community of the Greatest Name had already earned an impressive
record of achievements. It had succeeded in implanting the banner of the Faith in every
region of the globe and had proven its ability to unite people of divers backgrounds. It
had laid the foundations of Bahá’u’lláh’s Administrative Order and had raised up its
institutions in the remotest corners of the world. It had established the process of
consultation as a tool for collective decision-making and had educated its members in its
use. It had shown its capacity to bring in fresh recruits and to deepen them in the verities
of the Faith, and to educate children and youth according to its precepts. It had emerged
from obscurity and was demonstrating its potential to influence policy and thought in
international fora, having specially become known for its stance on issues such as racial
unity, human rights and the equality of men and women.

It was against the background of such victories, painstakingly won in the previous stages
of the Divine Plan, that the House of Justice decided to call upon the Bahá’í world in its
Ridván 1996 message to focus on one major accomplishment: a significant advance in
the process of entry by troops. We know, of course, from its subsequent messages, that
this central aim will continue to be the focus of the series of worldwide plans that will

carry the Bahá’í community through the final years in the first century of the Faith’s
Formative Age.

To appreciate the significance of this call to advance the process of entry by troops, we
need to have at least some knowledge of the different patterns that have characterized the
growth of the community since its inception. Most of you are familiar with these patterns
of growth, but let me describe them briefly here.

When the Twin Manifestations of God appeared, powerful spiritual forces were released
in the world, and in Iran, thousands upon thousands of pure-hearted souls were affected
by this burst of spiritual energy. It was a very special period of time in the history of the
Faith, during which the number of adherents grew extremely fast. This rapid, intense
growth was accompanied by a wave of persecutions, which the enemies of the Cause had
hoped would extinguish the flame of faith enkindled in the hearts of so many and would
erase all traces of the newly born religion. They succeeded, we know, in killing
thousands of innocent believers. We also know, however, that for every drop of blood
shed by those precious souls, hundreds and thousands would arise to serve the Faith. Here
we are as a testimony to the truth of this statement.

During His Ministry, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá began to systematically build Bahá’í communities
around the world. Under His watchful eye, the community in Iran grew and prospered,
establishing, for example, such social institutions as schools and hospitals. In the West,
particularly in North America, He raised up a band of dedicated believers and prepared
the way for the future unfoldment of the Divine Plan. Your own community came into
existence through the efforts of two outstanding souls who responded to His call.

The pattern of growth that the Guardian established, as he set out to build the
Administrative Order and execute the Divine Plan, was clear and straightforward. It
called for individual believers to arise, go to specific localities unopened to the Faith,
establish themselves as pioneers, teach, and gradually gather together in each locality a
group of believers able to form a Local Spiritual Assembly. Geographic spread was
clearly a fundamental concern. The number of believers remained relatively small, as did
the size of a typical local Bahá’í community. This pattern of growth was extremely
successful and led to the eagerly awaited election of the Universal House of Justice in
1963. Still effective, this pattern will probably continue to be instrumental in establishing
the Faith in many localities throughout the world.

But already during the Guardian’s lifetime, another pattern was starting to emerge. As a
result of the efforts of a few far-sighted individuals who set out to reach the indigenous
populations in countries like Uganda and Indonesia, enrollments into the Faith
accelerated dramatically. As you can imagine, this development brought great joy to
Shoghi Effendi’s heart, and the subsequent plans of the Universal House of Justice,
beginning with the Nine Year Plan in 1964, encouraged this mode of expansion. Century
of Light, the historical account of the twentieth century that was prepared under the
supervision of the House of Justice, explains the expansion of the Faith among the
masses of humanity in these terms:

       As believers from urban centers set out on sustained campaigns to reach the mass
   of the world’s peoples living in villages and rural areas, they encountered a
   receptivity to Bahá’u’lláh’s message far beyond anything they had imagined possible.
   While the response usually took forms very different from the ones with which the
   teachers had been familiar, the new declarants were eagerly welcomed. Tens of
   thousands of new Bahá’ís poured into the Cause throughout Africa, Asia and Latin
   America, often representing the greater part of whole rural villages. The 1960s and
   1970s were heady days for a Bahá’í community most of whose growth outside of Iran
   had been slow and measured.

Those of us who became familiar with large-scale expansion during that period remember
the excitement of those days. Receptivity and possibilities for growth were beyond our
imagination. We plunged into the teaching work and made every effort to make entry by
troops a sustainable reality. But as you know, it proved difficult to adequately face the
challenges brought about by the burst of enrollments. The process of expansion raced far
ahead of consolidation, despite the efforts of many committed believers to deepen the
newly enrolled friends and foster community life. As a result, growth could not be
sustained, enrollments dwindled, and the masses who had entered the Faith with such
enthusiasm became increasingly inaccessible.

In the years that followed, the Bahá’í community as a whole strove to understand the
dynamics of sustainable large-scale expansion and consolidation. “During these years,”
Century of Light tells us, “there was virtually no type of teaching activity, no combination
of expansion, consolidation and proclamation, no administrative option, no effort at
cultural adaptation that was not being energetically tried in some part of the Bahá’í
world. The net result of the experience was an intensive education of a great part of the
Bahá’í community in the implications of the mass teaching work, an education that could
have occurred in no other way.”

Then, on the 26 December 1995, in its message to the Conference of the Continental
Boards of Counsellors announcing the features of the Four Year Plan, we were called by
the Universal House of Justice to focus exclusively on the aim of advancing the process
of entry by troops. Two concepts were specially emphasized and have been repeatedly
woven into the messages of the House of Justice regarding the global plans ever since:
systematization and learning. If large-scale growth is to be realized and sustained, the
House of Justice has been telling us, we will need to work in a learning mode and act
systematically.

The first lesson the House of Justice brought to our attention at the inception of the Four
Year Plan had to do with the role of human resource development in advancing the
process of entry by troops. From all the experience leading up to that Plan, it had become
clear that this process could only be sustained if, as expansion accelerated, a certain
percentage of the believers were trained to perform the acts of service required by the
process. You are well familiar with this passage from the 26 December 1995 message:

       With the growth in the number of enrolments, it has become apparent that such
   occasional courses of instruction and the informal activities of community life,
   though important, are not sufficient as a means of human resource development, for
   they have resulted in only a relatively small band of active supporters of the Cause.
   These believers, no matter how dedicated, no matter how willing to make sacrifices,
   cannot attend to the needs of hundreds, much less thousands, of fledgling local
   communities. Systematic attention has to be given by Bahá’í institutions to training a
   significant number of believers and assisting them in serving the Cause according to
   their God-given talents and capacities.

With the launch of the Four Year Plan, then, the worldwide Bahá’í community embarked
on an unprecedented educational endeavor. Later, in a letter dated 31 May 2001
addressed to an individual believer, the nature of this collective endeavor was brought
into sharp focus.

        The aim of the Five Year Plan, and indeed of the Plan before it and the ones that
   lie immediately ahead, is to advance the process of entry by troops. In its message of
   26 December 1995 to the Conference of the Continental Boards of Counsellors, the
   House of Justice clearly explained that occasional courses of instruction and the
   informal activities of community life, though important, had not proven sufficient as a
   means of human resource development. It indicated further that a systematic process
   for the development of human resources was essential to the sustained large-scale
   expansion of the Faith. To conceive and nurture an educational process of the
   magnitude envisioned by the Universal House of Justice is vastly different than
   thinking about one’s own interests, which is not to say that personal study and
   spiritual growth are not legitimate and natural concerns of the individual.

We know that the educational process envisioned by the House of Justice was intended to
lead to “marked progress in the activity and development of the individual believer, of
the institutions, and of the local community.” The House of Justice has referred to these
three as “inseparable participants in the evolution of the new World Order”. If we accept
that the philosophical, ideological, cultural and historical context of our collective
educational endeavors are to be found in the unfoldment of the Divine Plan, then as we
reflect on the nature of the educational process on which the Bahá’í world embarked
some eight years ago, we must ask ourselves: What does it mean to build the capacity of
these three participants in the Plan to assume their proper functions and contribute
effectively to the advancement of entry by troops? This is the question to which I would
now like to turn.

There are numerous passages in the Writings and in the guidance from the Universal
House of Justice that give us a picture of how these three protagonists of the Plan are to
functions and interact. “The power to act”, we are reminded by the Universal House of
Justice “resides primarily in the entire body of the believers. This power is unlocked at
the level of individual initiative and at the level of collective volition.” “The role of the
individual,” we are further told, “is of unique importance in the work of the Cause. It is
the individual who manifests the vitality of faith upon which the success of the teaching

work and the development of the community depends. Bahá’u’lláh’s command to each
believer to teach His Faith confers an inescapable responsibility which cannot be
transferred to, or assumed by, any institution of the Cause. It is incumbent upon the
individual to seize opportunities, form friendships, build relationships, and win the
cooperation of others in common service to the Faith and society. The individual must
convert into action the decisions made by consultative bodies.”

As to the institutions, we are told by the House of Justice that, under its guidance,
“legislative, executive and judicial authority over the affairs of the Bahá’í community is
exercised by Local and National Spiritual Assemblies. This authority is also exercised by
Regional Councils, committees and other agencies established by these institutions, to the
extent that it is so delegated.” But in addition to the exercise of legislative, executive and
judicial authority, the institutions are to exert spiritual, moral and intellectual influence on
the lives of the believers. This influence acquires a special character through the services
performed by those individuals who are appointed to the high rank of Counsellors and by
their deputies. In relation to the vital task of unlocking the power to act at the level of
individual initiative and at the level of collective volition, we are specially advised that
“If the Cause is to realize Bahá’u’lláh’s purpose for humankind, every institution of the
Faith must be concerned with the release of power in both these expressions, as they are
with ensuring the wise administration of the community’s affairs. The institution of the
Counsellors is particularly charged with this vital task and is endowed with the capacity
to accomplish it.” Thus, we are reminded that:

       Acting in their respective roles, the two institutions of the Counselors and the
   Spiritual Assemblies share responsibility for the protection and propagation of the
   Faith. The harmonious interaction between them ensures the constant flow of
   guidance, love and encouragement to the believers and invigorates their individual
   and collective endeavors to advance the Cause.

About the third protagonist of the Plan, we know that, the community, as distinct from
the individual believer and the institutions, has its own life and dynamics. The
community is “more than the sum of its membership”, and it generates its own forces and
moves according to a common will. To quote the Ridván 1996 message: “…it is a
comprehensive unit of civilization composed of individuals, families and institutions that
are originators and encouragers of systems, agencies and organizations working together
with a common purpose for the welfare of people both within and beyond its own
borders.” Further: “It is a composition of diverse, interacting participants that are
achieving unity in an unremitting quest for spiritual and social progress.” What is
essential to remember is that the individual believer and institutions can only exist and
interact in an environment from which they can derive sustenance and to the enrichment
of which they can dedicate themselves. On the community, then, rests the challenge of
providing that environment where individual wills blend, where powers are multiplied
and manifest themselves in collective action, where higher expressions of the human
spirit can appear.

With these brief remarks on the nature and functions of the individual, the community
and the institutions, let us go back and ask the question again: What does capacity
building in the three protagonists of the Plan entail?

In the case of the individual, what should be clear from the passages I have quoted is the
absolute importance of initiative and action. Without the support of the individual, “at
once wholehearted, continuous and generous,” the Guardian explained, every measure
and plan of the National Spiritual Assembly is “foredoomed to failure” and the purpose
of the Master’s Divine Plan is “impeded”. Seen in this light, capacity building certainly
entails the enabling of the individual to manifest innate powers and God-given talents in a
creative and disciplined way, as he or she labors in the field of service and endeavors to
contribute to the progress of the global plans of the Faith.

Inherent in this definition is a particular understanding of what it means to exercise
individual initiative and participate in collective action. Individual initiative is not the
same as the pursuit of whatever the heart desires or random motion according to some
romantic definition of creativity. To be fruitful and avoid the alienation that results from
unrestricted individualism, creativity must accept discipline, and initiative must move in
the direction of oneness. Discipline needs to be maintained by the force of inner
conviction. When imposed, it succeeds only in quenching the fire of creativity. Yet, it
would also be misleading, in my estimation, to view inner discipline simply as a product
of the individual will. The human soul manifests its latent powers as it learns submission
to higher authority, fundamentally the authority of the spiritual and material laws that
govern existence. Understanding these laws penetrates individual conscience and gives
meaning to the authority bestowed on the institutions. “To labor in the arena of service,”
the Universal House of Justice has written, “the individual draws upon his love for
Bahá’u’lláh, the power of the Covenant, the dynamics of prayer, the inspiration and
education derived from regular study of the Holy Texts, and the transformative forces
that operate upon his soul as he strives to behave in accordance with the divine laws and
principles.”

To manifest innate powers in a creative and disciplined way, the believers need to gain
certain insights into spiritual matters, acquire some degree of knowledge of the Faith and
its teachings, and develop a range of skills that enable them to perform acts of service
effectively. These insights, knowledge, and skills will develop in them, to higher and
higher degrees, the many capabilities that participation in the Plan will require of them:
to build unity in diversity, to promote justice and look for ways to liberate victims of
oppression, to participate effectively in consultation, to oppose lower passions by turning
toward a higher purpose, to carry out their responsibilities with impeccable rectitude of
conduct, to face challenges with wisdom and determination, to make of obstacles
stepping stones for further progress, to encourage others and bring them joy. These are
but a few of the capabilities that the protagonists of our global plans must systematically
develop.

Building institutional capacity is, of course, intimately linked to the progress of the
individual. “The evolution of local and national Bahá’í Assemblies at this time,” the

House of Justice wrote in 1996, “calls for a new state of mind on the part of their
members as well as on the part of those who elect them… Bahá’u’lláh has given to the
world institutions to operate in an Order designed to canalize the forces of a new
civilization. Progress towards that glorious realization requires a great and continuous
expansion of the Bahá’í community, so that adequate scope is provided for the maturation
of these institutions.” And again: “A massive expansion of the Bahá’í community must
be achieved far beyond all past records. The task of spreading the Message to the
generality of mankind in villages, towns and cities must be rapidly extended. The need
for this is critical, for without it the laboriously erected agencies of the Administrative
Order will not be provided the scope to be able to develop and adequately demonstrate
their inherent capacity to minister to the crying needs of humanity in its hour of
deepening despair.”

In this context, then, institutions have to increasingly develop their capacity to exercise
authority and exert influence so that the powers of individuals and groups are
channelled towards the upliftment of humanity and the common good. Such capacity is
created as the institutions strive to foster the efforts of an ever-growing number of
friends in their individual and collective activities. That the development of capacity to
channel the believers’ energies applies equally to Assemblies and to the institution of
the Counsellors is clear from some of the passages I have quoted earlier.

An important aspect of building institutional capacity is to ensure that the exercise of
authority and influence is achieved not through the imposition of individual wills but in a
consultative environment. There is no need for me to discuss here the features of the
consultative process, which Bahá’u’lláh has given us as a means for the collective
investigation of reality and decision-making. We know, of course, that consultation
succeeds to the extent that every participant supports the decisions arrived at, regardless
of the opinions with which he or she entered the discussion. In the context of building
institutional capacity, this suggests the need for the development of a number of spiritual
qualities by the participants. Honesty, fairness, tolerance, patience, and courtesy are a
few that readily come to mind. To make a list of such attributes is not difficult. The
question is how to develop them. What force can enable people to oppose their passions,
to cling to truth even when it does not gratify some of their own perceived interests, and
to accept a discipline that invokes both courage in expressing frank opinions and wisdom
in becoming an active part of a consensus? This is a central question that a process of
capacity building in the individual and the institutions has to address.

As is the case with the individual believer, the capabilities required of a decision-making
body that is to discharge its sacred duties as a protagonist of the global plans of the Faith
are numerous. It must be able to consult freely and harmoniously as a body and with the
people it serves. It must realize that every decision has both a material and spiritual
dimension. It must be able to arrive at decisions; to win the confidence, respect and
genuine support of those affected by these decisions; and to implement decisions with an
openness and flexibility that avoid all trace of dictatorial behavior. Beyond this, it would
clearly need to develop the ability to maintain a clear perception of social reality and of
the forces operating in it; to detect some of the opportunities offered by each historical

moment; to properly assess the resources of the community; to effectively use the
energies and diverse talents of the available human resources; to integrate the diversity of
aspirations and of activities of individuals and groups into one forward movement; to
build and maintain unity; to uphold standards of justice. What this cursory list suggests is
a mode of governance that is entirely different from what humanity has ever experienced.
Its hallmark is its posture of learning.

As to the community, what we have said about the individual and institutions has
profound implications for the development of the community and hence for culture.
What are some of the characteristics of the culture that we are trying to create? “A
joyous and active life conducive to spiritual transformation and systematic growth,” “an
atmosphere of learning and disciplined behavior, characterized by patience and
forbearance toward mistakes,” “an environment free of excessive criticism, of backbiting,
of conflict and contention, which at the same time welcomes the expression of concern
on the part of every believer”—these are a few of the statements about the Bahá’í
community we find in the writings. A feeling of responsibility for its own spiritual well-
being needs to animate the community. It should be encouraged, through a consultative
process undertaken in the light of the Revelation, to reach its own vision of growth, arrive
at unity of thought, and devise plans of action which its members, themselves, are
capable of carrying out. The projects and activities resulting from such a consultative
process may, at first, need to be rather narrow in scope, but can become increasingly
complex as spiritual, social and economic development occurs.

These are some of the features of a process of capacity building in the three protagonists
of the Global Plans of the Bahá’í World Community. Tomorrow, we will look more
closely at this process as we discuss the training institute and the courses it presently
offers. In your smaller reflection meetings today you will be asked to examine the way
the capacity of your communities, particularly at the local and cluster levels, to act as
protagonists of the Five Year Plan has been enhanced in the past few years. Specific
examples you may be considering are the capacity to:

foster individual initiative within the framework of the Plan

direct the diverse talents of the friends to contribute to the aim of the Plan

I would like to bring this talk to an end by quoting some of the Guardian’s words about
the nature of the plans which we have said constitute the context in which our collective
educational endeavors are to take place. The Guardian told us that the Divine Plan is
“impelled by forces beyond our power to predict or appraise” and is “gaining momentum
with every passing day”. We know that our success at each stage of the Plan prepares us
as a community to embark on the global plan that will mark the next stage of this mighty
enterprise. But we should never forget that each stage brings us closer to that long-
awaited moment in history, which the Guardian has described in these terms: the “final
and crowning stage in the evolution of the Plan wrought by God Himself for humanity
will, in turn, prove to be the signal for the birth of a world civilization, incomparable in
its range, its character and potency, in the history of mankind—a civilization which
posterity will, with one voice, acclaim as the fairest fruit of the Golden Age of the
Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh.”
