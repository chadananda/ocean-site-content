BAHA'U'LLAH'S GROUND PLAN OF
WORLD FELLOWSHIP*
George Townshend

World Congress of Faith, 1936, London
Thursday, July 16th Morning Session

The Ground Plan of World Fellowship which is now submitted to your
consideration was composed out of the writings of Baha'uTlah and
presented by 'Abdu'1-Bahá in London, and later in Paris, about a quarter
of a century ago. It proposes in the simplest possible form a practical
scheme for mastering the urgent problem of world-fellowship; and its
originating idea, though of outstanding magnitude, is such as to place the
whole plan throughout, from its beginning, in complete accord with the
purpose we have before us today - that of promoting the spirit of
fellowship through the inspiration of religion.

This Plan, in every feature, plainly implies that nothing less than a
concerted effort on a world scale, with the spiritual energies of mankind
informing its practical energies, will now suffice to awaken the spirit of
fellowship and secure deliverance from danger. No local or regional
effort; no partial effort of either religion alone or statecraft alone, will
completely solve our problems. The sense of fellowship, to be adequate
to this unique emergency, must, on the one hand, be broad-based on the
whole of our human nature, spiritual, moral and intellectual, and on the
other hand must not be limited by any terrestrial boundaries whatever.

Conference, published by J. M. Watkins, 21 Cecil Court, London, W. C. 2, 1936, pp.

Such a thesis may still be ahead of the public opinion of mankind. But it
is not so far ahead of that opinion as it was when it was first proposed in
this city in 1911. Today our emergency is rather more serious than then;
but it is of the same general character. What, then, and up to the present,
has been lacking in men's experiments is clearness of spiritual vision, the
guidance of intuition. Only Faith can point or see the way in such an
hour as this. Men question the love of a God who could let loose on them
so dire a cataclysm and could choose out this generation for suffering
wholly unprecedented. Their doubt cuts them off from the source of light
and help. There is no vision; and the people perish. Only Faith sees
clearly, in open view, that this darkness is cast by a great light, that this
passing defeat of the spirit of Fellowship is the prelude of its final
victory. A loving God would not have set this generation problems
without bestowing the ability to solve them, would not inflict dire
penalties on those whom he regarded as guiltless.

We are daunted by the strange new troubles that close us in on every
side; we do not look within and observe that a new power of mastering
these is being developed in conscience and in spirit. Intellectual vision
never was so keen as in this generation; but spiritual vision, was it ever
more weak? We talk, we boast, of the New Age, but we miss its greatest
gift. We say the human race is at last reaching maturity, but we do not
realise the fullness, the completeness, of this growth. We perceive it is
intellectual; we do not perceive that it is, in like measure, moral and
spiritual. Man's conscience has become more sensitive, his spirit more
responsive to heavenly promptings. As he is today endowed with a new
degree of intellectual power, so also is he endowed today with a new
degree of religious power. The evolutionary process, with even hand,
bears onward the whole being and nature of man; his heart as well as his
brain. New ideals, new hopes, new dreams of further progress, a more
general, more insistent desire to build a better world than the one which
we inherit, these bear witness to man's consciousness of growth. In all its
faculties the human race is passing from childhood and ignorance
towards maturity; towards the tasks that befit full manhood. Today
mankind is like a youth leaving school for the sterner world of business
and affairs. It is called on to put into practice the lessons of moral
principle and human fellowship in which it has been instructed for so
long. For how many centuries have we, all of us, been under tutelage to
those whom we revere as the Founders of our Faiths? Is it strange that a
time should come when we should be required to put into concrete deeds

           Báká 'u 'Hák 's Ground Plan of World Fellowship                 195

the precepts of brotherhood we all acknowledge, and should at last be
threatened with condign punishment if we disobey?

Much, indeed, has been done of late to remedy old wrongs, to suppress
tyranny, to uplift the oppressed, to relieve the poor, to teach the ignorant.
But how much remains undone! We have accomplished enough to
convict ourselves of being fitted for a better social order, of being ready
to inaugurate a system of widespread justice and fraternity, and of
lacking the resolution to put our ideals into effect. There is enough of
good in our recent record to incriminate us, but not enough to deliver us.
We stand now before the judgment seat of heaven condemned by the
evidence of our own acts.

We had no vision. Men turned from the saints, mystics and seers, and
listened to secular philosophers. Blind leaders of the blind, into what
perdition have they led us! Our intellectual eminence by some fatality
heightened our troubles. Divorced from faith, it aggravated human pride,
taught men to forget their moral responsibility and to deny their
servitude before the moral law. The inevitable hour of retribution draws
near.

Surely this is a love-tragedy vaster in its scale, more terrible in its
poignancy than any in the history of our race!

The urge of evolution pressed us forward; we would not go. The spirit of
fellowship grew warm in our hearts; we would not feed its flame. The
gates of world-brotherhood opened wide; we turned away. God poured
His spiritual bounties on spirit and conscience in greater abundance than
ever; we in our blindness rejected His gifts and Him.

But this failure is not final nor for long. It is not the failure of Faith, nor
yet of Love. It is the open, the confessed failure of human wisdom.
Through its purgation men who have doubted will learn to turn for
fellowship and peace to the way they have not trodden; the way of
religion. But all must tread this way together. Since the whole world as a
unit is involved, the ideals which are to guide this movement must be
given a definite shape. If there is to be conceited action towards a single
goal, some map of the common journey must be made. Vague sentiments
of goodwill, however genuine, will not suffice. Some explicit agreement
on principles will be required for any co-ordinated progress.

It was to this task that Baha'uTlah long ago addressed himself, and
worked out a Ground Plan on which the temple of human fellowship
might be reared. It consisted of a set of fundamental principles and
represented the minimum of what the occasion required. No foundation
less deeply dug than this will hold the structure that is to be built upon it.

The burden of the whole scheme was laid ultimately upon the shoulders
of each individual man and woman. Everybody by virtue of his status as
a human being had his share in the vast world enterprise. The principle
of individual responsibility was thus to be the basis of all progress.

But underneath this basic fact of human duty lay something deeper yet.
The living rock on which this foundation was to be laid was something
the strength of which humanity hitherto has too little recognised. That
rock is the Truth. This spirit of fellowship which we seek to encourage is
not by Bahá'u!lláh conceived as some addition to being, which the genius
of man should undertake to create. As a flower within the bud, it lies
waiting the hour of its appearance. It is a reality which our
fragmentariness denies. And what this Assembly desires to do is not to
create something new, but to give expression to something which is
already in existence though unused. Man's advancing power is due to his
increasing knowledge of truth; and the magnificence of this present age
bears witness in the last resort not to the personal greatness of this
generation, but rather to the greatness of a continuously unfolding Truth.
If this Age is to become the Age of Universal Brotherhood, it must be
the Age of Knowledge, knowledge of Truth. The Truth will set us free.
The Truth will make us one.

As the first item of his programme, therefore, Baha'uTlah claimed that
every individual should have the right of seeking for himself the truth.
Love of truth, which at the present time is growing apace among
mankind, is the sole real corrective of all forms of error and illusion. The
great enmities which in the past have divided mankind, and which were
due to misunderstanding and ignorance, have, in recent times, lost their
vitality, and our estrangements are now due chiefly to the instinct of
imitation and to prejudice. These prejudices have come down to us from
the past, racial, religious, national. For them all Baha'uTlah offers one
radical cure, the search for truth. The battle which mankind yet has to
fight between prejudice and truth he seems to regard as the Armageddon
of the human soul.
Through this search for truth mankind at last would become really and
clearly conscious of the essential unity of the human race. For this unity
is, and has ever been, a fact. "Ye are the branches of one tree, and the
leaves of one branch. Deal ye with one another with the utmost love and
harmony, with friendliness and fellowship", wrote Baha'uTlah. From the
full knowledge of this unity, and from nothing less, there would be born
in this age a spirit of world fellowship adequate to the present
emergency. On this consciousness of unity, therefore, 'AbduT-Bahá laid
the greatest stress. He gave to it a central place in his programme, other
features supporting or amplifying it or giving it application in the
practical affairs of mankind.

One of the facts which has obscured from men's view their essential
unity is the difference between the world religions, which has been made
the cause of estrangement, or prejudice and even of ill-will and strife.
But, insisted 'AbduT-Bahá, there is nothing in these differences which
should produce so sad a result. Indeed, there is an important aspect in
which all religions are at heart one, and he included the existence of this
unity as a principle in his scheme. He meant, so it seems, that a religion
does not consist solely of a doctrine, and an institution, but is also, in a
real and vital sense a spiritual atmosphere. It is, as he once described it,
"an attitude of soul towards God, reflected in life." This is the essence of
true religion; and to this extent, the whole world over, members of all the
religions have an outlook, an experience, an obligation which they share
in common with one another in spite of their special and distinctive
loyalties, and which group them all together apart from the sceptic.

The more intensely spiritual men are, the more vividly conscious are
they of the reality and sweetness of this communion, and one of their
privileges is the experience of a deep sympathy, a common lowliness, a
common aspiration which they share with those of a different tradition
from their own.

Not only in their atmosphere and their influence but even in their
profounder teachings the world-religions may show forth this unity. Do
not all our faiths affirm and magnify the love of God for His creatures?
What truth could be more ancient, more precious than this? What would
bind those who espouse it with a closer tie of fellowship?

This age of widening consciousness and deepening love of truth has
begun to bring us, on a scale quite unprecedented, some accurate
knowledge of the sacred treasures and the sacred history of the human
race. Scholars, divines, men of letters, poets have all contributed to this
enlightenment. They show us each of the great religions as being like a
majestic temple reared in some chosen spot by the hand of a master
architect, and surrounded now by a multitude of lesser buildings of
various later dates. Each temple blends with its own environment but is
in marked contrast with all the other temples. No two are alike, and the
annexes connected with each are still more unlike. But if the enquiring
traveller pursues his investigations and makes his way within the sacred
structures, he discovers, in their several interiors and even in the shrines
themselves an unmistakable kinship in beauty.

Experts in comparative religion have spoken with emphasis of the points
of agreement to be found between the world religions. Professor Cheyne
quotes Max Muller as "advising the Brahmists to call themselves
Christians," and himself argues that the reconciliation of religions must
precede that of races "which at present is so lamentably incomplete."
The evidence of men of learning is supported by that of another cloud of
witnesses, whose testimony none can gainsay, and who speak with the
voice not of intellectual criticism but of spiritual knowledge. The highest
exponents of a religion, those who understand most thoroughly its
meaning and interpret its spirit with the most compelling authority, are
those men and women of mystical genius whose impassioned devotion
and obedience to their divine Master is the outstanding feature of their
lives. If each of these religions were strictly exclusive, the negation of all
the others, bringing to men its own irreconcilable message, those who
followed these religions to the extreme, the mystics and the saints, would
assuredly move farther and farther apart, and would come to rest at the
last point of divergence. The greater the saint the wider the gulf between
him and the saints of alien allegiances. At the same time the less aspiring
and spiritually gifted multitudes, immersed in the daily human concerns
which all men share alike, would be found to be the least estranged from
one another by their differing creeds.

But in fact this is not so. Strangely, very strangely, religious history
shows us something quite different, exactly the opposite. The contrast
between each world-religion and all its sister-religions is, as a rule, felt
most acutely and insisted on most vigorously by the less mystically

           Bahá fU 'lláh 's Ground Plan of World Fellowship             199

minded of its votaries. While the mystics of all the religions, instead of
moving farther and ever farther apart, seem rather to travel by
converging paths and to draw nearer and nearer together.

If one is to accept the account of their experience given by
contemporaries or by themselves, these mystics seem all the world over
to have gone upon the same spiritual adventure, to be drawn onward by
the same experience of an outpoured heavenly love; and they testify one
and all that to reach this knowledge of the love of God is to understand at
last the mystery and the hidden blessedness of life, and to possess an
everlasting treasure for which the sacrifice of all earthly things is but a
little price.

This fellowship among all mystics is common knowledge, of which
evidence is within the reach of all. In a well-known English work, Miss
Underhill writes of the mystics that, "We meet these persons in the east
and the west, in the ancient, medieval, and modern worlds. Their one
passion appears to be the prosecution of a certain spiritual and intangible
quest... This, for them, has constituted the whole meaning of life... and it
is an indirect testimony to its objective actuality that whatever the place
or period in which they have arisen, their aims, doctrines and methods
have been substantially the same. Their experience, therefore, forms a
body of evidence, curiously self-consistent and often mutually
explanatory..." (Introduction to Mysticism, Chapter I)

Every public library in this country will contain books supplying
illustrations of this statement. The mystical outlook and perspective both
on the things of heaven and the things of earth is in its essence eternally
the same. But perhaps no instance of the fundamental unity that underlies
all mystical experience is more striking than that parallelism between
Plotinus and St. Augustine to which in his Evolution of Theology
Professor Edward Caird draws attention. "Some of the finest expressions
of this (the mystical) attitude of soul," he writes, "may be found in the
Confessions of St. Augustine. But when St. Augustine expresses his
deepest religious feelings we find that he repeats the thoughts and almost
the very words of Plotinus." Professor Caird then shows how closely
akin to the thought of Plotinus is "that great passage in which Augustine
gives an account of his last conversation with his mother Monica about
the life of the redeemed in heaven." And he concludes, "how deeply neo-
Platonism must have sunk into the spirit of St. Augustine, when, in
describing the highest moment of his religious experience, he adopts
almost verbally the language in which Plotinus tries to depict the mystic
ecstasy of the individual soul as it enters into communion with the soul
of the world."

By what diverse paths have mystics, who had nothing in common save
wholehearted servitude before the one loving God, by what diverse paths
have they all alike attained the blessed Presence? And what man in his
pride of opinion will shut out from Paradise those whom God's own hand
has admitted? Thus do scholars and saints join to testify that the great
religions have their aspect of unity as well as their aspect of variety, and
that without qualifying their special allegiance, worshippers in all
religions may find something in the fundamental nature of religion itself
which promotes a sweet, precious and abiding sense of true
companionship.

The promotion of a boundless spirit of concord and goodwill,
Baha'uTlah maintained to be agreeable to the genius of every world-
religion. Whatever misunderstanding may have arisen in bygone
centuries, no religion as originally taught was meant to encourage
animosity. Quite the contrary. Religion is meant to heal discord. So
important, in an age of disintegration, did this feature of religion seem
that 'AbduT-Bahá proposed to include in his Plan the precept that, "the
purpose of religion is to promote harmony and affection."

One will not doubt this loving purpose may be discovered, or
rediscovered, in every one of our world-faiths, and assuredly in
Christianity. If we look away from Christendom to Christ and to the pure
teaching of Christ, we find it evident throughout the Gospels. Christ said
that one's whole duty was to love God and one's neighbour, and He
described neighbour as meaning anyone you could help regardless of
creed or kin. He made fellowship in love the evidence of Christian
membership, "By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples if ye
have love one to another."

In this Age we congratulate ourselves that for centuries past religious
enmity has been continually growing more weak. Yet our ideal remains
negative. To manifest no ill will towards those who differ in opinion from
us is not enough. Christ enjoined a more positive attitude of soul, one of
active goodwill despite all differences. When God thus commands a

          Bahá yu 'lláh 's Ground Plan of World Fellowship             201

spirit of affection towards all, He gives the power to obey His command.
Religion, in other words, is creative. Through its force the will of an
earnest man is enabled to achieve an inward change that otherwise would
be beyond his strength. If this were not so, what useful place would
religion fill in this kosmos of ours?

If now the creative power of religion to effect this purpose   were called
upon and put to vigorous use, how many vital problems          which have
proved insoluble on the intellectual plane, such as the        reunion of
Christendom or the combating of secularism, might prove        much more
tractable when carried to the spiritual plane!

Another effort at harmonisation was called for when Baha'uTlah
included in this scheme an active partnership between religion and
science.

Tolerance between the two is too little. In their nature they are
complementary, as two wings with which the soul soars towards
knowledge of the truth. Science divorced from religion gives a wholly
distorted view of reality. Religion divorced from science may become a
mere superstition. Man is to use both as his servants and thus to bring the
material aspect of life and the spiritual aspect at last into evident and
complete accord.

To these principles Baha'u'llah added, as necessary for practical results,
certain provisions of a more material nature. 'Abdu'1-Bahá mentioned
laws to prevent extremes of indigence and opulence, universal education,
a common language, a central World-Tribunal.

To the use by all nations of a secondary or world language in addition to
their mother tongue, great importance was attached. Without this device
fellowship would never be assured. The religious history of mankind
from the days of Babel to the present bears out this emphasis. When we
remember, for example, the influence of the general use of the Greek
language throughout the Roman Empire at the beginning or our Era;
when we consider how in Islam the adoption of Arabic as a common
language united peoples hitherto estranged, facilitated the interchange of
thought and aided the rapid extension of a single culture over vast
regions; or when again we observe how the cause of ecclestiastic unity
was promoted by the use, and weakened by the disuse, of the Latin

language as a medium among the peoples of western Europe centuries
ago; we are driven to conclude that in this age of radio and aviation a
world-language would unify the peoples of mankind to a degree
unprecedented in the past and difficult for us to calculate in anticipation.

The federal tribunal or Board of Arbitration which in a few words
'Abdu'1-Bahá proposed, differed in three notable points from the League
which afterwards was set up. The provision of an adequate police force
was an essential prerequisite: the draft of any proposed constitution was
to be referred not only to the governments but also to the peoples of the
world; and, when finally ratified and adopted, it was to enjoy the full
support of religion, of church as well as of state, and its strict
maintenance against any violation by any nation was to be held by all
mankind as a sacred obligation.

In these and all other reforms man's greatest stay would be the Holy
Spirit, without whose aid no peace or fellowship or unification would
ever be secured.

This scheme of world fellowship, first promulgated some forty years
before, was presented twenty-five years ago in London by 'Abdu'1-Bahá.
"This," he said, "is a short summary of the teachings of Baha'u'llah. To
establish this, Baha'u'llah underwent great difficulties and hardships. He
was in constant confinement and he suffered great persecution. But...
from the darkness of his prison he sent out a great light into the world."
('Abdu'1-Bahá in London, p. 18)

'AbduT-Bahá claimed that these principles were consistent with the
spirit of all the world-religions, and were measured with exact and
unique fitness to mankind's heightened capacity and its tremendous
responsibility at this time. He felt no doubt of this being at no very
distant date adopted: fellowship along these lines was the birthright of
our New Age. But though they have percolated far through the world and
have cheered the hearts of many, yet the larger collaboration between
races and religions here so definitely outlined has in fact been postponed
in favour of narrower views and more materialistic reforms. Our
civilisation is in desperate plight and has sunk into a moral and spiritual
abyss.

          Bahá 'u 'lláh 9s Ground Plan of World Fellowship           203

Men realise the urgent need of a reformation greater in range and
intensity than mankind has ever yet achieved; but know not how to meet
that need.

In such an emergency does not this bold original scheme of fellowship
merit serious consideration and even the test of experiment? Does it
deserve to be merely ignored by the rulers and teachers of the world?

In advocating peace to a western audience 'Abdu'1-Bahá once said: "You
have had war for thousands of years; why not try peace for a change? If
you do not like it you can always go back to war." One might hazard a
similar suggestion about this fellowship plan. We have tried every other
device, why not now try this?

For all its brevity, this summary may suffice to suggest the character of
the Ground Plan of World Fellowship constructed by Bahá'u'lláh and
presented here in London by 'Abdu'1-Bahá, and may indicate how close
it is in spirit and in purpose to the ideal which is now before this
Assembly.

If it be true that reforms as great and as numerous as these are demanded
by the Genius of our Age, one will perceive why the alternatives tried by
mundane wisdom during this generation have resulted in consistent
disappointment. What has been lacking in all is religious insight, an
appreciation of the fact that evolution has brought to men an advance in
their moral and spiritual powers and a proportionate heightening of their
opportunities and responsibilities.

"That one is a man indeed who to-day dedicateth himself to the service
of the entire human race... It is not for him to pride himself who loveth
his own country, but rather for him who loveth the whole world. The
earth is but one country and mankind its citizens." (Gleanings from
Baha'uTlah, p.250)

Baha'uTlah clearly affirms that without a keener spirituality, a loftier
and firmer faith in the Universal Father mankind will not discover the
way out of its troubles. Only through the initiative of religion will
humanity be rescued from dissention and united in hearts' fellowship.
And if religiously minded men and women are to leaven with the spirit
of fellowship this love-lorn and lonely world until the whole be

leavened, that which they will need beyond all else is that they have in
their hearts no place where doubt or fear may enter but be possessed with
the invincible assurance that under God the whole movement of
evolution is with us in this endeavour, that no difficulty, no delay, no
defeat which may take shape as we advance can ever stem the onward
march of Heaven's purpose, that within man's soul to-day are ample
powers to win all that we desire, and that the banner under which
mankind will stand at last united is that spiritual faith in the love of
Almighty God, which is the universal heritage of us all.

Comments by the Chairman, Viscount Sir Herbert Samuel:

If one were compelled to choose which of the many religious
communities of the world was closest to the aim and purpose of this
Congress, I think one would be obliged to say that it was the
comparatively little known Baha'i community.

Other faiths and creeds have to consider at a Congress like this, in what
way they can contribute to the idea of world fellowship. But the Baha'i
faith exists almost for the sole purpose of contributing to the fellowship
and the unity of mankind.

Other communities may consider how far a particular element of their
respective faith may be regarded as similar to those of other
communities, but the Baha'i faith exists for the purpose of combining in
one synthesis all those elements in the various faiths which are held in
common. And that is why I suggest that this Baha'i community is really
more fully in agreement with the main idea which has led to the
summoning of the Congress than any particular one of the great religious
communities of the world.

Its origin was in Persia where a mystic prophet, who took the name of
the Bab, the "Gate," began a mission among the Persians in the earlier
part of the nineteenth century. He collected a considerable number of
adherents. His activities were regarded with apprehension by the
Government of Persia of that day. Finally, he and his leading disciples
were seized by the forces of the Persian Government and were shot in
the year 1850. In spite of the persecution, the movement spread in Persia
and in many of the countries of Islam. He was followed as the head of
the community by the one who has been its principal prophet and
exponent, Baha'u'llah. He was most active and despite persecution and
imprisonment made it his life's mission to spread the creed which he
claimed to have received by direct divine revelation. He died in 1892 and
was succeeded as the head of the community by his son, 'Abdu'1-Bahá,
who was born in 1844. He was living in Haifa, in a simple house, when I
went there as High Commissioner in 1920, and I had the privilege of one
or two most interesting conversations with him on the principles and
methods or the Baha'i faith. He died in 1921 and his obsequies were
attended by a great concourse of people. I had the honour of representing
His Majesty the King on that occasion.

Since that time, the Baha'i faith has secured the support of a very large
number of communities throughout the world. At the present time it is
estimated that there are about eight hundred Baha'i communities in
various countries. In the United States near Chicago, a great temple, now
approaching completion, has been erected by American adherents to the
faith, with assistance from elsewhere. Shoghi Effendi, the grandson of
'Abdu'1-Bahá, is now the head of the community. He came to England
and was educated at Balliol College, Oxford, but now lives at Haifa, and
is the centre of a community which has spread throughout the world.
