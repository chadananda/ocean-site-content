    The G uardiansh ip and th e Univer sal

House of Justic e *

Ian Semple

When, earlier today, I was recalling these past years, it
occurred to me how much the British Bahá’í Community has
grown in that short time. When I left in 1961 I recollect there
were about eight hundred Bahá’ís in the whole British Isles, and
they were already not only operating twenty five Local Spiritual
Assemblies, but directing the work in east and west Africa, and
starting to think about the Pacific, and all sorts of things. At
that time they were in fact about the size of a normal local
congregation of a Non-Conformist Church, but the Faith
obviously had much greater strength – as you see by the range of
activities that they were undertaking. Now just see the size of
the meeting here and think of all the other friends in the British
Isles. It is a tremendous advance.

What I have been asked to talk about tonight is the
Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice, which, in a
sense, is a brief outline of part of the history of the Faith. I
think history is vital for us to know and to understand but we
should also see ourselves as part of it. We cannot divide life
rigidly into the past, present and future. Academically, perhaps,
one has to. I remember when I was at university one of my
friends wanted to study the history of the First World War, but
he was told by his professor of history that he could not do
that, it just wasn’t history; it was current affairs.

Of course, really, current affairs is just a continuation of
history. This was brought home to me in 1962, when we were at
Bahjí commemorating the Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh. In those
days we would go out there in the evening and have a meal
together, and then we would spend the evening either dozing or
walking around or sitting, talking, and then we would probably
go to sleep for a while and, finally, in the morning hours gather
for the commemoration of the Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh. Well,
that particular night, while we were sitting around the table

364                       Guardianship and Universal House of Justice

where we had been eating, the Hand of the Cause Mr Samandarí,
who was there with us, told us 1how moved he was to be there
on that evening because it was the first time he had been in
Bahjí on the night of the Ascension since it took place. And we
realised he had been a pilgrim when Bahá’u’lláh ascended and
had been in the presence of Bahá’u’lláh. And here he was sitting
with us. That’s how short Bahá’í history is. This is just the year
162 – we are in the middle of the second century. We are not, in
Bahá’í terms, at the beginning of the 21st century; we are in the
second century. We are in the springtime of the world.

We remember this every Ridván when we think of the
declaration of Bahá’u’lláh. It also makes you think of the
relative youth of the Faith as you look at the developments that
have taken place in recent decades. We were recalling today the
visit of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the United Kingdom. I do not think
there are any Bahá’ís left here now that remember that visit but
there were when I first became a Bahá’í. It was when Shoghi
Effendi was here in London that he learnt of the death of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá and had to return to the Holy Land. He was a very
young man. A lot of the Bahá’ís now are youth; just think what
it meant to a young man of twenty four to suddenly find
himself in the position of the Guardian of the Cause of God,
appointed by his beloved grandfather ‘Abdul-Bahá. It was a
shattering experience for Shoghi Effendi. Think of yourself ...
what would you do if you suddenly were told “Look! Here is the
Cause of God for a thousand years. Look after it. Be the
Guardian of this Cause, protect it, teach it, build it.” That’s
what Shoghi Effendi faced. And he faced doing it with both
tremendous positive assets and tremendous liabilities.

Positively there were many, many deeply devoted Bahá’ís
around the world who rallied to him, who turned to him as
‘Abdu’l-Bahá had said, who just longed to do what he wanted;
to do what he showed them for the advancement of this Cause.
It wasn’t that they were starting from scratch – ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
had already been educating them. You had people like Martha
Root who went around the world. Read the letters between
Martha Root and Shoghi Effendi and see the profound love that
existed between them. One must remember how small the Bahá’í
world was in those days when Shoghi Effendi became the
Guardian. There was a very lovely relationship of profound
friendship that existed among true Bahá’ís in those days.

They were nevertheless human beings and they had their
struggles. I remember Hasan Balyuzi telling me about the early
community in England. He said that they were real, strong

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                   365

characters. They had to try to be Bahá’ís in those days. It wasn’t
easy for someone like Lady Blomfield to be a Bahá’í. They loved
one another, they would fight like cat and dog in a meeting, and
then go their ways, and then they had to come together again.
They had their strong ideas, and they had only just begun to
learn about the Faith. They hadn’t any of the letters of the
Guardian on which we so ardently rely – he had only just
become Guardian. They were strong characters, but they fought
for the Cause, they loved the Cause and they clung together.
And this unity among the friends, the love among the friends,
and the idealism of the friends, their willingness to go out and
sacrifice themselves was what enabled the Guardian to build so
much.

But we shouldn’t think it was easy for Shoghi Effendi. He
was faced with the most tremendous obstacles in the very early
years of his Guardianship. Some of the most prominent Bahá’ís
turned against him. Avareh, who was an outstanding teacher of
the Faith in Iran, thought he could tell the Guardian how to run
the Cause of God. Ahmad Sohrab, who had been the secretary of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, didn’t like the idea of the Administrative Order
and did all he could to undermine it. If you read nowadays some
of the things that Ahmad Sohrab wrote, they might sound very
reasonable. But you need to know how he sometimes showed his
“reasonableness” in the way he mistranslated some of ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá’s talks. Sometimes when ‘Abdu’l-Bahá would talk about
the fear of God, Ahmad Sohrab would think this wasn’t the
thing people wanted to hear and translated it as the love of
God. To think one knows better that the Centre of the Cause is
the beginning of a slippery slope.

The Guardian had to face such issues, and right at the heart
of the problems he had with his family was one Bahá’í called
Nayir Afnán. He had been accepted back into the Faith after
having broken the Covenant and was there in the family, a
descendant of Bahá’u’lláh. There is a story I was told – by
Hassan Sabri, I think - about a Bahá’í who was on pilgrimage
shortly after Shoghi Effendi became the Guardian and went to
Bahjí. In Bahjí he was met by Nayir Afnán who lived in a little
house which is now between the Shrine and the Pilgrim House.
In conversation, Nayir said Shoghi Effendi was impatient and
was a very difficult person to work for, but of course he had
been appointed in the Will and Testament of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and
they naturally had to obey. It horrified the pilgrim that someone
would speak this way about the Guardian. When he returned to
Haifa, Shoghi Effendi asked if he had visited Bahjí and he said

366                      Guardianship and Universal House of Justice

“Yes”, and he asked if he had seen anybody there and the pilgrim
said “Yes, Nayir Afnán” and when Shoghi Effendi asked if Nayir
had said anything the pilgrim just couldn’t bring himself to
repeat the conversation and said “Oh, nothing in particular”.
Later that night he thought to himself, “What have I done?. The
Guardian asked me whether Nayir said anything and I didn’t tell
him!” So the next morning he was up at the crack of dawn to see
the Guardian and he recounted what Nayir had said, and the
Guardian said to him: “We must be grateful that he accepts the
Will and Testament. What he said about me doesn’t matter.”

Then, later, the Guardian’s sister, against his will, married
Nayir Afnán and Nayir Afnán gradually poisoned the whole
family against the Guardian. Rúhíyyih Khánum recalled how,
shortly after she was married, the Guardian would sit with the
members of his family and say, “This Nayir, this Nayir, this
Nayir, he will destroy you all! Send him away!”. And they
wouldn’t. And that is what happened: Nayir Afnán poisoned the
minds of members of Shoghi Effendi’s family against him, and
caused them all to break the Covenant.

I mention this now because it is the background against
which you can see what Shoghi Effendi achieved. When you read
those marvellous letters that he wrote to the west, Bahá’í
Administration, the World Order letters, his letters encouraging
the friends, all this outpouring of enthusiasm, of guidance, of
love was made against a background of barbs and criticism, and
problems caused for him by some of those who were closest to
him. I mention this at the beginning because you should
understand it, but this is not the totality of his problems. For
example, shortly after he became Guardian the followers of
Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí stole the keys of the Shrine of
Bahá’u’lláh. Here was this young man facing such a crisis. He
eventually got them back, but remember that these were the
sorts of things he was dealing with when you look at what he
was doing for the whole Bahá’í world. He wrote these fantastic
letters, these marvellous letters, and it’s good to read them
through. Don’t just dip into them. Get Bahá’í Administration
and The Advent of Divine Justice and the World Order letters
and read them through, it may take quite a while, but you’ll see
the unfolding of his ideas.

The Hand of the Cause Leroy Ioas used to relate that the
Guardian had once said to him: “Leroy, did you think that, when
I became Guardian I had this whole pattern of the
Administrative Order laid out before me and I then began to
gradually unfold it to the Bahá’ís?” And Leroy replied that,

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                   367

indeed, that was what he did think. The Guardian replied that it
was not at all like that, he just had to take one decision after
another. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had said he would be guided and he
trusted ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. So, when something needed to be decided,
Shoghi Effendi, having confidence in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s promise,
would decide it. He would know it was right. He would then
move on and the next stage would evolve. Moreover, he didn’t
hesitate to change his mind occasionally. This is where one has
to understand that the Manifestation of God and those that He
leaves at the centre of His Faith are sensible people.

In one case, the Guardian had appointed as a goal of the plan,
that a translation of Bahá’í literature was to be made into a
certain language, and the National Assembly responsible wrote
to him saying “We’ve looked to find this language but we have
been told it became extinct some time ago. What do we do?
Shoghi Effendi said that they should go ahead and translate into
such and such another language. He didn’t say “Oh dear, I’ve
made a mistake, I can’t be infallible.” He said, “choose that – it
doesn’t work? - OK choose another one!” He had the
combination of great wisdom, of great confidence and great
humility, and of great good common sense, and you can see this
comes out in all his writings. So I do ask you to make a point of
reading through his writings. You may say it is difficult English,
and in some ways it is, but that’s because it’s extremely good
English. He says things clearly. Take a sentence of the Guardian
and it seems to be a very long sentence but in fact it is a
contracted paragraph. He’s got so many ideas in it. And he used
to read and write aloud. Rúhíyyih Khánum said he liked to read
aloud when he was writing and sometimes this helps if you are
having difficulties with the Guardian’s writing. Read it aloud.
Because that’s how he wrote it, and you will see in this way how
it makes sense and how it links together. You may be able to
make sense without reading it aloud but, even so, it helps
sometimes because you see the points in the flow of his ideas.

During all these events, the Guardian gradually built up the
Bahá’í world. He started with constructing the Administrative
Order. Early on, he had wanted to call for the election of the
Universal House of Justice and in fact he gathered to Haifa a
number of prominent Bahá’ís from around the world to consult
about what could be done. But he came to the conclusion that it
couldn’t be done, it wasn’t the time; it was premature. First he
had to build the groundwork on which the House could rest. So
you see all these letters about the election of Local Assemblies,
how Assemblies function; the spirit that has to suffuse

368                        Guardianship and Universal House of Justice

consultation. And then the election of National Assemblies and
how National Assemblies function. All this business of
administrative functioning was essential to the Cause. Some
Bahá’ís criticised him and said “What about the Divine Plan of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá?” In fact this is what Ahmed Sohrab said, he said
“Why are you talking about all this administration when
‘Abdu’l-Bahá ’s Divine Plan is there. Why don’t you put it into
action?” The Guardian explained that he had to have
instruments for the work.

Martha Root was the greatest teacher we’ve known but very
little remained of what she did because there was nothing to
follow up her achievements. There was no structure, few local
communities or Local Spiritual Assemblies, let alone National
Assemblies, committees and so on. So this is how the Guardian
approached things, with the guidance of God. As he told Leroy,
he didn’t see it all it from the beginning but he saw what he had
to do at each stage, and he did it. In those early years he raised
up the structure of the Administration and then began to
implement the Divine Plan of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. He launched the
Bahá’ís on the series of great teaching plans: first of all, the first
Seven Year Plan when in the Western Hemisphere they had to
establish Assemblies in every state of the United States,
including Alaska, and every province of Canada, and establish a
centre in each republic of Latin America; then, in the second
Seven Year Plan, the teaching campaign to establish and
strengthen the Faith in ten countries of the then war-torn
continent of Europe

While the second Seven Year Plan was going on, Shoghi
Effendi encouraged various other countries to join in. In
Britain we had our Six Year Plan. That’s when I had the good
fortune to become a Bahá’í – towards the end of the Six Year
Plan, in 1950. At that time the community was just humming.
The pioneers had gone out all over the British Isles establishing
the Assemblies. These were very fragile institutions. The friends
had to keep re-pioneering to save the Assemblies. The National
Assembly would send out almost weekly bulletins as the end of
the plan approached: that there are two more gaps in this place,
three more there. And the friends would get up and pioneer, and
eventually the Six Year Plan was won. Just barely! With
tremendous effort, but it was a basis.

At each stage, the Guardian aroused the friends to establish a
foundation on which they could move forward. And the British
Bahá’ís had no sooner taken a deep breath, having accepted the
idea of completion of the Six Year Plan, when the Guardian

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                    369

opened their minds to the idea of the Africa campaign. It’s one
thing to pioneer from London to Belfast, or Dublin, or
somewhere like this, but to pioneer to Africa? And if you talk
to pioneers of the Ten Year Crusade, you will hear a number of
them hadn’t the faintest idea where they were going. Írán
Muhájir tells me that when she and Dr Muhájir were to pioneer
to Indonesia she had only the foggiest idea where Indonesia was,
let alone what it was like. But there they went. These pioneers
just arose and went out and scattered the Faith all over the
world. The Guardian used to talk often of the need for the
diffusion of the Faith first and then for the suffusion of the
Faith in all these territories. To spread it all over the world and
then, in all these countries, to increase the depth of the
understanding of the Faith. This is what has been going on all
this time.

Having got the plans going Shoghi Effendi was using his
administration to send the Faith out in the world. He continued
the building of the Administrative Order, and a great
astonishment to the Bahá’í world came in 1951 when he
appointed the first International Bahá’í Council. In those days,
remember, we had just learnt to use Local and National
Assemblies and suddenly here was an international institution
that he said was the embryo of the Universal House of Justice.
The very thought of the House of Justice had been way, away,
in the future, but now we were given, as it were, a foretaste,
and we saw something beginning to function. In the Holy Land,
of course, the effect was to give the Guardian some reliable
helpers at last. For a long time his helpers had been his brothers
and cousins and they were the ones who turned against him.
Then, of course, he had married Rúhíyyih Khánum, and she
became his secretary. There is a wonderful message2 he wrote
referring to her as “my helpmate, my shield in warding off the
darts of Covenant-breakers and my tireless collaborator in the
arduous tasks I shoulder.” This is really a whole other story but
I hope, if Violette Nakhjavání comes again to London, that she
can tell you more about Rúhíyyih Khánum, because she was the
most extraordinary woman, of tremendous character, great
love, great understanding and profound humility. She was the
Guardian’s right hand, helping him and writing his letters, and
again you see the smallness of the Bahá’í world at that period.
You read a letter from Rúhíyyih Khánum to the Secretary of the
National Assembly of the British Isles and it starts “Dear John”.
John Ferraby was secretary and Rúhíyyih Khánum calls him
“Dear John”. He called her Rúhíyyih Khánum of course, but
you can see there was this closeness and this love between the

370                       Guardianship and Universal House of Justice

friends. Now, with the appointment of the International Bahá’í
Council, we saw some friends being sent to Haifa.

In England we were all astonished when we got a message to
the National Spiritual Assembly to ask Luftullah Hakim to go to
Haifa for services. Luftullah Hakim was a descendant of I think
the earliest Jewish Bahá’í in the Faith and he had been
pioneering. He had served ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and he was pioneering
at this time in Edinburgh, and so he went to Haifa, we didn’t
know why. Then there were two elderly ladies who were in
America, the Revell sisters, devoted Bahá’ís; they were called
there too: Jessie and Ethel, and they were two wonderful souls,
small lovely ladies, sisters, but very different in character.

Rúhíyyih Khánum said once that there were two saints in
Haifa. One was Ethel Revell and the other was Alice Kidder.
Alice was a companion of Rúhíyyih Khánum at that time, a
kindly, gentle, patient soul, a qualified osteopath who helped
many of us who got strains or similar problems from time to
time. Ethel Revell was also a saint in every way. She had a very
wry sense of humour. She completed her work every day. When
she was given a job she would work at it until it was finished,
and then she would go to sleep even if it took till the early hours
of the morning. The next day was a new day and she started
again. When I was on pilgrimage I got up rather early to get
ready to leave, but Ethel Revell was up already, in the kitchen
beginning to get breakfast. One of her eyes didn’t work
properly with the other, it looked out a little bit and she tended
to hold her head on one side. And as I came into the kitchen she
looked at me and she said, with a twinkle in her eye: “The early
bird catches the worm. But who wants a worm anyway?” That
was typical of Ethel. Now Jessie was quite a different character,
a bulldog, she had the International Fund in her hands; in fact
she had it in a pink toffee tin. She kept it in her room and her
room was the only room in the building that had a Yale lock on
it because she had the fund in there. And she would bargain for
the benefit of the Faith. She was absolutely adamant in defence
of the Faith. So now these two sisters were there, in Haifa,
together with the other members appointed to the Council.

We had just got used to the idea of the Council being called
into being by the Guardian when, the following December, in
1951, he appointed the first living Hands of the Cause of God
during his ministry. Until then the only Hands we had ever
thought of or heard of, were from the times of Bahá’u’lláh and
‘Abdu’l-Bahá or the ones appointed posthumously, and clearly
they were the most outstanding people, but the idea of actually

Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                    371

having a Hand of the Cause in this world, whom you could meet
and talk to just never occurred to us. It was again something
for the future. Suddenly here were the Hands of the Cause
appointed by the Guardian. It was such a thrill for the Bahá’í
world. And I remember that one of the few I had met at the
time was Hermann Grossmann. And his character was so
outstanding that, once he was appointed, I thought “Oh yes,
that’s what a Hand is like”.

These Hands were appointed all around the world, and it was
only 1951. The Guardian had already started building the
Administrative Order at the base, and then got the National
Assemblies going, and then, suddenly, he started from the top
on the other arm of the Administration, so here was the
Guardian appointing his Hands. And they had been functioning
only a short time when he called on them to appoint the
Auxiliary Board Members. No one had even heard of the
Auxiliary Board members before – these helpers to the Hands
that the Hands themselves had to appoint. And some of the
Hands were asking the Guardian whom they should appoint, but
the Guardian replied that that was their job, He was appointing
them and they were to appoint their Auxiliary Board Members.
This whole concept was quite new and very difficult for some
Bahá’ís, because we had got out of the way of thinking of
certain Bahá’ís as being kingpins, we had got used to thinking of
institutions as the authoritative bodies and then suddenly to
have individuals who had rank and status and advisory authority
over Assemblies rather jangled the brains of the some of the
friends. They found it difficult to accept because we hadn’t got
used to the idea that the Administrative Order has two pillars,
and one of them is this pillar of appointed persons, the Hands
of the Cause and their Board members, doing certain functions
which are different from the sorts of functions we are used to
in other religions. They are not a clergy. They are very different.

The Guardian, in The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh, describes
these different elements of the Bahá’í Administration. That is
again another letter to read through very carefully. For example,
Shoghi Effendi includes the principle of democracy which is
evident in the method of election. There is the principle of the
monarchy which is in a sense the Guardian and his functions.
Then of course there is the quality of aristocracy. Now some
friends thought the Hands were the aristocrats, but that’s not
it. The principle of aristocracy appears in the responsibility of
Spiritual Assemblies and their members to decide what they
believe is right; not merely what they think the people would

want. Assemblies are responsible to consult the Bahá’ís, to find
out what the Bahá’ís think, to find out what they need. But their
responsibility is to God, to decide by their conscience what they
believe is right. Now this is what aristocracy means, “the rule of
the best”. It is the principle of our elective bodies. Thus the
principle of a Bahá’í election is for the believer to vote for the
best that he or she can. That does not mean that those elected
are going to be marvellous - we are all just human beings; but
that is the aristocratic principle, that we should elect people
who we think are the best available, not just those who we
expect to do what we want them to do. The sovereign is not the
people, the sovereign is God. This is the Kingdom of God on
earth, not the republic of God on earth. And when we elect our
Spiritual Assemblies we are electing those who we feel are best.
Whom we can consult, whom we can advise, but whom we will
obey. This is the aristocratic principle of the Faith, and it’s
interesting how the Hands followed the same pattern when the
Universal House of Justice came into being and they accepted
its authority. But I will come to that later.

The Guardian had been building all this, and had given us the
vision of the Ten Year Crusade, which we were pursuing, when
he suddenly passed away. This was a most tremendous blow to
the Bahá’í world. He was young, 60 years old, when he died and
we loved the Guardian so intensely. As I said, it was a small
world and there were many Bahá’ís who had met the Guardian.
One of the greatest blessings of my life is that I had the bounty
of doing so. He was such a considerate person, and full of
enthusiasm. He had majesty – you would never underestimate
the stature of the Guardian – but he was so loving. I was a
British pilgrim, and when he welcomed me the first thing he
started talking about was the weather; he knew British people
talked about the weather! That was an example of how he helped
pilgrims to feel at ease.

I learnt later from Rúhíyyih Khánum how he had solved a
problem in relation to the western pilgrims. I mention this
because it is an example of how the Guardian dealt with such
issues. The problem was this, that the pilgrims used to be
gathered in a room, and the Guardian would come in to meet
them, and, as you know, in western society ladies do not stand
up for men when they come into the room. So some of the
western ladies, when the Guardian came in, would continue
sitting and hold out their hand to be shaken and say “How do
you do Shoghi Effendi?” Shoghi Effendi couldn’t permit this to
continue. To start with, it was too terrible a test for the

oriental Bahá’ís who might witness it and he couldn’t allow that
to happen. But he didn’t issue an instruction that when the
Guardian comes in would everyone please stand up, including
the ladies. He so arranged it that in future he would be in the
room first. And then the pilgrims came in and so, of course,
they were standing up. (They didn’t come in sitting down!). And
then he could welcome them and show them to their seats. He
was a perfect host welcoming his guests. This is the sort of way
he solved problems. Nevertheless, he could be angry sometimes.
God knows, he often had sufficient reason to be angry. He
himself said he was not the exemplar of Bahá’í life. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá was that. Nevertheless, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá also could be angry
when necessary; and also Bahá’u’lláh Himself.

The degree of love reached its peak in the Manifestation of
God. Rúhíyyih Khánum told me that throughout her childhood
it had been ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to whom she had felt most close and,
when she married, she asked one of the members of the Holy
Family, whether Bahá’u’lláh was really as loving as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
was. And this member of the Holy Family said, “Oh, compared
with Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wasn’t loving at all!” So we get a
little glimpse of the degree of the qualities of the Manifestation
of God.

But, to get back to the Guardian, Rúhíyyih Khánum said that
when, on occasion, he was angry, you could feel the whole house
shake. But, of course, he usually wasn’t angry with the pilgrims.
He was so loving, so understanding, so interested in the
pilgrims, he could see the genuineness of character.

One of the things I was frightened about when I went on
pilgrimage was that I had a sneaking feeling that the Guardian
could see right through me. He would know what I was like.
And that is a very uncomfortable feeling in relation to anybody,
and if it’s the Guardian of the Cause of God, it is extremely
uncomfortable. The resolution of that worry was given to me in
getting a glimpse of the nature of the Guardian himself. I felt
that, indeed, he saw right through me, but I also realized that
although he really knew you, there was the consolation that the
flaws he just ignored. They were not what he was interested in.
What he concentrated on was any possibilities that he could do
something with. Any possibility for positive capacity he would
then encourage. Many pilgrims had this similar experience. He
had this positive effect on the friends, and aroused their great
love and affection. The friends loved him very, very dearly and
when he passed away it wasn’t only the loss of the Guardian that
we suffered, it was the loss of Shoghi Effendi himself

His funeral, as you know, was in London and Rúhíyyih
Khánum was here. She comforted the friends, and she rallied the
Hands and took them back to Haifa and we received the
wonderful message that the Hands sent out from their first
Conclave, and they took forward the whole Ten Year Crusade to
a vic1torious conclusion.

The Guardian had been very worried by the midpoint of the
Crusade that the impetus was dying down, the outflow of the
pioneers had lessened. And he spoke to two lots of pilgrims in
two different ways. He said something similar to several groups
of pilgrims, but to one group he said “I called on them to
pioneer and they wouldn’t go, I called upon them to disperse
and they wouldn’t go. They will leave as refugees.” To others he
said “I called on them to pioneer and they wouldn’t go, I called
upon them to disperse and they wouldn’t go, I will not call upon
them again.” And not long after that he passed away.

Then, when the Hands reminded the Bahá’ís of the goals of
the Ten Year Crusade, the whole Bahá’í world rose up and the
Crusade was won. With the winning of the Crusade we had the
wonderful Congress here, and the House of Justice had been
elected. And this is where the House of Justice comes into the
picture.

The Universal House of Justice was faced with this situation
once it was elected: what happens to the Guardianship? There
had been some disagreement among the friends. Some said
“Obviously the Will and Testament says how the Guardian is to
be appointed, this can’t be done, so there can’t be any
Guardian.” Others were saying “Obviously there must be a
Guardian, it’s part of the whole Administrative Order. There
must be a Guardian.” The Hands very wisely said “Stop
speculating, that’s not your business. Only the Universal House
of Justice can give an answer.” And I remember that, when
Mason Remey broke the Covenant, claiming to be the second
Guardian, and the French NSA followed him, a new NSA was
quickly elected and a meeting of all the European National
Spiritual Assemblies was called, attended by the members of the
new French NSA. The Hand of the Cause Mr Faizi came to
Europe and attended this conference. He told all the friends,
“The House of Justice is shortly going to come into existence.
Beware! Don’t form any preconceived conceptions of what the
House of Justice will decide, or you will test yourself. Be ready

\[1\] Lights of ‘Irfán Book Nine                                    375

for whatever it decides.”

From the point of view of the House of Justice this was, of
course, a tremendous problem. The Will and Testament, you
see, does not say how a Guardian is to be appointed. The Will
and Testament says firstly, about Shoghi Effendi, that Shoghi
Effendi will be succeeded by the first-born of his lineal
descendants. Now one problem is what is meant by lineal? Is it
only his children or does it include the other collateral branches.
We don’t know, we never had to answer the question. But that’s
in the air. Then, later on in the Will it states that the Guardian
must appoint his successor in his lifetime and this choice is to
be approved by the nine Hands of the Cause of God in the Holy
Land. If the Guardian’s eldest son does not fulfil the spiritual
qualities of appointment then he should choose another branch
and appoint him. It says nothing about what the Guardian
should do if all his sons turn out to be hopeless. Or if there’s no
one he could appoint. Which is what happened. The Guardian
had no sons, and all his brothers and sisters and cousins had
broken the Covenant. There was no branch for him to appoint.
People asked why the Guardian did not say anything about this.

The House of Justice in one of its letters, written on 27 May
19663, says we should understand that “in his very silence there
is a wisdom and a sign of his infallible guidance.” If you look at
the way he explains the Will and Testament it is quite clear that
the Guardian’s function is interpretation of the Sacred texts. He
interprets the Faith, he defends the Faith, he does not legislate
on what the text leaves open. And he himself used to stress that
he was meticulous in not legislating. Even with the Declaration
of Trust and By-laws of National Spiritual Assemblies, he got
the American National Assembly to formulate and enact the
Declaration of Trust and By-laws, informed by his guidance.
But he didn’t legislate them. He got a National House of Justice
to make this law. It wasn’t for him to say what the friends
should do if the Will and Testament leaves something
uncovered. When some friends had expressed to him their
worries, he had said that they had the Will and Testament and
the Universal House of Justice to turn to. And that’s what he
did. He couldn’t have said anything, it wasn’t a matter of
interpretation, so he didn’t say anything.

But then the Universal House of Justice was faced with the
problem: what do we have to do? Are we given this function of
legislation just so that in such a situation we can appoint a
successor? If we cannot appoint a successor, could we make a
law of how a successor can be appointed for Shoghi Effendi? Is

that why we have this authority? Or is that something far
beyond our capacity and it would be a breach of our authority
to do that? This consultation had to be worked through and the
House of Justice also consulted the Hands in the Holy Land.
We now know exactly what the House of Justice eventually
said, in its message of 9 October 19634: “The Universal House
of Justice finds that there is no way to appoint or to legislate to
make it possible to appoint a second Guardian to succeed
Shoghi Effendi.”. That is what it decided and it is all it decided.
Don’t go extrapolating this with your own understandings. We
are not interpreters of the Cause, any of us. The House of
Justice is not the Interpreter of the Cause, it is not a prophet. It
stated what it concluded and we know what it is. That is
enough.

Later when friends asked questions, the House of Justice
explained how these events did not undermine the Covenant,
how the House of Justice’s authority was clearly in the texts,
and how authoritative interpretation, in the absence of the
Guardian, is no longer there. You should make yourselves
familiar with these letters.5

Later, also, the House of Justice had to decide whether it
could appoint more Hands of the Cause of God, but this is a
different situation. You see, the text of the Will and Testament
is different in the two situations, it doesn’t say how a Guardian
is to be appointed by his predecessor, it says how the living
Guardian is to appoint his successor. It is an active statement,
not a passive one. In the case of the Hands it does say how the
Hands are to be appointed: by the Guardian. It is a passive
statement, not an active one. So, without the Guardian you
cannot appoint any Hands. The House of Justice then had to
discuss this whole relationship between the House of Justice
and the Hands. Had it authority to tell them what to do? In the
absence of the Guardian, yes, it was the Head of the Faith. So it
then developed its relationship with the Hands. Then it was able
to bring into being the Boards of Counsellors, who are not
Hands, but they perform some of the functions of the Hands,
and they are able to carry forward this whole side of the
teaching and protection of the Faith, that the Hands had been
responsible for.

In all this work of filling in the gaps in the system – of
reconstructing the system – the House of Justice was
continually referring back to the texts of the Guardian and
consulting the Hands. It used to meet regularly every week with
the Hands of the Cause in the Holy Land and, every time the

Hands had a Conclave each year, it would meet with the
Conclave and discuss the next major decision to be made. So
there was a very close inter-relationship between the Hands and
the House of Justice. It was a profoundly loving relationship
that deepened over the years. A very sad experience for the
members of the House of Justice over these past years has been
the passing of the Hands.

Two very serious events have, as it were, burned the hearts of
the members of the House of Justice. One is the persecution in
Iran where it had to study every aspect of the situation, seek the
advice of the friends in Iran and then decide what should be
done on each occasion, hoping and praying that no action it
took would precipitate any worse persecutions. This gradually
took things forward. To a major degree, the guidance had the
desired effect, but the friends continued to suffer very much in
Iran and this has been a burden on the House for many years.
The other has been the gradual loss of the Hands of the Cause –
this whole institution which had been there, as a faithful
bulwark, since the Universal House of Justice came into being.
Slowly individual Hands passed away. Some suddenly, some
through old age. One, Enoch Olinga, being murdered. From the
House of Justice members’ point of view they were not just
high officers of the Faith that we were losing, they were
intimate friends that we would not see any more.

It was the passing of ‘Amatu’l-Bahá Rúhíyyih Khánum on 19

January 2000, however, that had the most profound effect on
the Bahá’í World Centre. She had been a tower of strength to
the Universal House of Justice for all those years. She had
served the Guardian with unshakable fidelity and she
unhesitatingly transferred this loyalty to the House of Justice.
And just as she often asked the Guardian questions, she was
often raising issues with the House of Justice. I remember, one
evening when I was on pilgrimage, one of the pilgrims at the
dinner table asked Shoghi Effendi to confirm whether what he
had just said meant so and so. Rúhíyyih Khánum obviously
thought that the pilgrim had misunderstood, and she intervened
and said “Oh no!” and the Guardian turned to her and said “Oh
yes!” This is in front of the pilgrims! The Guardian spoke so
freely in front of the pilgrims. And there was this lovely
relationship between him and Rúhíyyih Khánum and he would,
as it were, pull her leg occasionally. She used to take little
vitamin pills, and he would comment at the table about
Americans’ being very fond of pills. There was this complete
freedom of expression and absolute devotion that she gave to

the Guardian, that she transferred to the House of Justice.
Again and again, if she thought something was going wrong at
the World Centre, or something developing that could lead to
problems, she would come and meet with the House of Justice
and say what she thought and what she recommended be done.
And then she faithfully followed whatever the House of Justice
decided. So the loss of ‘Amatu’l-Bahá, in this and in countless
other ways was a tremendous blow to the House of Justice. But,
thank God, Mr ‘Alí-Akbar Furútan was to live for almost
another four more years, until 26 November 2003, and we still
have the blessing of the presence of Dr ‘Alí-Muhammad Varqá,
a Hand of the Cause who is also the occupant of the oldest
institution in the whole Bahá’í World Order: The Trustee of
Huqúqu’lláh. This is a very great, a vital, institution, and Dr
Varqá is still taking part in its development6.

These years have seen the inter-locking relationship between
the Guardian and the House of Justice in both administrative
developments and the teaching work As would be expected, the
House of Justice has carried forward and developed the pattern
that Shoghi Effendi established. Over these decades, as the
House of Justice mentioned in a recent letter, the whole Bahá’í
world has been experimenting and learning, and it has been able
to summarize the lessons of what works well and what is less
fruitful. This is really what the present push of the Faith is, this
whole matter of training institutes, the core activities, the
development of clusters, is a systematic approach to the
teaching work which the House of Justice has deduced from the
successes of the friends in their pursuit of their work. That is
why now, I think, things need to go forward so fast.

We are seeing, I think, an interaction, a kind of spiritual
conversation between the Universal House of Justice and the
Bahá’í world on how things are best done. As the Bahá’í world
responds to the guidance of the House of Justice, we can see
the Faith going faster and faster forward. This is the same
pattern as the Guardian followed.

What the future will hold we don’t know. But we can be
quite certain the Covenant is there, it is strong and nothing can
shake it. We had the Guardian for 36 years without the House
of Justice, and now we have the House of Justice for maybe
another thousand years without the Guardian – I don’t know
how long. It’s not our business, that is God’s business. At the
present time we have the Universal House of Justice and that is
quite enough to enable the Bahá’ís to build the World Order of
Bahá’u’lláh.

Thank you!

Questions a nd Answer s

Q: Why is membership of the House of Justice exclusively
confined to men?

A: The short answer to that is: I haven’t the faintest idea.

But I believe we should think about it, not in the particular
square in which the question is posed, but rather think a bit
about why it is a problem. How do we conceive of elections and
the nature of elections and the nature of being elected? You see,
in the world as a whole, democracies have usually evolved as a
result of a struggle against a tyranny. Either wresting power
from the monarch which has sort of happened in the British
constitutional process or, as in America, of constructing a
constitution which carefully pits each of three powers against
the others to try and counter-balance one another because you
cannot trust any one of them. Now this is the basic thing.
Democracy is regarded as a way of achieving power in order to
limit power. It’s all about power and that’s why you have this
odd concept of winning an election. That an election is
something that one person wins and another one loses, because
the candidates want to get power for some purpose.

The candidate may want to have power for beneficial ideas,
he may want all this for the good of the people. He may also
want power for very bad ideas. Hitler was elected
democratically in Germany and then got the power and misused
it. It is all about power and the limiting of power. Now my
point is that, in the Bahá’í administration, that is a total
misconception. Bahá’í elections have nothing to do with power.
Bahá’í elections and the whole administration is to do with
service. Nobody ever seeks to be elected or appointed,
(Although I do remember one year we did have a letter to the
House of Justice from an individual Bahá’í who said he thought
he would make a very good Counsellor!). But that’s not the
normal approach because it isn’t the Bahá’í concept. You don’t
say I would like to be the Chairman of a Local Assembly, how
do I get myself elected? It just shouldn’t occur to Bahá’ís.

The whole Bahá’í process gives absolute freedom to the
electors and no freedom at all to those who have been elected,
or very little freedom. There are no nominations, there is no
electioneering, the electors are left free to use their own good
sense as to who are the nine people who are best suited to be on
this particular body. And they vote. Now the nine people who

are elected are not given a choice as to whether or not they want
to serve. The Guardian said he deprecated refusal to serve. If
you are elected, you serve, unless there is a very good reason
why you cannot, in which case you ask the Assembly to allow
you to resign. Which is what happens to members of the House
of Justice when they get decrepit like me. You have to ask “May
I resign because I cannot do my work properly?” The House of
Justice says “Yes” and you can resign. And that’s what’s
happened in each case when a member of the House of Justice
has resigned, not because they are a certain age, but because
they have come to a conclusion that they cannot carry out the
work the House of Justice requires them to carry out. So that’s
the situation.

Now, the voter conveys authority to the people he or she
elects. But the power in the Bahá’í Faith, as the Guardian said, is
in the hands of the individual believers. The Assembly can do
nothing unless the individual believers do what they are guided
to do.

So the thinking is that the people who are voting are
conveying authority upon a group of people to carry out what
they believe in their own judgment is the right thing. Therefore
it is quite wrong for anyone who is elected to think “Ah, good!
Now I have some power, now I can get this thing done.” That’s
not his job, his job or her job is to serve on the Assembly and
to be a member of a consultative body to find out what is the
correct thing to do in a particular situation taking into account
the wishes of the Bahá’ís and the conditions of the Bahá’ís.
What, therefore, does this mean for women, as far as
membership on the Universal House of Justice is concerned?
And it’s only that body – all the other bodies of the Bahá’í Faith
that are appointed or elected are open to men and women. The
only thing that happens is that women are not permitted to be
elected to the Universal House of Justice. But then this isn’t a
refusal to give them power. It is an exemption from having to
perform a service. Every Bahá’í man in the world, if he is
elected, has to perform this duty. You can’t have a man elected
to the House of Justice saying “Sorry I am too busy, I’m in the
middle of my career, I’m a great artist, please I can’t…” David
Ruhe was in a situation like that. He was a fine doctor, and he
was an expert in medical education, and he loved that and he
was about to ask permission to resign from the American NSA
to get back to his profession, when he was elected to the House
of Justice. And no one asked any more questions. He was
elected and he rendered great services, and at the same time he

managed to do some medical work which in itself was a service
to the Faith in Haifa.

This is the way you should think about the issue. If it’s an
exemption from performing a service maybe you would say this
is not very polite to women, but that’s an interpretation. The
fact remains that it is an exemption in that sense. It is not
something they are entitled to have – some power they are
entitled to get – of which they are deprived

This is merely my own thinking about it. But think is what
you have to do. You have to think outside the square and
consider what is the nature of service, what is the nature of
administration, and what is the concept of power and authority
in the Bahá’í community. Then ultimately as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says,
a time will come when it will be as clear as the noonday sun. As
yet, I don’t think it is.

Q: Please tell us something more about the personality of
Shoghi Effendi, for example, about his voice, his smile, how he
chanted and his sense of humour.

A: I never heard Shoghi Effendi chant because the westerners
didn’t. He chanted in the presence of the eastern men, he took
them to the Shrine and chanted there. But I am sure he must
have had a very melodious chanting voice. The Persian friends
who heard him said he did. And his speaking voice was very
melodious. It was a strong voice, it wasn’t a loud voice. But it
was strong and very clear. And he spoke beautiful English. He
was crystal clear in his thinking. One night he got us to look at
the map of the world that he was designing and his hands were
quite firm as he was pointing out various things, vigorous
hands, strong hands and vigorous. He had very beautiful hands,
fine and nicely formed. Rúhíyyih Khánum said that the Greatest
Holy Leaf used to hold Shoghi Effendi’s hands and say “These
are my Father’s hands” because he had hands very like those of
Bahá’u’lláh. And his humour: he had a very acute sense of
humour. One night I remember we were looking at designs for
temples and he got Rúhíyyih Khánum to get out some designs
that were rejected for the Temple in Tihrán. They were most
peculiar. He got Anna Grossmann to hold up one of them so we
could see it, and he said, “Look! It looks like a frog. Anna
what’s the German for frog?” Anna couldn’t get the German
word Frosch out because she was laughing, and then the
Guardian began to laugh. I think he was of that generation when
it wasn’t polite to laugh out loud. He didn’t guffaw, he sort of
bubbled over with laughter. Everyone who knew him said he had

a very acute sense of humour and a very lovely sense of humour.
He was very kindly and very understanding to people.

One of Rúhíyyih Khánum’s favourite stories was about the
Guardian and Charles Dunning. Here I should explain the
seating in the dining room in those days. The dining table was in
a small room, placed so that the long side faced the door
through which one entered. The Guardian sat at the right end of
the long side, facing the incoming pilgrims, whom he would
welcome as they entered.. To his right sat ‘Amatu’l-Bahá
Rúhíyyih Khánum and the members of the International Council
who were present. To his left, at the end of the table sat either
Charles Mason Remey or, if he was absent, the most recently
arrived pilgrim. As new pilgrims arrived they moved on down
the side of the table opposite the Guardian. A Knight of
Bahá’u’lláh, however, would not move on down; he or she
would remain near the Guardian.

Charlie Dunning was the Knight of Bahá’u’lláh for the
Orkney Islands, a wonderful Bahá’í. He was a little man, and he
looked like Popeye. He and Shoghi Effendi would talk, and he
would wave his finger at Shoghi Effendi’s nose and say
“Guardian. they tell me so and so”, and the Guardian would lean
towards him and answer, and they would talk in this way. The
Guardian loved Charles Dunning. He saw the beauty and the
spirit in Charlie although most people would think he was a
funny little man. And the thing that struck me after Charlie had
been on pilgrimage, and it’s made me think a lot about the way
one’s appearance mirrors one’s soul, you might say, because
Charlie spoke at the National Convention about his pilgrimage,
and the thing that struck me was that superficially Charlie was
an ugly little man, but when he was talking about his pilgrimage
he was beautiful. Really beautiful. And he hadn’t changed, his
features were the same, but this was a beautiful person talking,
and I think his soul was as it were reflecting what the Guardian
had seen in him.

So these are just some of the characteristics of the Guardian.

I am afraid it is not very much, I’m not very good at explaining.
Shoghi Effendi is in a sense inexplicable. I just wish you all
could have met him.

Q: How would you explain the concept of the infallibility of
the Universal House of Justice to a seeker?

A: Infallibility is such a difficult word to define. And if
possible I think, if you are talking to a seeker, unless the seeker

is very close to the Faith, avoid the issue, because it sounds so
strange in the western ear and is linked up of course with the
concept of papal infallibility in the minds of western people. So
there is a prejudice against it to start with.

In a sense, the infallibility of the Universal House of Justice
is the culmination of consultation. The principle of
consultation is that one mind is generally not enough, that it is
good for several people to consult together with the idea of
achieving a good solution. This is simply a process of the
interrelationship of human beings, of creating a bigger mind
than one. It isn’t only for the House pf Justice. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
says that if a Local Spiritual Assembly consults in the right way
it will receive divine guidance. It is, one might say, putting
itself in harmony with the spirit of the universe, and, when it
does, it decides the right things. The only difference between
the Local Assembly and the Universal House of Justice is that
the Universal House of Justice always achieves such a decision.
Now that’s an oversimplification, the way you might explain it
to a seeker, it describes a way of electing people in various
stages, who know the Faith well enough, so that when they
consult together they produce a decision that’s in harmony with
the facts, and with the nature of the universe and, in that sense,
is infallible.

I think that in reality it is much more than that, and it's
difficult to specify it. I mean most consultations of the House
of Justice are like any Assembly consultation: a consensus
emerges. But the House of Justice has to be much more patient
in getting its decision. It knows it has to be the right decision,
and I remember on one occasion where it got to the point where
eight of the nine members thoroughly agreed to one particular
course of action and one member didn’t. And the reaction of
the other eight was: what has he seen that we haven’t? And to
continue consulting. On one occasion I remember, it ended up
with all the other eight agreeing with the ninth. But I have seen
similar situations when we thought we hadn’t quite got it, and
asked to continue consulting, and eventually the majority
decided “Yes, we have understood it, we just don’t agree, that’s
all.” and we’d take a majority decision. But it needs careful
thinking and the wish to get the right answer. Sometimes the
Guardian said he would occasionally be given unusual insights as
a result of the power of Bahá’u’lláh, it wasn’t his own capacity,
it was Bahá’u’lláh wanting him to know something, and so he
knew it. There’s a story I heard of the Guardian coming into the
room one day waving an unopened letter saying, “He’s lying!”

Now he may have known the character of the person who was
writing, I don’t know, but that’s the sort of thing that makes
you sit up. But I remember one occasion when the House of
Justice was discussing a question, and it was the end of the day
and there was a unanimous decision, we all wanted to do the
same thing, but suddenly someone said: “Hadn’t we better wait
until tomorrow? Do we have to make this decision tonight?” So
we decided to wait until the next morning. The next morning in
the mail came information which changed the whole picture.
That’s not a thing to discuss with a seeker because it sounds
peculiar. We have to be aware of these things: that when we are
dealing with the spiritual world, peculiar things can happen. But
generally the House of Justice’s consultation is just like that of
any Local Assembly which is practised in consultation.
Q: What pitfalls should a budding Bahá’í scholar avoid?

A: One has to realize what one is dealing with when one is
dealing with the Faith. I remember when it was suggested one
day that, at some Bahá’í institution, we should have a course
that would lead to a Master in Bahá’í Studies, and the House of
Justice said this is impossible. You can’t have a human being
saying “I am a Bahá’í and I am a Master of Bahá’í studies.” How
big is this revelation for a 1,000 years or more? How can you be
a master of it? It’s terminological nonsense. You can have a
Master’s degree in the application of the Bahá’í teachings to
conflict management or something like that, but in Bahá’í
Studies? No one is a master of Bahá’í studies. All of us are at the
kindergarten stage of understanding the Faith. And we shall be
for quite a long time yet. So it’s first of all getting one’s
understanding of the Faith into perspective. To what extent can
one expect to be a Master of something that is a Revelation of
God to take us forward for one or more thousand years. It’s
impossible. But a scholar shouldn’t ever conceive of himself as
someone who has understood everything.

The essence of a scholar is a person who has the
temperament, and the skill and the capacity to study a thing
seriously. To study it meticulously, and profoundly and
carefully. That is a scholar, and a budding scholar is someone
who is learning how to do this. It is not always easy, it’s very
difficult in present day society, for example, I remember one
scholar saying that, in order to write anything acceptable, you
had to have read ‘the literature’ and been able to quote it. What
in the world did he mean by ‘the literature’? There’s a vast
number of letters by Bahá’u’lláh, which have not been translated
yet. OK, so he can’t mean all Bahá’í literature. He meant the

published writings of other scholars on that subject. That isn’t
all the literature; it happens to be what a few scholars have
written in English. What about all the Chinese scholars or the
Indian scholars, or the Latin American or German scholars. You
can’t read all the literature on any subject, you may read all the
current literature, but that is hardly adequate. What, therefore,
should we understand by this need “to read and quote all the
literature?”

I think we must accept that the pattern of modern academic
scholarship isn’t simply a matter of scholarship carried out in
order to understand something. We have got a body of people
who are engaged in academia and who, out of courtesy to their
fellow scholars, should acknowledge the contribution other
scholars have made to their thinking. Say, if Mr Smith has read
Mr Jones’ book and he has involved it in his thinking, he should
say he has read Mr Jones’ book. Likewise, if there is a published
source that counters Mr. Smith’s argument, it would be helpful
to the reader for Mr. Smith to refer to it and indicate why he
does not accept its validity. That’s where you have to quote
your sources and give your references to other people.

But how is one to conceive of this obligation? Are you going
to say that, when a writer presents his ideas cogently, but
without quoting everyone else who has written on the subject,
that his scholarship is worthless because he hasn’t read this and
that? It may not be worthless. It may just have gaps. So I think
that budding Bahá’í scholars should get into the way of
accepting that whatever they produce is, in its essence, full of
gaps, and be content with that, and try to decrease the number
of gaps and increase the accuracy of what they are saying, to be
meticulous. That I think is the way to do scholarship.

Then you can do all sorts of things, but I think one has to be
devoted to the truth of the matter not necessarily to certain
patterns of scholarship. Much scholarship these days is basically
100% materialist. For a Bahá’í to leave out everything except
materialism is difficult, to say the least!

Q: How do we guard against the                  emergence     of
fundamentalism within the Bahá’í community?

A: It think you have to have a very good sense of humour.

And patience. Some people are very eager. And they sound
enthusiastic, too enthusiastic. And then one’s got to get people
to be able to look around things. Does it make sense? One has
got the principle that Bahá’u’lláh says one should go back to the

Texts. And we should base everything on the Revelation. But
also on experience in life. One of the problems people
sometimes fall into, sounds like fundamentalism. It is to say
“Look! In this text Bahá’u’lláh says so and so, and that’s it.
Finish!” But then they’ve forgotten that in another text
Bahá’u’lláh says something else that means exactly the opposite.
And you have to understand that, and see how the texts relate to
one another, and think about things.

A fundamentalist temperamentally is someone who wants to
stop you thinking. And of course that’s where a sense of
humour comes in, because you say this is ridiculous. The way to
stop getting into fundamentalism is to insist on thinking about
things. Examine them. Remember what the Guardian wrote. I’ve
heard some people say that independent investigation of truth is
until you find Bahá’u’lláh; after that it doesn’t apply. But the
Guardian has written that the Bahá’í Faith “enjoins upon its
followers the primary duty of an unfettered search after
truth…”7 So why, therefore, do you continue investigating truth
after you have found Bahá’u’lláh? The answer is because you
have the humility to recognise that you are a fallible human
being and unless you keep thinking hard and investigating hard,
you are not going to understand what Bahá’u’lláh said. You are
going to misunderstand it, and that’s fundamentalism:
misunderstanding and misapplying a Revelation and insisting
that you are right.

Q: How should we approach the study of the writings of
Shoghi Effendi?

A: One should study the writings of Shoghi Effendi as part
of one’s general study. We have the Bahá’í law that you are
meant to read the holy scriptures morning and evening, and I
think it’s very good, when doing that in the case of the writings
of Bahá’u’lláh, to make a pattern always of reading through all
the writings of Bahá’u’lláh one book after another until you
finish the lot and then start again. If you just read the bits you
like, it’s not the best idea. Each time you read through the book
it will enrich your understanding, which helps you the next time
you read through, so you continue to read and that you have to
do anyway, whether you are studying the writings of Shoghi
Effendi or not.

But to understand the Revelation, it is vital also to read the
Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi Effendi. You can take
excerpts from the Guardian’s writings, such as

Call to the Nations, and it is helpful to do so, but,
fundamentally, I think one should, as far as possible, simply
read through all his published writings, at least the major ones.
Just read them through, patiently, and think about them.
Because there are many things he covered. And it is probably
best to start with what the Guardian himself wrote rather than
depending solely upon collections of excerpts from letters
written on his behalf by his Secretaries.

But then that isn’t all you are doing in your life because
you’re living in your local community, and perhaps helping to
administer it. You are involved in teaching the Faith. So you’ve
got to keep looking at many books. But for a methodical study
of the Guardian’s writings, there’s nothing like going right
through, reading the whole of God Passes By and all his writings
like that, slowly, slowly, I think!8

Q: Could you please share some of your recollections of the
first International Convention for the election of the Universal
House of Justice in 1963?

A: They are rather limited, my recollections, because of
course I was on the Council and one of the functions of the
Council was to prepare for the election of the House of Justice,
and so we had all the nitty-gritty work like getting the ballots
out, getting the delegates registered and so on. It was a very
exciting time. The Hands were very worried, because they were
deeply concerned that nothing should go wrong in that election.
There were some Bahá’ís at that time, one or two, who had
obviously set out to tour the Bahá’í world, donating things here
and there and making themselves very popular and very well-
known, and the Hands were worried that in some cases it was
not genuine. Some people are very generous people, but in other
cases there was a little electioneering going on. But the Hands
thought “What can we do? If we interfere it is the same thing,
we must just trust to Bahá’u’lláh”. And they did, and none of
those who were fiddle-faddling got elected. So the delegates
were sensible enough, and Bahá’u’lláh looked after His Cause
well enough, that the problem went away. But that didn’t stop
the Hands worrying at the time. So as part of that process of
trying not to influence the ballots when the delegates were
arriving, the Hands decided that no males at the World Centre
would contact the delegates – At all, no matter who they were.
The women in Haifa looked after the delegates, took them on
their pilgrimages and so on.

I had a difficulty at one point: being the Assistant Secretary

of the International Council I had to get in touch with Borrah
Kavelin, who was both a member of the Council and Chairman
of the American NSA. He was the Member at Large of the
Council. And we were going to have a Council meeting and I
had to get word to Borrah to come and join the meeting of the
Council. He was staying in a hotel called the Lev HaCarmel
Hotel on top of the mountain. So I went up there in the
evening, and the only way I could think of getting a letter to
him was to sneak through the bushes and the shrubbery up to
the office of the hotel and pop it through the window to the
staff and tell them “Please give that to Mr Kavelin”, so I did
that, and disappeared through the bushes back out again. And
the Council had its meeting.

These are little details but they were part of the care the
Hands took in the management of the Convention. Then of
course there was the question of where to hold the election and
Rúhíyyih Khánum hoped very much we could have it in the
Masters’ House. One evening, ‘Alí and I were with her, and we
thought we probably could manage it if we took all the doors
off the rooms in the central hall, so she suggested we try it out.
So we took all the doors off and measured all the floors and
found we could just get all the delegates into that hall, and
that’s how it was decided to hold the election in the Master’s
House, which was very appropriate and wonderful. The spirit of
the delegates was so beautiful, they were coming to elect the
Universal House of Justice and the whole atmosphere was
beautiful, they had a little pilgrimage first and they then
gathered in the Master’s House, and the election took place, and
the next day the results were announced in the Convention
session at Beit Harofe. So it was a very beautiful experience.

Q: Of all the many extraordinary experiences you had in the
Holy Land is it possible to single out one that was the most
moving?

A: It is almost impossible to do so because there were so
many moving events. And many of them were very similar. I
mean moving in the sense of sad. There were many sad
happenings: the news of the martyrdoms in Iran, the murder of
Enoch Olinga. Very sad things happened. Then there were joyful
things, the news of wonderful teaching work, the attainment of
vital objectives, such as the completion of the Constitution,
and so on.

In the process of consultation there were some things that
were very moving. Sometimes it would happen that suddenly a

lot of individuals would write asking very similar questions or
suggesting similar subjects for the House of Justice to consider.
At another time the House of Justice might have scheduled a
consultation on a subject that it felt required consideration in
depth. In either case – and, indeed, on other occasions too – the
consultation would start in the normal way, with members
exchanging ideas, and then, quite suddenly one would get the
feeling that the consultation was taking off. And it would
evolve way above anything that was being thought of in the
earlier stages of consultation. A whole new concept would
emerge in this process of consultation. And the feeling, as I
recall it, would be one of exaltation: “This is right! this is what
the answer should be!” and no one had thought of it before. It
was as if events had conspired for the House of Justice to
consult on this particular problem, and this was the conclusion
that emerged. That was a very exalting feeling, a very moving
one to have. Apart from that there was nothing in particular.
There were many happy things as well as sad ones.

Thank you!
