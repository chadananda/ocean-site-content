The yearly commemoration of the Martyrdom of the Báb is one of the nine major
Bahá’ı́ holy days on which work is suspended. Observed by Bahá’ı́s in the Middle
East on 28 Sha‘bán—in accordance with the Islamic lunar calendar—the occasion
is annually observed on July 9 throughout the rest of the Bahá’ı́ world. For many
participants, it is a deeply moving experience.
Sayyid ‘Alı́-Muhammad of Shiraz (1819–1850)—known by his spiritual title as

˙
“the Báb” (“the Gate”) and regarded as the precursor and herald of Mı́rzá H.usayn-
‘Alı́ Núrı́, known as Bahá’u’lláh (the “Splendor” or “Glory of God,” 1817–1892)—
was martyred on July 9, 1850, in Tabrı́z, Persia (now Iran). The circumstances of
the Báb’s martyrdom, and its subsequent commemoration as a Bahá’ı́ holy day, will
be discussed below.

The Báb founded the 19th-century movement generally known as Bábism, an
independent (albeit short-lived) religion that clearly broke from its parent religion,
Persian (i.e., Twelver Shi‘i) Islam. As Orientalist Edward G. Browne observed
regarding the Bábı́ phenomenon, “whatever its actual destiny may be, is of that
stuff whereof world-religions are made.” As Browne predicted, the Bábı́ religion
emerged as a “new world-religion” through its eventual transformation into what
is now known as the Bahá’ı́ Faith.

While the Bábı́ and Bahá’ı́ religions are distinct, they are intimately related both
historically and doctrinally. The writings of the Báb, for instance, are considered
sacred scripture by all Bahá’ı́s. A number of the Báb’s religious laws were adopted
and adapted by Bahá’u’lláh, as was the Badı́‘ calendar (a solar calendar of

> 19 months of 19 days, each named after godly attributes to foster goodly virtues,
> which the Báb had created. Because the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh are so historically
> and doctrinally related, they are actually called the “Twin Founders” of the Bahá’ı́
Faith.

According to Armin Eschraghi, the Báb established a new, post-Islamic faith
> that fulfilled all the criteria of an independent religion. These include a new
> founder, newly revealed scriptures, a new set of metaphysical and theological
> teachings distinct from those of Islam, new religious laws and principles. In
> revealing his new code of laws, the Persian Bayán (1848), the Báb intended to
> pave the way for the advent of the Promised One; to provoke the clerical establish-
> ment and shatter the foundations of their often-abused institutionalized authority;
and to prove the independence of his own religion as distinct from Islam.

The Báb declared that he was a messenger from God sent to proclaim the immi-
> nent advent of one greater than himself. Religious and state persecution fell upon
> his followers, leading to the torture and religious martyrdom of thousands. In
> July 1848, the Báb was summoned to Tabrı́z to stand trial before Muslim clerics.
> Ordered by H.ájı́ Mı́rzá Áqásı́, prime minister of Persia, the trial was doubtless
> intended to publicly discredit the Báb. Presiding over the trial was the young
> Crown Prince, who later became the reigning monarch of Persia, Násiri’d-Dı́n
Sháh. The Báb was pressured to recant his writings and claims.

Instead, the Báb openly proclaimed that he was the promised Qá’im, the
> expected deliverer in Shi‘i Islam (and, as the Mahdı́, by Sunni and Shi‘i Muslims
> alike). To subject him to public ridicule by exposing his supposed ignorance, the
> Báb was then questioned about abstruse points of Arabic grammar, theology, and
> religious law. Throughout the course of the trial, the Báb staunchly refused to
> renounce his messianic claims and writings. After the trial reached its unsuccess-
> ful conclusion, the Báb was bastinadoed and again imprisoned. In their verdict,
> the clergy pronounced the Báb insane, thinking that a declaration of madness
would quell the religious furor that the Báb had created.

However, a series of Bábı́ defensive clashes with the attacking state militias at
> Shaykh Tabarsı́, Nayrı́z, and Zanján persuaded the new prime minister Mı́rzá Taqı́
> Khán that the unrest would endure unless the Báb was put to death. The prime
> minister therefore ordered the execution of the Báb, who was then brought to
> Tabrı́z. When, at the house of Mullá Muhammad Mamaqánı́, the Báb still would
> not recant his claims, a leader of the Tabrı́z Shaykhı́s, Mamaqánı́, issued the Báb’s
death warrant by public execution at an army barracks in Tabrı́z.

Imprisoned with the Báb in the barracks cell were his secretaries, the two broth-
> ers Siyyid Hasan and Siyyid H.usayn Yazdı́, along with a young Bábı́ mullá of
> Tabrı́z, Mı́rzá Muhammad-Alı́ Zunúzı́, who was called Anı́s (“Companion”) by
> the Báb. Arrested for openly proclaiming the Báb’s new religion, the young Anı́s
> refused to recant and so was sentenced to death with the Báb. The Báb chose Anı́s
> to die with him together as companion martyrs in a single execution, rather than in
separate executions.

At noon, the Báb and Anı́s were brought out into the barracks square, and,
bound by ropes, suspended from a spike driven into the wall of the barracks. The
surrounding rooftops were thronged with an estimated 10,000 onlookers.

The Russian Armenian Sám Khán commanded the Christian Bahádurán Regi-
ment, which was ordered to carry out the execution. Although accounts of the
Báb’s execution vary in details, all agree that, after thick smoke—from the volley
of 750 muskets—had cleared, the Báb had vanished, with Anı́s standing before the
astonished multitude, unhurt. The Báb’s escape from the first volley of musket fire
is beyond doubt, as his ropes were cut by the shots. One witness to this extraordi-
nary event, Sir Justin Shiel, Queen Victoria’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister
Plenipotentiary, in Tehran on July 22, 1850, records:

> The founder of this sect has been executed at Tabreez. He was killed by a vol-
> ley of musketry, and his death was on the point of giving his religion a lustre
> which would have largely increased his proselytes. When the smoke and dust
> cleared away after the volley, Báb was not to be seen, and the populace pro-
> claimed that he had ascended to the skies. The balls had broken the ropes by
> which he was bound, but he was dragged from the recess where after some
> search he was discovered and shot. His death, according to the belief of his
> disciples, will make no difference as Báb must always exist. (Momen, The
> Bábı́ and Bahá’ı́ Religions, 1844–1944, 78)

A frantic search ensued, and the Báb was found back in his cell, evidently com-
pleting dictation to his secretary that was earlier interrupted. Soldiers swiftly
cleared the barracks square, and the Báb was once more suspended by ropes for
execution, with Anı́s placed in front of the Báb. But Sám Khán refused to order
his troops to fire again and so the Muslim Nádirı́ Regiment was summoned. On
the second attempt, the Báb and Anı́s were instantly killed. Their bodies, in fact,
were fused together by the sheer number of bullets that struck them.

Despite the claims of some two dozen Bábı́s in their rival bids to succeed the
Báb, the majority of his coreligionists, the Bábı́s, turned to Bahá’u’lláh, who effec-
tively led the Bábı́ community until such time as he formally established the
Bahá’ı́ religion in 1863 by his announcement that he was the messianic figure
the Báb foretold, although the designation “people of Bahá” (i.e., followers of
Bahá’u’lláh, the Bahá’ı́s), was not current until March 1866. In 1873, Bahá’u’lláh
subsequently incorporated a number of the laws of the Báb, in modified form, in
his book of laws, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (“The Most Holy Book”).

Although not one of the holy days mentioned in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the martyr-
dom of the Báb was observed by Bahá’u’lláh. Two practices are associated with
the observance of the Martyrdom of the Báb. First, commemorations should take
place at noon, the time of the Báb’s execution. Second, the “Tablet of Visita-
tion”—a special commemorative prayer—is usually recited. Typically, it is
Nabı́l’s narrative of the events surrounding the martyrdom of the Báb that is read

76    Babaji Commemoration Day (July 25)

> on this occasion, although it is not a requirement to do so. Nabı́l’s narrative, which
> describes the prophetic passion of the Báb’s martyrdom in detail and is based on
> eyewitness accounts, is remarkably objective in style, yet never fails to stir deep
emotions in the hearts of participants in this solemnly commemorative holy day.
