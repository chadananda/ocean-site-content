For the past half century, religious leaders, scholars, and activists have begun to acknowledge that
religious traditions and practices have developed within the context of a wider planetary or natural
community. This area of reflection is variously known as “religion and ecology,” or “religion and nature”,
or “religion and the environment.” In The Spirit of Sustainability, religion and other scholars assess the
key ways in which religious ideas, beliefs, and practices have both promoted sustainability and served as
roadblocks. Coverage ranges from religious vegetarianism to understandings of the Earth as Gaia, from
the Lynn White Thesis to the field of “science and religion.” The volume offers readers a wide variety of
ways to look at “the spirit of sustainability.” At the end of each entry readers will find suggestions for
further study.

The Spirit of Sustainability maps out the “values” territory of sustainability, helping readers
understand the moral worlds, axial concepts, social practices, and major topics related to sustainability.
Through a collaboration with the Forum on Religion and Ecology (FORE), an established network of
leading scholars examine key concepts for understanding and implementing the values and practices of
sustainability. Coverage ranges widely, from the promise and problems of global and indigenous religions
to major theories in philosophy and environmental ethics, and then to professional practices and social
movements. As a whole, the volume describes the various goals of sustainability—ecological integrity,
economic health, human dignity, fairness to the future, social justice—as well as interpretive frameworks
for reasoning through their combined challenge.

In the 10-volume Berkshire Encyclopedia of Sustainability experts around the world provide
authoritative coverage of the growing body of knowledge about ways to restore the planet. Focused on
solutions, this interdisciplinary print and online publication draws from the natural, physical, and social
sciences. The result is a unified, organized, and peer-reviewed resource on sustainability that connects
academic research to real world challenges and provides a balanced, trustworthy perspective on the global
environmental challenges in the 21st century.
