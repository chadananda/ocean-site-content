Tehran (Tihrán), Iran
Capital city of Iran and birthplace of Bahá’u’lláh; called by Him the "Land of Tá"
(Ard-i-Tá); site of numerous important events in Bahá’í history. 1

in the mid-eighteenth century and became the
capital of Iran in 1788 under the Qajar ruler Aqa Muhammad Khan. Europeans visiting the city provided
estimates of its subsequent growth. In 1796 the city had no more than 15,000 residents.By 1817 the
population numbered between 60,000 and 70,000, with people of means leaving the city during the
extremely hot summer months for the cooler climate in nearby resorts in the foothills north of Tehran.
By 1861 the population had nearly doubled: 80,000 in the summer and 120,000 in the winter. Nine
years later, Nasir al-Din Shah began a major renovation of the city; its boundaries were expanded well
beyond the old town walls, and new walls and gates were built.

Tehran was rapidly modernized in the twentieth century,
particularly after World War II. The surrounding villages have
become integrated into a sprawling metropolitan city of some
600 square kilometers (240 square miles) with a population of
about eleven million in 2006.

house of His father, Mírzá Buzurg, a member of the nobility from Library
Núr in Mazandaran. During the years when Bahá’u’lláh was
growing up, His family customarily spent most of the year in Tehran, retiring in the hot summer months
to their garden property in the summer resort district of Shemiran, located in the foothills fifteen
kilometers (nine miles) north of Tehran, or to their mansion in Takúr, in the district of Núr in the
mountains of Mazandaran.

Bahá’u’lláh was, therefore, brought up in Tehran and lived in the capital after He married in 1835. In
that same year, Bahá’u’lláh’s father fell from favor at court and sustained great losses. The family
house in Tehran had to be sold. Bahá’u’lláh then rented a house near the Shemiran Gate in the
northeast part of the city. His children ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Mihdí, Mírzá, and Bahíyyih Khánum were born in
this rented house, in which the family lived until 1852.

Community. Bahá’í Media Bank                           The Báb remained a prisoner for the rest of His life and never

returned to the vicinity of the capital.

Tehran became a natural center for Bábí activities. It was the
point from which the writings of the Báb were distributed
between 1847 and 1850, when He was imprisoned in Mákú and
in Chihríq, another remote fortress in Azerbaijan. Manuscripts
were brought to Tehran, transcribed by Mírzá Ahmad Kátib
Qazvíní, and then disseminated.

Some of the most prominent Bábís spent time in Tehran or
made short stopovers while passing through the city on their
travels. When Táhirih (Fátimih Umm-Salamih, known also by the
title Qurratu’l-Ayn), one of the Báb’s outstanding disciples (See:
Letters of the Living), was held captive in the city of Qazvin     Courtyard in the bazaar of Tehran where many

followers of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh were executed.

Taqí on 25 October 1847, Bahá’u’lláh arranged for her to escape
and to be sheltered in Tehran. Bahá’u’lláh’s house appears to have been a focus for the Bábís; many
well-known figures—including Vahíd (Siyyid Yahyá Dárábí), formerly an influential cleric with close ties
to the shah—visited or stayed there.

As a consequence of the murder of Hájí Mullá Muhammad Taqí, Bahá’u’lláh Himself was first arrested in
Tehran. For His monetary assistance to a group of Bábís of Qazvin—who, though innocent, had been
arrested along with the assassin, brought to Tehran, and held under harsh conditions—Bahá’u’lláh was
detained for a few days in the house of a kad-khudá (ward chief) of Tehran. Subsequently, one of the
Bábís from Qazvin, Shaykh Sálih, was executed in Tehran, becoming the first Bábí to die for his faith in
Iran.

In 1850 a number of Bábís in Tehran were arrested and charged with allegedly plotting to kill the prime
minister, Mirza Taqi Khan. Eventually, seven of them, including the Báb’s uncle Hájí Siyyid ‘Alí, were
condemned to death. Since these seven individuals were well-respected members of society and the
charges against them were transparently false, leaders of their various professions made great efforts
to save them; the prisoners were promised their lives if they would recant their belief in the Báb, but
they refused. On 19 or 20 February 1850, in the Sabzih Maydán, a public square near the city prison,
large crowds witnessed their execution and the subsequent desecration of their bodies, which lay
unburied for three days. These individuals are remembered by Bahá’ís as "The Seven Martyrs of
Tehran."

Following the Báb’s execution in Tabriz in July 1850, His remains, which a small group of His followers
had managed to recover, were concealed for many years in Tehran. Several shrines and private homes
served as temporary hiding places until 1899, when the remains were taken to Palestine, where they
were later interred on Mount Carmel in Haifa (See: Bahá’í World Center.Early Development).

The Bábí community of Tehran fragmented after the Báb’s death. Several persons, including Shaykh ‘Alí
‘Azím and Siyyid Basír Hindí, put forward claims to leadership. During the summer of 1851, Mirza Taqi
Khan, the prime minister, ordered Bahá’u’lláh, who had rallied the Bábís since the tumultuous final
years of the Báb’s imprisonment, to leave the country for a time. Bahá’u’lláh traveled to the holy cities
of Iraq (places of pilgrimage in Shia Islam), remaining there until the spring of 1852.

In the gloom that descended upon the leaderless community, a number of the Bábís came together to
make desperate plans. Bahá’u’lláh heard of their plotting in May 1852, shortly after a new prime
minister, Mirza Aqa Khan, summoned Him back to Iran from His enforced exile. Although Bahá’u’lláh
tried to dissuade ‘Azím, who appears to have been the ringleader, three Bábís made an ill-fated
attempt on the life of Nasir al-Din Shah on 15 August 1852. Their pistols loaded with shot caused only
superficial wounds to the shah, but the attack unleashed a violent campaign of persecution against the
Bábís.

Before the attempt on the life of the shah, Bahá’u’lláh had been staying in Afchih, a summer resort in
the mountains some sixty kilometers (thirty-seven miles) northwest of Tehran, as the guest of the
prime minister’s brother. When He was notified of the attack and the immediate retribution against the
Bábís, instead of seeking refuge, as His friends urged, Bahá’u’lláh set out for the capital. En route He
stopped at his brother-in-law’s home in Zarkandih, a summer resort village north of Tehran near the
royal summer palace at Níyávarán in Shemiran. He was taken into custody there and forced to walk to
Tehran in the intense summer heat, bareheaded, barefoot, and in chains.

In Tehran all known Bábí males were arrested. Most of those not
killed immediately, including Bahá’u’lláh, were put into the
underground Siyáh-Chál (Black Pit) prison in the royal palace
compound. Of those imprisoned there, many were subsequently
executed. Although official records list by name more than thirty
Bábís killed in Tehran between August and December 1852,
other accounts report hundreds of deaths.

Among those executed were Siyyid Husayn Yazdí, one of the
Báb’s first disciples and His amanuensis, and Sulaymán Khán, a
prominent courtier. Táhirih, already imprisoned in the house of    The village of Afchih, near Tehran, where Bahá’u’lláh

Taken to a garden in the middle of the night, she was strangled and her body thrown down a well.

Bahá’u’lláh was one of the few to survive the Siyáh-Chál and the storm of persecutions that decimated
the remaining ranks of the Bábís. During the months that He spent in the Siyáh-Chál, he experienced a
series of visions that He later referred to as the start of His mission. On His release in December 1852,
His properties having been confiscated and His rented home looted, He stayed at His half-brother’s
residence near the arg, the fortress complex that included the royal palace and the seat of central
government. Exiled for life from Iran and given just one month to leave the country, Bahá’u’lláh chose
to go to Baghdad. He set out from Tehran, accompanied by His close family, on 12 January 1853.

The Bábí community of Tehran was shattered by the persecutions that followed the attempt on the life
of the shah. After a few years, however, the community began to regain its vigor. Later, in the Bahá’í
period, propagation of the religion in the city resulted in many new converts. The community also grew
as a continuous stream of Bahá’ís fleeing persecution in other parts of the country sought sanctuary in
the capital. These refugees, often destitute on arrival, began to settle in the poor quarters of Tehran.
Some districts in the Darvázih Qazvín and Sar Qabr Áqá areas of the town became known as Bábí
quarters.

THE BAHÁ’Í PERIOD TO 1921
Throughout the last half of the nineteenth century, many influential people in Tehran were greatly
opposed to the new religion. Foremost among these were Nasir al-Din Shah and his son Kamran Mirza,
the governor of Tehran, and two of the most important religious figures in the capital, Mullá ‘Alí Kaní
and Siyyid Sádiq Tabátabá’í Sanglají.

At least two main factors served to counter the political and religious hostility toward the Bahá’ís. First,
the shah could not afford to have mobs running through the streets of the capital, killing and looting,
as occurred elsewhere in the country during episodes of persecution. Such a breakdown of order would
have been an insult to the shah’s authority. Moreover, the presence of foreign ambassadors helped to
assure order in the capital, since their reports to their governments about violent disturbances would
have embarrassed the shah. Indeed, for humanitarian reasons, foreign ambassadors occasionally
intervened on behalf of the Bahá’ís in various parts of the country (note, in particular, the interventions
of Drummond Wolff, the British Minister in Tehran from 1888 to 1890, in response to persecutions of
Bahá’ís in Najafábád, Isfahan, and the village of Sidih).2

Second, the Bahá’ís could rely on a number of persons
who helped them and forewarned them of pending
persecutions. Rahím Khán Kan-kan, the farrásh-ghadáb
(royal executioner), was the person ordered by the
government to arrest Bahá’ís; because his daughter was
married to a Bahá’í, however, he would first warn them
through her, enabling them to avoid arrest. He also
assisted the Bahá’ís to obtain food during the famine of
1871\. A Bahá’í, Mírzá Faraj, was the cousin and píshkár
(steward) of ‘Ali Asghar Khan Aminu’s-Sultan, the prime
minister for much of this period. Many other Bahá’ís,
such as Sulaymán Khán Tunukábuní, a landowner and
notable of Tunukábun, moved in influential circles. Tá’irih

Ismá’íl Khán Mustawfí, was an army financial officer, and her mother, Habíbih Khánum, had worked as
a secretary in the andarún (women’s quarters) of the shah. Among the clerics, Shaykh Hádí Najmábádí,
a leading mujtahid (preeminent religious scholar and doctor of Islamic law), was favorable toward the
Bahá’í Faith.

Episodes of persecution did erupt in Tehran from time to time. Bahá’ís were arrested in 1868, 1872,
1873, 1876, 1888, and 1891. A particularly serious episode occurred in 1882, when some fifty Bahá’ís
were arrested and held for nineteen months. Bahá’ís were executed in Tehran, usually having been
arrested elsewhere and sent to Tehran for sentencing. Notable Tehran martyrs include Áqá Buzurg
Badí‘, the seventeen-year-old boy who was killed for having delivered a letter from Bahá’u’lláh to the
shah in July 1869; Mullá ‘Alí Ján of Máhfurúzak (See: ‘Alavíyyih Khánum, and ‘Alí Ján, Mullá); and the
poet Mírzá ‘Alí- Muhammad Varqá, whom ‘Abdu’l-Bahá appointed posthumously a Hand of the Cause of
God, and his twelve-year-old son, Rúhu’lláh, both killed in May 1896. The main sites used for
executions in Tehran in the period were the Sabzih Maydán and the Maydán Pá Qápúq (later Maydán I
‘dám).

Against this dark background of persecution, the Bahá’í community in Tehran and environs continued to
grow. The Bahá’í Faith spread to a number of villages in the area surrounding the capital. In Táliqán the
deputy governor Iskandar Khán and his son Mírzá Muhammad-‘Alí, who succeeded him, were Bahá’ís.
Through the governor, a resident named Mírzá ‘Abdu’r-Rahím became a Bahá’í. He, in turn, taught
others, including some of the ulama (Muslim religious leaders) of Táliqán and of the nearby village of
Fashandak.

In the last decades of the nineteenth century, many learned and eloquent Bahá’ís from various parts of
the country established themselves in the capital city, including Ibn Abhar; Ibn Asdaq; Hájí Ákhund;
Hájí Mírzá Haydar-‘Alí Isfahání; Áqá Jamál Burújirdí; Sadru’s-Sudúr; Mírzá Hasan Adíb; Mírzá Abu’l-Fadl;
prominent poet-teachers Muhammad Na’ím, Nayyir, and Síná; and Nabíl Qá’iní.3 As part of an institution
that came to be known as the muballigh (teacher-proclaimer), they undertook regular journeys to teach
the Bahá’í Faith, traveling from Tehran throughout Iran and to nearby countries.

Other institutional developments that germinated in
Tehran include the establishment of a local administrative
council and the beginnings of the institution of the Hands
of the Cause of God. During the last years of His life,
between 1887 and 1892, Bahá’u’lláh named four
individual Bahá’ís, all at that time residents of Tehran, as
Hands of the Cause, thus establishing an institution the
full significance of which did not become apparent for
more than half a century.

In 1897 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá instructed the four Hands to
convene a meeting of a group of prominent Bahá’ís of
Tehran. This meeting evolved into an embryonic local
administrative council, the Central Assembly of Tehran,
which became an elected body in 1899 and was the
predecessor of both the Spiritual Assembly of Tehran and
the National Spiritual Assembly of Iran (See:
Administration, Bahá’í.Institutions of Bahá’í
Administration.Local Spiritual Assemblies; and
Institutions of Bahá’í Administration.National Spiritual
Assemblies). A significant feature of that first elected
body was that its membership included one person of          Persian and American Bahá’ís, Tehran, c. 1912. L. to r.

origin. Although women were not included in the
membership of these early assemblies, a Committee for the Advancement of Bahá’í Women, which was

established in Tehran around 1910 and continued until 1917, provided opportunities for women to
participate in the administrative processes of the Bahá’í community.

Tehran gradually became the main center of a variety of Bahá’í activities in Iran. From about 1898 the
Bahá’ís of Tehran began to publish books by jellygraph and photo-offset methods. Around the same
time, Tehran became a focal point for the development of Bahá’í schools. The Tarbíyat Boys’ School
(established in 1900 and recognized by the government in 1903) and the Tarbíyat Girls’ School
(established in 1911) became noted for their exceptional academic caliber and admitted students of all
religious backgrounds and all social strata. The girls’ school was especially notable because educational
opportunities for Iranian girls, which had been virtually nonexistent at the beginning of the twentieth
century, were just beginning to be established.

Some of the boys and girls attending the Tarbíyat schools received scholarship assistance from the
Persian-American Educational Society, a charitable organization formally established in North America in
January 1910 as a result of efforts by a number of Iranian and American Bahá’ís. A young Bahá’í from
Tehran, Qudsíyyih Khánum Ashraf (Ghodsia Ashraf Khanum), the first Iranian woman to undertake
higher education in the West, addressed the society’s inaugural meeting in Washington DC in 1911. The
Bahá’í schools in Tehran later included a kindergarten, one of the first and best institutions of its kind in
Iran. In December 1934 the Ministry of Education closed the Tarbíyat schools because they refused to
open on Bahá’í holy days.

In 1910 a group of Bahá’í medical doctors in Tehran, including an American, Susan Moody, established
the Sehat Hospital. Dr. Moody, who opened her own private practice in 1909 to meet the needs of poor
women who could not afford to go to the hospital, was the hospital’s superintendent of women’s health
and trained Iranian women in midwifery and nursing. Her special efforts to bring modern health care to
the female population of the city were assisted by another American doctor, Sarah Clock, and a nurse,
Elizabeth Stewart, both of whom arrived in Tehran in 1911.

In 1914 Dr. Moody, who had also helped found the Tarbíyat School for Girls, spearheaded the
establishment of Bahá’í religious instruction classes for girls that paralleled the instruction already
available to boys. In 1917 interest in children’s education also led Muhammad Labib to establish
Nawnahálán, which was initially set up in Qazvin as a children's savings group and then moved its
headquarters to Tehran and became a national Bahá’í-owned financial organization. Bahá’í children were
encouraged to learn financial planning and to take responsibility for their future economic well-being by
making regular investments. Eventually, the company attracted investments by Bahá’ís throughout Iran.

REFERENCES TO TEHRAN IN THE BAHÁ’Í SACRED WRITINGS
The Bahá’í sacred writings include numerous references
to Tehran as a place of special import and as the
birthplace of a Manifestation of God. In His book the
Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’        the Báb refers to Tehran as "the
Sacred Land." Bahá’u’lláh apostrophizes Tehran in many

of His writings, conveying a great fondness for His native
city, which He describes as "the Abode of supreme
blissfulness" and "the holy and shining city."5 Following
His frequent practice of representing place names by
referring to their initial letter in the Persian alphabet, He A view of the city of Tehran, where Bahá’u’lláh was imprisoned

in 1852. Date: c. 1930. Photographer: Effie Baker. © Bahá’í
frequently calls Tehran the "Land of Tá." In the Kitáb-i-     International Community. Bahá’í Media Bank
Aqdas     (Most Holy Book), Bahá’u’lláh refers to the city
of Tehran, saying, "Rejoice with great joy, for God hath made thee 'the Dayspring of His light',
inasmuch as within thee was born the Manifestation of His Glory." 6 He also calls Tehran the "mother of
the World"7 and "the city in which the sweet savors of reunion have breathed." 8 "In thee," He states,

"the Unseen hath been revealed, and out of thee hath gone forth that which lay hid from the eyes of
men." 9

Perhaps the most well-known reference to Tehran in Bahá’u’lláh’s writings occurs in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas,
where He prophesies changes of government and an end to the persecution of the Bahá’ís of Iran:

> Let nothing grieve thee, O Land of Tá, for God hath chosen thee to be the source of
> the joy of all mankind. He shall, if it be His Will, bless thy throne with one who will
> rule with justice, who will gather together the flock of God which the wolves have
> scattered. Such a ruler will, with joy and gladness, turn his face towards, and extend
> his favours unto, the people of Bahá. . . . Erelong will the state of affairs within thee
> be changed, and the reins of power fall into the hands of the people. . . . The day is
> approaching when thy agitation will have been transmuted into peace and quiet
> calm. 10

Tehran is the site of many places that Bahá’ís throughout the world regard as holy. Among them are
locations associated with Bahá’u’lláh; the places where the remains of the Báb were kept; the house
where Táhirih was imprisoned and the garden where she was killed; and the Sabzih Maydán, where the
Seven Martyrs of Tehran were executed.
