Abdul-Baha

> Abdul-Baha was appointed by his father, Baha'u'llah, to be his successor as head of the
> Baha'i faith. He was named as the Center of the Covenant between Baha'u'llah and his
> followers, the perfect exemplar of the Baha'i teachings, and the authorized interpreter of
> the Baha'i scriptures. He carried out these functions from the death of his father in 1892

until his own death in 1921.

> Abdul-Baha was named Abbas Effendi at his birth in Tehran on May 23, 1844. He grew up
> during the turbulent years of the Babi upheavals in Iran, in which his father was much
> involved. In 1852, the whole family was exiled to Baghdad, Iraq, then to Istanbul and
> Edirne in Turkey, and finally to Akka (now in Israel). As he grew up, Abdul-Baha
> increasingly assumed responsibility for organizing the household, for supervising and vetting the stream of
> visitors and pilgrims who came to see his father, and for managing all contacts between the small community of
> exiles and government officials, thus leaving his father as free as possible to concentrate on dictating the words
> that would form the Baha'i scriptures. Even as a young man, he came to prominence because of his character,
> his grasp of mysticism and philosophy, and his ability to attract and inspire those whom he met. In later years,
> Professor E.G. Browne of Cambridge University described Abdul-Baha in this manner: "Seldom have I seen one
> whose appearance impressed me more. . . . One more eloquent of speech, more ready of argumentation, more
> apt of illustration, more intimately acquainted with the sacred books of the Jews, the Christians, and the
> Muhammadans, could, I should think, scarcely be found."

> When Abdul-Baha took over the leadership of the Baha'i faith in 1892, it was still a movement confined to the
> Middle East and India that consisted almost exclusively of Iranians. During his ministry, he expanded the reach of
> the religion to North and South America, Europe, East Asia, and Australasia. Through his two visits to Europe
> and North America (in 1911 and 1912–1913), he strengthened these nascent communities, spoke at numerous
> prestigious venues, and met many prominent persons, including religious leaders, philosophers, and statesmen.
> The newspapers of the time frequently referred to him as "the Persian prophet." Wherever there was a sufficiently
> large Baha'i community, he initiated the establishment of Baha'i administrative institutions.

> The writings of Abdul-Baha and the texts of the talks he gave during his journeys to the West have an important
> place in Baha'i literature. He kept up a voluminous correspondence with people, both Baha'is and others, from all
> parts of the world and wrote on philosophical, mystical, historical, social, and political themes. Still, Abdul-Baha
> suffered greatly during his life. It was not until he was 64 years old, in 1908, that the restrictions he had been
> under since going into exile in 1852 were finally lifted. On several occasions, his life was in great danger. He died
> in Haifa in modern-day Israel on November 28, 1921, and is buried in the Shrine of the Bab on Mount Carmel in
> Haifa.

> All accounts agree that Abdul-Baha had a charismatic personal presence that radiated a serene, majestic, and
> authoritative air. He was always very kind in his personal dealings and generous to the point that his own family

> members complained that they were left with nothing. He had a keen sense of humor and frequently used
> amusing anecdotes to make his point understood. His personal life was very simple and the furnishings of his
> rooms spartan. He ate and slept little and spent some hours every day in prayer and meditation. He was greatly
> venerated by the Baha'is and sometimes restrained them from making exaggerated claims about him. He always
> insisted that his highest station and greatest honor was to be Abdul-Baha ("the servant of Baha'u'llah").
