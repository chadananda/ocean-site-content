Hands of the Cause of God
(in Arabic: Ayádí Amru’lláh)
Administrative institution—established by Bahá’u’lláh and consisting of
individuals named by Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi—charged with
the functions of protecting and propagating the Bahá’í Faith; the generative body
for one of two parallel lines of responsibility in Bahá’í administration.

The electoral process begins at the grass roots
and culminates in the election of the Universal
House of Justice, the supreme council of the
Bahá’í Administrative Order (See: Administration,
Bahá’í.Institutions of Bahá’í Administration. The
Universal House of Justice), which has its seat at
the Bahá’í World Center in Haifa, Israel. The
members of the elected institutions function
corporately for a prescribed term of office.

The second line of responsibility, of which the
institution of the Hands of the Cause of God is
the generative body, consists of institutions
established by Shoghi Effendi and the Universal
House of Justice that function at the international, Hands of the Cause of God and members of the first Universal House of

continental, regional, and local levels (See:
Administration, Bahá’í.Institutions of Bahá’í Adminisration.The Institution of the Counselors). The
members, who are appointed, perform their duties in collaboration with the elected councils under the
guidance of the Head of the Bahá’í Faith (since 1963, the Universal House of Justice). Although these
appointed institutions have corporate functions at the international and, to a limited extent, the
continental levels, most of the work at the grass roots is accomplished through individual activity by the

members.

Bahá’u’lláh first mentioned the "Hands of the Cause" (the term "Hands of the Cause of God" is
frequently shortened to "Hands of the Cause" or "Hands") in 1887. In a letter addressed to Ibn Asdaq,
whom He later appointed a Hand of the Cause, Bahá’u’lláh asks God "to confirm the chosen ones, that
is those souls who are Hands of the Cause, who are adorned with the robe of teaching, and have arisen
to serve the Cause." 1 In other writings Bahá’u’lláh refers to "hands" to be raised up to assist Him in the
work of forwarding His cause 2 and also mentions their role in unifying and protecting the Bahá’í Faith.3
His Tablet of the World (Lawh-i-Dunyá ), revealed in 1891, includes a prayer or invocation for the
Hands of the Cause. 4 In the last few years of His life, He named as Hands of the Cause four
distinguished individuals, all living in Iran.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Bahá’u’lláh’s eldest son and appointed successor, guided the work of the four Hands, who
continued to function throughout most of the period during in which He was Head of the Faith (1892–
1921). They played a prominent role in protecting the Bahá’í Faith from attacks by supporters of Mírzá
Muhammad-‘Alí, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s younger half-brother, who challenged ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s authority as
Bahá’u’lláh’s chosen successor (See: ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.Life with Bahá’u’lláh, 1844-92.Exile and
Imprisonment, 1853-92). The Hands of the Cause also worked to bring elected Bahá’í institutions into
existence. In 1897 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá instructed them to form a consultative body, consisting of themselves
and other outstanding teachers, in Tehran, where they all resided at that time. Their efforts led to the
formation in 1899 of the first elected Bahá’í council in the world, of which they were members (See:
Tehran.The Bahá’í Period to 1921).

‘Abdu’l-Bahá honored several notable Iranian Bahá’ís who died before the end of the nineteenth century
by conferring the title Hand of the Cause on them posthumously. He appointed no living Hands of the
Cause. The four Hands appointed by Bahá’u’lláh and the four known to have been appointed
posthumously by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá do not necessarily constitute a complete list of the Hands of the Cause
from this early period. Shoghi Effendi clarifies that "The Hands of the Cause, of Bahá’u’lláh’s days, will

be known . . . when the history of the Cause in Persia and the Near East is written and available." 5 The
Research Department of the Universal House of Justice has observed that those conditions have not yet
been met. 6

Although ‘Abdu’l-Bahá appointed no living Hands of the Cause, He nonetheless laid the foundation for
the systematic development of the institution. In His Will and Testament , He confirms the institution
of the Hands of the Cause and establishes the institution of the Guardianship (See: Administration,
Bahá’í.Foundations of Bahá’í Administration.The Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice). He
gives the Guardian exclusive responsibility for appointing and directing the Hands of the Cause: "The
Hands of the Cause of God must be nominated and appointed by the guardian of the Cause of God. . . .
This body of the Hands of the Cause of God is under the direction of the guardian of the Cause of God.
He must continually urge them to strive and endeavor to the utmost of their ability to diffuse the sweet
savors of God, and to guide all the peoples of the world, for it is the light of Divine Guidance that
causeth all the universe to be illumined."7

‘Abdu’l-Bahá defines in considerable detail the duties and functions of the Hands of the Cause and their
relationship to the Guardianship. "The obligations of the Hands of the Cause of God," He states, "are to
diffuse the Divine Fragrances, to edify the souls of men, to promote learning, to improve the character
of all men and to be, at all times and under all conditions, sanctified and detached from earthly things.
They must manifest the fear of God by their conduct, their manners, their deeds and their words."8 He
also stresses their protective function. They are to be "ever watchful"—alert to any who might oppose
the Guardian or claim authority for themselves.9

Although ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament was released to the Bahá’í community shortly after His
passing in November 1921, His grandson Shoghi Effendi, the designated Guardian, did not immediately

initiate any major development of the institution of the Hands of the Cause. During the next three
decades, while guiding the expansion of the Bahá’í Faith and the extension of the network of elected
Bahá’í councils (Local and National Spiritual Assemblies) throughout the world, Shoghi Effendi continued
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s practice of making posthumous appointments. He named ten outstanding individuals
Hands of the Cause. Representing the diversity of the Bahá’í membership during the period, they were
men and women; Iranian, Egyptian, Iraqi, British, and American; white and black; of Muslim and
Christian background. All had made extraordinary contributions to the development of the Bahá’í Faith
as a worldwide community (See: Dunn, Clara, and Dunn, John Henry Hyde; Gregory, Louis George; and
Ransom-Kehler, Keith).

APPOINTMENT OF THE FIRST AND SECOND CONTINGENTS
On 24 December 1951 Shoghi Effendi cabled the Bahá’ís of the world, announcing that he had taken
the "long inevitably deferred step in conformity with provisions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Testament" of naming
twelve individuals Hands of the Cause, "equally allocated Holy Land [i.e., the Bahá’í World Center],
Asiatic, American, European continents"10 .

A few months later, on 29 February 1952, Shoghi Effendi appointed a second contingent of seven,
bringing the total to nineteen. In this contingent he included residents of Africa and Australia (See:
Dunn, Clara, and Dunn, John Henry Hyde), further extending the institution’s geographic range, and
added to its diversity of background by choosing two individuals of Jewish descent (See: Schopflocher,
Siegfried).

In effect, because neither ‘Abdu’l-Bahá nor Shoghi Effendi established a term of service for the Hands of
the Cause, appointment was for the individual’s lifetime. Unless they were retired or had independent
means, the Hands of the Cause usually continued to work in their professions and to fulfill other Bahá’í
administrative responsibilities to which they were elected or appointed. Many were members of National
Spiritual Assemblies before the Universal House of Justice announced in November 1964 their
ineligibility for election or appointment to administrative roles because of their "exalted rank" and
"specific functions" as Hands of the Cause and because of their wish, affirmed by the House of Justice,
to "be free to devote their entire energies to the vitally important duties conferred on them." 11

Although Shoghi Effendi would later describe the twofold responsibility of the Hands of the Cause as
"the propagation and preservation of the unity of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh,"12 for the first five years he
assigned the Hands tasks related only to their role in spreading the Bahá’í Faith. During the Ten Year
Plan (1953–63), a comprehensive expansion program of worldwide scope, he allocated to the Hands of

the Cause the role of "standard-bearers" of the plan. 13 He asked five Hands to serve as his
representatives at four intercontinental conferences he convoked in 1953 to launch the new plan, which
included among its goals quadrupling the number of National and Regional Spiritual Assemblies, from
twelve to forty-eight. As new Assemblies were formed (sixteen new Regional and National Assemblies as
of October 1957, with thirteen formed in that year alone), Shoghi Effendi dispatched a Hand of the
Cause to represent him at each Assembly formation.

In early 1952, when he announced the appointment of the second contingent of Hands, Shoghi Effendi
first alluded to the creation of institutions directed by the Hands that would parallel "those revolving
around the Universal House of Justice."14 A year earlier, in January 1951, he had appointed an
International Bahá’í Council, initiating the process that would lead to the election of the Universal House
of Justice. The Hands of the Cause played a central role in the process, as they had in establishing the
first elected council in Tehran half a century earlier. Among the International Bahá’í Council’s initial
members were three who would soon be appointed Hands, and in 1957 five of its nine members were
Hands (See: Bahá’í World Center.Development under Shoghi Effendi).

Shoghi Effendi took another step late in 1952 that further developed the administrative institutions
revolving around the Hands of the Cause. To facilitate their work as "chosen instruments for the
propagation of the Faith," he called on them to appoint nine-member Auxiliary Boards for the African,
American, Asiatic, Australian, and European continents, beginning in April 1954, to serve as their
"adjuncts, or deputies," and to work "in conjunction with the various National Spiritual Assemblies
functioning on each continent."15 He also established five Continental Funds to advance the work of the
Hands of the Cause and the Auxiliary Boards and named a Hand as Trustee for each Continental Fund.

Over the next three years, the institution of the Hands of the Cause developed in ways that served as
models for future functioning. The Auxiliary Board members, reporting to the Hands of the Cause, made
systematic visits to Bahá’í communities to encourage the prompt execution of the Ten Year Plan. The
individual Hands of the Cause, in turn, advised the National Assemblies in their respective areas and
also sent reports to the Hands of the Cause serving at the Bahá’í World Center, who functioned as
liaison between them and the Guardian.

INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND APPOINTMENT OF A THIRD
CONTINGENT
On 4 June 1957, advising the Bahá’ís of the world that the institution of the Hands of the Cause was
beginning a "new phase in the process of the unfoldment of its sacred mission," Shoghi Effendi enlarged
the scope of its responsibilities. He called on the Hands, in addition to assisting in prosecuting the Ten
Year Plan, to undertake "in close collaboration" with the National Assemblies "the primary obligation to
watch over and insure protection to the Bahá’í world community." 16

Protection within the context of the Bahá’í teachings has as its ultimate purpose preserving the Bahá’í
Faith’s unity, the integrity of its institutions as ordained by Bahá’u’lláh and further delineated by ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá and Shoghi Effendi, and the authenticity of its scripture. Shoghi Effendi’s 4 June 1957 letter was a
strongly worded summons that appeared to foreshadow a new round of attacks on the Bahá’í Faith
from adversaries of the Bahá’í community, both within and without. Shoghi Effendi called for "closer
association of the Hands of the five continents" with the National and Regional Spiritual Assemblies in
their areas. On such effort, he stated, depended "the spiritual health of the Bahá’í communities, the
vitality of the faith of its individual members, the proper functioning of its laboriously erected
institutions, the fruition of its worldwide enterprises, the fulfilment of its ultimate destiny."17

At the beginning of October 1957, Shoghi Effendi announced a further expansion of the institution. "In
view of the recent assumption by them of their sacred responsibility as protectors of the Faith," he
authorized the Hands of the Cause to appoint a second Auxiliary Board on each continent. This Board

was to be "equal in membership to the existing one, and charged with the specific duty of watching
over the security of the Faith, thereby complementing the function of the original Board, whose duty
will henceforth be exclusively concerned with assisting the prosecution of the Ten-Year Plan." In this
same message he appointed a third contingent of eight Hands of the Cause, bringing the total of living
Hands to twenty-seven. Addressing them as the "Chief Stewards of Bahá’u’lláh’s embryonic World
Commonwealth," he further widened their diversity to include a member of the Báb’s kindred (who are
known by the term Afnán [Arabic: Twigs]), an Australian, and a sub-Saharan African. 18 Three of the
new Hands resided on the African continent, strengthening the allocation to a region where the Bahá’í
Faith was expanding rapidly. Over the years, the Hands’ geographic distribution, which had already
changed as individuals died or relocated because of altered needs in the continents or at the Bahá’í
World Center, or because of health and other personal reasons, would remain comprehensive but
flexible.

Shoghi Effendi also convoked five intercontinental conferences to be held in 1958 to celebrate the

progress made in the plan and to deliberate on ways and means to complete it successfully. Again, he
named five Hands of the Cause to act as his "special representatives" at the conferences.19

Shoghi Effendi’s October 1957 letter proved to be his final message to the Bahá’ís of the world. A few
weeks later, on 4 November 1957, he passed away suddenly at the age of sixty, having suffered a
heart attack while recuperating in London from a bout of influenza. He was interred there on 9
November, with eighteen Hands of the Cause present among the mourners. The Hands of the Cause
conferred and decided to hold a meeting of the entire body immediately at the Bahá’í World Center.

nine of the Hands of the Cause inspected the premises to
assure that nothing had been removed and to search for a will. Finding none, they issued a statement:
"That the safe and desk have been opened and searched and the nonexistence of a Will and Testament
executed by Shoghi Effendi was definitely established." 21

Meanwhile, twenty-five Hands of the Cause had gathered at the Bahá’í World Center for their first
institutional meeting, or conclave, which was held from 18 to 25 November. A twenty-sixth Hand, Clara
Dunn, then in her late eighties, traveled to Haifa from Australia but was prevented by age and frail
health from participating in the meeting. The twenty-seventh, Corinne True, was unable at the age of
ninety-six to make the long trip from her home near Chicago.

The purpose of the conclave was to consider the status of the religion and the sudden, heavy
responsi¬bilities that had descended on the Hands of the Cause with no living Guardian to guide them.
Still stunned and grief-stricken, many meeting one another for the first time, the Hands gathered in the
large upstairs hall of the Mansion at Bahjí, Bahá’u’lláh’s home during the final years of His life.

Those present ranged in age from thirty-one to eighty-four. Their experiences as Bahá’ís were equally
wide-ranging: one of their number had been in the presence of Bahá’u’lláh, several had been Bahá’ís
since the time of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and a few were relatively recent converts to the Faith. The most
experienced had been appointed not quite six years earlier, and eight had served for just two months.
At the time only two of the Hands of the Cause from Iran were bilingual in English and Persian, the
most widely spoken languages among the members, and only one of the Western Hands of the Cause
spoke Persian. Thus the body’s deliberations, which would have been challenging even without the
language barrier, had to be fully translated into both English and Persian.

After just a week, the conclave produced its first statement. On 25 November 1957 the twenty-six
Hands of the Cause, with Clara Dunn participating as a signatory, issued a unanimous proclamation
confirming that Shoghi Effendi had left no heir and had not appointed another Guardian to succeed
him. Having carefully examined ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament and various messages from Shoghi
Effendi pertaining to the development of the institutions of the Bahá’í Faith, the Hands of the Cause

constituted a body of nine from among their number, as called for in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament,
to serve in the Holy Land and to act as Custodians of the Bahá’í Faith. Corinne True added her
signature to this proclamation by affidavit on 30 November 1957. All National and Regional Assemblies,
on receiving information about this action, pledged their "full support, faith and allegiance" to the
Custodians. 22 The civil authorities in Israel also gave the Custodians official recognition.

The duties of the Custodians, who functioned without officers and with a quorum of five, included taking
care of Bahá’í World Center properties and other assets; corresponding with and advising National and
Regional Spiritual Assemblies; acting on behalf of the Bahá’í Faith for its protection; and maintaining
close contact with the rest of the Hands, who would henceforth devote their time to the successful
completion of the goals of the Ten Year Plan. The Hands of the Cause maintained the number of
Custodians, replacing those who died or were unable, for health or personal reasons, to remain at the
Bahá’í World Center permanently. Those who served as Custodians, some for limited periods, were:
Hasan Balyuzi, Amelia Collins, Abu’l-Qasim Faizi, John Ferraby, Ali Akbar Furutan, Paul Haney, Leroy
Ioas, Jalal Khazeh, Adelbert Mühlschlegel, Charles Mason Remey, Horace Holley, William Sears, and
Rúhíyyih Khánum. To maintain the quorum of five Custodians at the Bahá’í World Center, the Hands
appointed alternates or substitute Custodians. Their numbers included Shuaullah Alai, Ugo Giachery,
and Ali-Muhammad Varqa, as well as several who also served as permanent Custodians for some time.

A conclave of the Hands of the Cause took place annually in the Holy Land (with the exception of 1962)
until April 1963, when the last conclave was held just before the election of the Universal House of
Justice, which ended the interregnum. The conclaves from 1957 to 1961 each sent a full and detailed
message to the Bahá’ís of the world.

In 1959, only two years after taking up their assigned protective role, the Hands of the Cause faced a
serious threat to the unity of the Bahá’í Faith. It came from an unexpected source: Charles Mason
Remey, a colleague who had until recently served as a Custodian. A distinguished Bahá’í since the time
of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the architect of several Bahá’í Houses of Worship (See: Mashriqu’l-Adhkár.Houses
of Worship around the World.Kampala; Houses of Worship around the World.Sydney; and Future Plans),
Remey had been among the first Hands of the Cause appointed in 1951. Shoghi Effendi had also
appointed him president of the International Bahá’í Council in 1952. Despite being in his mid-eighties,
Remey had served as a Custodian from November 1957 through October 1959, when he and Hasan
Balyuzi—both unable to continue as permanent members—were replaced. In April 1960, a few months
after leaving Haifa, Remey made a sudden claim to be the second Guardian, although he had signed
the 25 November 1957 proclamation in which the Hands of the Cause stated that Shoghi Effendi had
not appointed a successor. Moreover, Remey was not a "branch," or descendant of Bahá’u’lláh, as
specified in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament, and could thus not have been named Guardian by
Shoghi Effendi.23 On 28 April 1960 the Hands of the Cause in the Holy Land cabled an announcement of
Remey’s "PREPOSTEROUS CLAIM " and called on Bahá’ís everywhere to repudiate completely "THIS
MISGUIDED ACTION ."24

Remey’s claim was immediately rejected by the International Bahá’í Council; all the Hands of the
Cause; all National Spiritual Assemblies except that of France, five of whose members supported
Remey; and the vast majority of Bahá’ís around the world. The Custodians dissolved the National
Spiritual Assembly of France and called for a new election. In July 1960—having found that Remey’s
actions were the result of "a persistent and well-thought-out campaign," rather than "the evidence of a
great emotional disturbance and unbalance," perhaps temporary, as they had at first thought25 —the
entire body of the Hands of the Cause expelled Remey from the Bahá’í Faith on the grounds that he
had broken Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant, which establishes clear guidelines for the succession of authority.

Undeterred by Remey’s defection, the Hands of the Cause persevered in carrying out Shoghi Effendi’s
vision. He had left detailed plans to guide the development of the Bahá’í Faith until the end of the Ten

Year Plan in 1963. At a meeting held in November 1959, the Hands of the Cause decided it would be
necessary to elect the Universal House of Justice at the end of the plan. They gave primary
consideration to the instructions in Shoghi Effendi’s cablegram of 9 January 1951, in which he appointed
the International Bahá’í Council as the beginning of a process leading to the election of the Universal
House of Justice. The Hands of the Cause initiated the second stage of the process by calling for the
Council to be elected by the existing National and Regional Spiritual Assemblies. This first international
Bahá’í election was carried out by postal ballot in April 1961.

message disseminated to the Bahá’ís of the world. 27

For six years, from 1957 to 1963, the Hands of the Cause of God maintained the unity and integrity of
the Bahá’í Faith and led its unprecedented expansion during the Ten Year Plan. The Universal House of
Justice paid tribute to them in its first message, addressed to more than six thousand Bahá’ís gathered
in London for the first Bahá’í World Congress, 28 April–2 May 1963. Calling the occasion, which marked
the centenary of Bahá’u’lláh’s declaration of His mission and celebrated the completion of the Ten Year
Plan, "the crowning victory of the lifework of Shoghi Effendi," the Universal House of Justice also paid
tribute to the Hands of the Cause: "For they share the victory with their beloved commander, who
raised them up and appointed them. They kept the ship on its course and brought it safe to port." 28 On
7 June 1963 the Hands of the Cause in the Holy Land performed their last action as Custodians when
they officially transferred their authority to the Universal House of Justice, stating that "the office of
Custodians of the Bahá’í World Faith has thus ceased to exist."29

EXTENDING THE FUNCTIONS OF THE HANDS OF THE CAUSE INTO THE
FUTURE
In 1964, with twenty-two remaining Hands of the Cause, five fewer than at the time of Shoghi Effendi’s
death, the Universal House of Justice inaugurated a nine-year global plan that named as one of its
primary goals the "development of the Institution of the Hands of the Cause of God, in consultation
with the body of the Hands of the Cause, with a view to the extension into the future of its appointed
functions of protection and propagation."30 Following a fourteen-day gathering of the Hands of the
Cause at the Bahá’í World Center in November 1964, the House of Justice advised the Bahá’ís of the
world that it had found "no way to appoint, or to legislate to make it possible to appoint, Hands of the
Cause of God," this being the prerogative of the Guardianship.31

The Universal House of Justice further stated that "Responsibility for decisions on matters of general
policy affecting the Institution of the Hands of the Cause," which had been carried out formerly by
Shoghi Effendi, "now devolves upon the Universal House of Justice as the supreme and central
institution of the Faith."32 In line with that responsibility, the Universal House of Justice announced
several initial decisions. It refined the continental zones to which the Hands of the Cause were
assigned, increased the number of Auxiliary Board members, and freed the Hands of the Cause and

their Auxiliary Board members from service in other appointed or elected positions.33

A major step in the evolution of the institution of the Hands of the Cause occurred in June 1968. To
carry forward the functions of the Hands of the Cause, the Universal House of Justice established
eleven Continental Boards of Counselors—for Australasia (Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea,
and the islands of the Pacific), Europe, and three zones each in Africa, the Americas, and Asia—and
appointed thirty-six individuals to serve as Counselors (See: Administration, Bahá’í.Institutions of Bahá’í
Administration.The Institution of the Counselors). The Hands of the Cause in the Holy Land became the
liaison between the Universal House of Justice and the Counselors.

The Universal House of Justice subsequently redefined the continental zones, increased the number of
Counselors, and established five-year terms of service. Currently, a total of eighty-one Counselors serve
on five Continental Boards: Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australasia, and Europe.

In June 1973 the Universal House of Justice announced
another major institutional development, the formation at
the Bahá’í World Center of the International Teaching
Center (See: Administration, Bahá’í.Institutions of Bahá’í
Administration.The Institution of the Counselors). This
step, taken with the assistance of the Hands of the
Cause in the Holy Land, "brings to fruition the work of
the Hands of the Cause residing in the Holy Land and
provides for its extension into the future," the Universal
House of Justice stated, "links the institution of the
Boards of Counselors even more intimately with that of
the Hands of the Cause of God, and powerfully reinforces

Counselors at the grassroots level by authorizing Auxiliary Board members to appoint assistants to work
with Local Spiritual Assemblies, groups, and individuals.

The operating nucleus of the International Teaching Center at its inception in 1973 included the four
Hands of the Cause resident in Haifa at that time: Rúhíyyih Khánum, Abu’l-Qasim Faizi, Ali Akbar
Furutan, and Paul Haney. The Universal House of Justice also appointed three Counselor members, a
number that would grow over the years to the current total of nine. All Hands of the Cause—a total at
that time of seventeen—were members of the International Teaching Center, receiving and sending
reports and, when in Haifa, joining its deliberations when they wished. "Through the emergence of this
Center," the House of Justice states, "the seal has been set on the accomplishment of the goal . . . of
ensuring the extension into the future of the specific functions of protection and propagation conferred
upon the Hands of the Cause in the Sacred Text. Through the work of the International Teaching
Center, which supervises and coordinates the work of the Boards of Counselors around the world, the
love, the guidance, the assistance of the Hands, through the Boards of Counselors, their Auxiliary
Board members and their assistants, permeates the entire structure of Bahá’í society." 35

WORLDWIDE ACTIVITIES AFTER 1963
Under the guidance of the Universal House of Justice, the Hands of the Cause who resided at the Bahá’í
World Center fulfilled special duties, as needed, to protect the religion. At the request of the Universal
House of Justice, they also continued to arrange for pilgrimages to the Bahá’í World Center until the
responsibility could be taken on by the staff of the Universal House of Justice.

The remaining Hands of the Cause, reassigned to the five continents, carried out an array of activities.

They consulted with National Spiritual Assemblies; supervised the work of the Auxiliary Boards; visited
Bahá’í communities; attended conferences and other gatherings; and represented the Bahá’í Faith in
meetings with dignitaries.

Nepal; and Ugo Giachery, an Italian, who died in Western
Samoa—journeyed from their home continents to an extraordinary number of locales around the world.

Over the years, no one traveled more extensively than Shoghi Effendi’s widow, Rúhíyyih Khánum.
During the interregnum between Shoghi Effendi’s death and the election of the Universal House of
Justice, her responsibilities as a Custodian occupied much of her time. In 1964, however, she was able
to begin traveling systematically, eventually visiting 185 countries and territories, some repeatedly.
Among her most extensive journeys were four lengthy trips between 1969 and 1973 through sub-
Saharan Africa (known as her Great Safari); a six-month Green Light Expedition through South
America, February–August 1975, which she recorded on film and during which she visited indigenous
peoples of the Amazon basin and the Andes; eight- and seven-month-long trips through Asia and the
Pacific in 1978 and 1984; and four months of travel throughout the former Soviet Union in 1993. In
1996 she spent a month in Brazil, where the Bahá’í community was commemorating its seventy-fifth
anniversary. During this visit, she represented the Bahá’í World Center at a special session of the
Brazilian Chamber of Deputies, met with the president of the country at his palace, visited locales in the
north and south of the nation, and traveled to the Amazon to commemorate the twentieth anniversary
of the Green Light expedition. In 1997, a little more than two years before her death at the age of
eighty-nine, she participated in events in Luxembourg, Spain, and Switzerland.

In their journeys and at the Bahá’í World Center, the Hands of the Cause met innumerable religious
leaders, including the Dalai Lama; presidents, prime ministers, and other heads of state; and members
of royalty and dignitaries ranging from Prince Philip Mountbatten, the Duke of Edinburgh, to United
Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar. Ugo Giachery, born into an aristocratic family on the
island of Sicily, had a particularly close relationship with His Highness Malietoa Tanumafili II, Head of
State of Western Samoa, the first reigning monarch to become a Bahá’í. In addition to participating in

official meetings with dignitaries, several of the Hands engaged in sensitive negotiations with
governments on behalf of the Bahá’í Faith.

Hands of the Cause continued to represent the Universal
House of Justice, as they had Shoghi Effendi, at the
formation of new National Spiritual Assemblies in every
continent, at international and regional Bahá’í
conferences, and at foundation ceremonies for Houses of
Worship and dedication ceremonies marking their
completion. These activities gradually decreased as the
number of Hands of the Cause able to travel was
reduced by illness and death.

In 1973 sixteen of the seventeen surviving Hands were
able to function actively. The next decade saw the loss of
seven Hands of the Cause, including the two youngest,
and the following decade another seven. In November
1992 the three surviving Hands—Rúhíyyih Khánum, Ali
Akbar Furutan, and Ali-Muhammad Varqa—addressed the          A historical photograph of the Hand of the Cause of God Enoch

Second Bahá’í World Congress in New York City at which       Community. Bahá’í Media Bank
some twenty-seven thousand Bahá’ís gathered.

Many Hands of the Cause participated actively in International Bahá’í Conventions held in Haifa at five-
year intervals from 1963 until 1998 (the convention in April 2003 was canceled because of world events
affecting travel) and in conferences of the Continental Counselors held after the international
conventions and on separate occasions in December 1985–January 1986 and December 1995. In
January 2001 a conference attended by nearly one thousand Counselors and Auxiliary Board members
from 172 countries commemorated the inauguration of the newly constructed seat of the International
Teaching Center (See: Bahá’í World Center.Development under the Universal House of Justice). The two
surviving Hands of the Cause—Ali Akbar Furutan and Ali-Muhammad Varqa—were invited to address
the conference, which marked the first such worldwide gathering of the members of the institution
created to perpetuate their work.

LASTING INFLUENCE
The Hands of the Cause exerted a profound impact on the lives of thousands of Bahá’ís and others who
met them or heard them speak throughout the globe and at the Bahá’í World Center. These individuals
in turn, by sharing their personal reminiscences, continue to affect others who never had the
opportunity to meet the Hands of the Cause.

All the Hands of the Cause were effective communicators, and many were particularly talented as public
speakers. Dorothy Baker, for example, a veteran lecturer at American colleges and before diverse
audiences in the United States and Latin America, was regarded as one of the best Bahá’í speakers in
the United States. Rúhíyyih Khánum, who spoke French and Persian as well as her native English, gave
talks in an engagingly direct, extemporaneous style. Ali Akbar Furutan was an eloquent speaker whose
mastery of Persian was legendary. Abu’l-Qasim Faizi—another excellent speaker fluent in Persian,
Arabic, French, and English—was erudite but humorous, authoritative but humble. William Sears, who
had worked professionally in both radio and television, captured the attention of audiences around the
world and regularly brought them to both tears and laughter.

In their addresses to Bahá’ís, individual Hands of the Cause often focused on themes with which they
were particularly associated. Zikrullah Khadem conveyed a profound love of Shoghi Effendi; John
Robarts inspired or rekindled commitment to the power of prayer; Collis Featherstone, punctuating his

talks with humor, quoted from the Bahá’í writings and encouraged his listeners to study them. The
Hands of the Cause developed deep personal bonds with individuals and maintained the connection, in
many cases, through an extensive personal correspondence with people in all parts of the world.

appeared in 1958. Hermann Grossmann—who had been writing about the Bahá’í Faith since the 1920s

—published additional works, including Was ist die Bahá’í Religion? (What is the Bahá’í Religion?) and
Der Bahá'í-Glaubige und die Bahá'í Gemeinschaft (The Bahá’í Believer and the Bahá’í Community).39 He
also translated writings by Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá into German.

Rúhíyyih Khánum Rabbani published a popular introductory book called Prescription for Living in 1950.40
As a Hand of the Cause, she wrote several more books; a humorous play called A Spiritual Assembly’s
Growing Pains;41 and a volume of poetry about the loss of Shoghi Effendi.42 Her seminal biography of
Shoghi Effendi, The Priceless Pearl, was first published in 1969.43 She also compiled The Ministry of the
Custodians, 1957–1963, a collection of documents produced by the Hands of the Cause during the
interregnum, to which she contributed a short but historically invaluable introduction.44 In addition to
her film The Green Light Expedition, she directed and produced another documentary called The
Pilgrimage, which introduced viewers to the shrines and holy sites at the Bahá’í World Center. 45

Hasan Balyuzi, unable to travel after 1963 because of ill health, concentrated on scholarly research and
writing, to which he would make major contributions until his death in 1980. His works include major
biographies of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá; Edward Granville Browne and the Bahá’í Faith;
Eminent Bahá’ís in the Time of Bahá’u’lláh; and Muhammad and the Course of Islám.46

Abu’l-Qasim Faizi wrote a variety of articles and books, including a biography of Amelia Collins, one of
the Hands of the Cause with whom he worked closely.47 Works in English that he translated into Persian
include letters written by Shoghi Effendi and Rúhíyyih Khánum’s The Priceless Pearl. He also translated
works from Persian into English.

Ugo Giachery penned a memoir called Shoghi Effendi: Recollections.48 Adelbert Mühlschlegel wrote
poetry in German. Ali Akbar Furutan engaged in scholarly research and wrote articles and books in
Persian, some of which have been translated into English and other languages, including Mothers,
Fathers, and Children: A Practical Guide to Parenting and a personal memoir, The Story of My Heart.49

William Sears coproduced a television series on the Bahá’í Faith, recorded talks, gave dramatic
presentations, and continued to produce a stream of popular books, including Release the Sun, a
history of the Bábí movement; Thief in the Night, which deals with the fulfillment of biblical prophecies;
God Loves Laughter, a humorous biographical account; and A Cry from the Heart: The Bahá’ís in Iran, a

personal response to persecution of the Bahá’ís following the Islamic Revolution in 1978–79.50

Despite his advanced age, Tarazullah Samandari, who had met Bahá’u’lláh, not only journeyed widely
throughout the Northern Hemisphere from 1953 until his death in 1968, but, because of his expertise
as an authority on the handwriting of Bahá’u’lláh and His amanuenses, also assisted the Universal
House of Justice with identifying and classifying archival manuscripts and letters. Rahmátu’lláh Muhájir
also helped to catalog sacred texts at the Bahá’í World Center. Over a period of five years in the 1970s,
Zikrullah Khadem compiled in 137 volumes an international registry of Bahá’í holy places and historic
sites associated with the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, including places ‘Abdu’l-Bahá visited in
England and North America. Jalal Khazeh started a newsletter in Spanish that circulated throughout
Latin America. Ali-Muhammad Varqa assisted the Universal House of Justice by compiling accounts of
the early history of Bahá’í communities around the world.

After 1995 all three surviving Hands of the Cause resided in Haifa. Thus, although age and health
gradually curtailed their travels, they were able to interact with workers at the Bahá’í World Center—a
large proportion of whom are youth volunteers from around the world—and with pilgrims and visitors.
Rúhíyyih Khánum spoke annually to an average of two thousand pilgrims who visited the House of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá (See: Bahá’í World Center.Early Development), where she resided from her marriage to
Shoghi Effendi in 1937 until her death in 2000. Literally until the end of his life, Ali Akbar Furutan
addressed pilgrims and visitors and, almost every evening, conversed with them informally at the
Pilgrim House and the Reception Center near the Shrine of the Báb (See: Bahá’í World
Center.Development under the Universal House of Justice); at the conclusion of one such evening, on
26 November 2003, he died suddenly at the age of ninety-eight.

When Ali-Muhammad Varqa became a Hand of the Cause in
1955, he succeeded his father both as a Hand and as the
Trustee of Huqúqu’lláh (Arabic: the Right of God). An institution
established by Bahá’u’lláh in His book of laws, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas

(Most Holy Book), Huqúqu’lláh provides for payment by
Bahá’ís, as a private act of conscience, of a percentage of
accumulated savings, after the deduction of essential expenses
and exempt properties, to a fund at the disposition of the Head
of the Faith. The law was binding only on Bahá’ís from the
Middle East until 1992, when the Universal House of Justice
made it applicable worldwide. Thus, as Trustee of Huqúqu’lláh,
Dr. Varqa oversaw major institutional developments in the
1990s: the establishment of a central office at the Bahá’í World
Center and the creation of an international network of deputies
and representatives who receive payments and systematically
educate Bahá’ís about the law.

university professor, a multilingual world citizen, a person of
distinguished bearing but abiding personal humility, he demonstrated in his own life the essential nature
of the institution of the Hands of the Cause, its evolution into an international institution since its
inception in the late nineteenth century, and its lasting influence on the Bahá’í world.

As early as April 1967, characterizing the services of the Hands of the Cause during that year as having
"shone with an unfailing light," the Universal House of Justice observed: "These few gallant and
dedicated believers, whose place in history is forever assured by virtue of their appointment to their
high office, are indeed a precious legacy left to us by our beloved Guardian, and as the years go by

there is increasingly added to the honor and respect which is their due, by reason of their exalted rank,
the love and admiration . . . evoked by their constant services." 51
