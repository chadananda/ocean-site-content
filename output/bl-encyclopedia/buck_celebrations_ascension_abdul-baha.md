A
‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Ascension of (November 28)

The Ascension of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, like the Day of the Covenant (November 26), is a
Bahá’ı́ holy day honoring ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (1844–1921), who succeeded Bahá’u’lláh
(1819–1892), prophet-founder of the Bahá’ı́ Faith, and led the Bahá’ı́ community
from 1892 to 1921. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá fulfilled a triple role, in that he was not only
Bahá’u’lláh’s designated successor, but was authorized by Bahá’u’lláh as the iner-
rant interpreter of the latter’s teachings and was also regarded as the paragon, or
perfect exemplar, of Bahá’ı́ ethics, virtues, and wisdom.

The Ascension of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá commemorates the death—and, retrospec-
tively, the life—of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who passed away quietly in his home on Novem-
ber 28, 1921, in Haifa, Palestine (now Israel), at the age of 77. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was
well known in Palestine and abroad. One instance of this will illustrate the point:
Immediately upon learning of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s death, Winston Churchill, then
British secretary of state for the colonies, telegraphed to the High Commissioner
for Palestine, Sir Herbert Samuel, who was the highest-ranking official in the
country, instructing him to “convey to the Bahai Community, on behalf of His
Majesty’s Government, their sympathy and condolence on the death of Sir ‘Abdu’l
Bahá ‘Abbas.” Here, reference to the title “Sir” refers to the knighthood of the Brit-
ish Empire that was conferred on ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at a ceremony in the garden of the
military governor of Haifa on April 17, 1920, for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s humanitarian
work in Palestine during World War I.

Arrangements for the funeral were made by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s sister, Bahı́yyih
Khánum. The funeral procession for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá took place on November 29,
1921\. An estimated 10,000 townspeople joined together in the procession,
acclaimed as the largest and most memorable funeral event the city of Haifa had
seen. The casket was carried from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s house, at the foot of Mount
Carmel, to a garden facing the Shrine of the Báb, approximately midway up the
northern slope of Mount Carmel. The procession itself took two hours for the cas-
ket to be carried a distance of just under a mile. Describing the procession, Shoghi
Effendi (1898–1957), grandson of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the Guardian of the Bahá’ı́
Faith (1921–1957), wrote, in part:

> The coffin containing the remains of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was borne to its last
> resting-place on the shoulders of His loved ones. The cortège which preceded
> it was led by the City Constabulary Force, acting as a Guard of Honor,

> behind which followed in order
> the Boy Scouts of the Muslim
> and Christian communities hold-
> ing aloft their banners, a company
> of Muslim choristers chanting
> their verses from the Qur’án, the
> chiefs of the Muslim community
> headed by the Muftı́, and a num-
> ber of Christian priests, Latin,
> Greek and Anglican. Behind the
> coffin walked the members of
> His family, the British High Com-
> missioner, Sir Herbert Samuel,
> the Governor of Jerusalem, Sir
> Ronald Storrs, the Governor of
> Phoenicia, Sir Stewart Symes,
> officials of the government, con-
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. (National Spiritual Assembly of the suls of various countries resident
Bahá’ı́s of the United States)                    in Haifa, notables of Palestine,

Muslim, Jewish, Christian and
> Druze, Egyptians, Greeks, Turks, Arabs, Kurds, Europeans and Americans,
> men, women and children. The long train of mourners, amid the sobs and moans
> of many a grief-stricken heart, wended its slow way up the slopes of Mt. Carmel
> to the Mausoleum of the Báb (Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, 313).

At the funeral ceremony itself, nine eulogies, eloquent and moving, were given
> by dignitaries representing the Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities. The
Mufti of Haifa, Shaykh Muhammad Murád, lamented the loss of Haifa’s great

˙
> benefactor: “Abdul-Baha was great in all the stages of his life. He was genius
> itself, high in character and had the best reputation. . . . To whom shall the poor
> now look? Who shall care for the hungry? and the desolate, the widow and the
> orphan?” (See Bagdadi, Star of the West [1922]; and Balyuzi, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
> 466–72.) ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had great compassion for the poor and ministered to their
needs practically every afternoon of his life in Haifa, even on his wedding day.

Bahı́yyih Khánum opened ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament to see if it con-
> tained any instructions for the burial. Since no specific instructions were given,
> she decided to inter him in a place of enduring honor. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s casket, after
> mourners had paid their respects, was interred in the Shrine of the Báb, in a vault
> beneath the floor of the north central room, next to the very room where the Báb’s
remains are entombed.

The governor of Jerusalem, Sir Ronald Storrs, commented: “I have never
known a more united expression of regret and respect than was called forth by

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Ascension of (November 28)            3

the utter simplicity of the ceremony.” Sir Herbert Samuel wrote: “A great throng
had gathered together, sorrowing for his death, but rejoicing also for his life”
(Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, 312).

For several days after, some 50 to 100 of the poor were fed each day at
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s house, culminating, on the seventh day, in a mass distribu-
tion of grain. On the 40th day after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s passing, a memorial
feast was held in accordance with Muslim customs, and additional eulogies
were given.

Obituaries were published in major newspapers in the Middle East, Europe, the
United States, and India, such as: Times (London), November 30, 1921 (“ ‘Abdul
Baha was a man of great spiritual power and commanding presence and his name
was held in reverence throughout the Middle East and elsewhere”); New York
World, December 1, 1921; Daily Mirror, December 2, 1921; Le Temps, the leading
French paper, December 19, 1921; Times of India, January 1922; and others.
Locally, the Haifa newspaper, Annafir (December 6, 1921), published an obituary
that carried the headline: “The Most Great Calamity—The Departure of the Per-
sonification of Humanitarianism, Abdul-Baha Abbas” (Bagdadi, Star of the West,
259–67).

The term “Ascension,” of Christian origin, is a reverential term, implying that
the person referred to, by virtue of a high spiritual station, “ascended” to heaven
and dwells in Paradise. For Bahá’ı́s, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, although not a prophet, occu-
pied a unique and pivotal station.

At such commemorations, Bahá’ı́s typically gather together in an assembly hall
or private home (depending on the size of the local Bahá’ı́ community) and, in a
dignified atmosphere, respectfully recite or chant prayers and passages from the
sacred Bahá’ı́ Writings. A special “Prayer revealed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and now
recited by his loved ones at his hallowed shrine” was translated by Shoghi Effendi
in January 1922. This “Tablet of Visitation” for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá captures the
quintessence of his character, expressed in this supplication: “Lord! Give me to
drink from the chalice of selflessness; with its robe clothe me, and in its ocean
immerse me.” For Bahá’ı́s, this prayer is especially significant by virtue of this
promise preceding the prayer: “Whoso reciteth this prayer with lowliness and fer-
vor will bring gladness and joy to the heart of this Servant; it will be even as meet-
ing Him face to face” (Bahá’ı́ Prayers, 234).

Abhidhamma Day

> Abhidhamma Day is a Theravada Buddhist celebration observed primarily in
> Myanmar (Burma) that has grown out of a tradition concerning the origins of the
> Abhidhamma, a major segment of the Pali Canon, the holy texts of Theravada
> Buddhism. The Abhidhamma literature is a collection of commentaries on the
> sutras, the books generally believed to be the discourses of the Buddha. One tradi-
> tion suggests that the Abhidhamma developed when the Buddha visited his
> deceased mother in Tusita heaven and taught her about the Dharma, during the
> Rainy Season Retreat (Vassa Retreat) seven years after his enlightenment. He
> did this each night, and during the next day, he repeated the same teachings to
> Sariputra. Sariputra memorized and recited the entire comments to his disciple,
> who in turn passed them down generation by generation until they were recited at
> the Third Council of Buddhism, held at Pataliputra in 251 BCE. At that time, all
seven books were recited accurately by Revata, and then later put in written form.

According to this tradition, following his enlightenment, the Buddha was filled
> with compassion for the various deities (devas) and brahmas were believed to
> dwell there. By this time, his mother, who had passed away shortly after his birth,
> had been reborn in the Tusita heaven, one of the heavenly realms in Buddhist cos-
> mology. There she was now known as Santusita Deva. He thus went to the celestial
> abode and preached the Abhidhamma to both his mother and the assembly of the
> heaven’s divine and semi-divine beings. The preaching activity continued for three
months.

When the Buddha completed his work in heaven, he asked permission of the king
> of the celestial realm to return to his work in the human realm. On hearing this, the
> king made available three stairways, one made of silver, one of gold, and one of ruby.
