Bahá’í World Center
Spiritual and administrative center of the Bahá’í Faith, established in the twin
cities of Acre and Haifa as a consequence of Bahá’u’lláh’s banishment to Palestine
in 1868. The Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh at Bahjí, just north of Acre, and the Shrine of
the Báb on the slope of Mount Carmel in Haifa, in a location chosen by
Bahá’u’lláh, are the focal points of devotion for Bahá’ís around the world. The
edifices of the administrative center are situated on Mount Carmel near the Shrine
of the Báb.

The prison city of Acre became the center of the Bahá’í Faith when Bahá’u’lláh arrived there on 31
August 1868 as an exile and a prisoner of the Ottoman authorities. He and His companions were taken
to the citadel, where they were confined for more than two years. On 3 September 1868 the text of
Sultan Abdülaziz’s order condemning Bahá’u’lláh and His companions to perpetual banishment and
forbidding the inhabitants of Acre from associating with the exiles was read out in the principal mosque
of the city as a warning to the population. The resultant hostility and suspicion of the populace
gradually gave way to respect for Bahá’u’lláh and for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who became increasingly
responsible for relations between the exiles and the public; conditions became easier and the attitude
of the local population more friendly. In October 1870 Bahá’u’lláh and His family were permitted to
move from the citadel to the first in a series of rented quarters in Acre. In June 1877, although
Bahá’u’lláh remained a prisoner, it became possible for Him to take up residence in pleasant
surroundings outside the city walls, first at Mazra‘ih and then at Bahjí, where He passed away in 1892.

regulated, however. The undercurrent of antagonism to the Bahá’í Faith as a result of rumors that had
been spread by its opponents, and the fact that the exiles remained prisoners of the government,
meant that a sudden influx of pilgrims could have alarmed the authorities and created grave danger for
the Faith. Bahá’u’lláh, therefore, required every pilgrim to obtain His permission before setting off on
the journey and to pause at Beirut or Alexandria, where trusted representatives resided, for this
permission to be confirmed before proceeding to Acre.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who continued to live in the city of Acre in a residence known as the House of ‘Abbúd,
increasingly undertook day-to-day arrangements such as renting houses, securing food, and meeting
with officials. Money to cover the expenses of the Bahá’ís came from a variety of sources. As was
customary for those exiled for political reasons, the Ottoman government provided a small allowance
for the maintenance of Bahá’u’lláh and those exiled with Him. This was later augmented by money that
the Bahá’ís in the Holy Land were able to earn through trade. Also, Bahá’ís from Iran and other centers
in the Middle East sent contributions and, later, payments of Huqúqu’lláh (Arabic: the "Right of God," a
law providing for payment, as a private act of conscience, of a percentage of one’s capital gains to a
fund at the disposition of the Head of the Faith). Despite this income, however, financial resources were
limited, and the exiles lived simply; a pilgrim who visited the Holy Land in the last months of
Bahá’u’lláh’s life records, for example, that the room in which Bahá’u’lláh lived at Bahjí was bare except
for a chair and reed matting on the floor. 2

Bahá’u’lláh arrived in Acre with sixty-six family members and companions. Over the years, numbers of
Bahá’ís, some driven from their homes by persecution, some wanting to be close to Bahá’u’lláh, settled
in the Acre–Haifa area. By the time of Bahá’u’lláh’s passing in 1892, these totaled about three hundred.
A few served in the household of Bahá’u’lláh and in the Garden of Ridván, a spot near Acre that
Bahá’u’lláh often visited, and in other gardens, but the majority took up occupations such as
shopkeepers, carpenters, and iron- and coppersmiths in Acre and Haifa. When, on Bahá’u’lláh’s
instructions, land was purchased on the Sea of Galilee, Mírzá Muhammad Qulí, Bahá’u’lláh’s half-
brother, moved to Nuqayb to farm a tract of land that had been assigned to him.

In 1896 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá rented the House of ‘Abdu’lláh Páshá
in Acre, both to receive pilgrims, who were now coming from Europe and America as well as from the
Middle East, and to house His growing extended family as His daughters began to marry. Later, from
about 1907, He began to move His family to Haifa, where He joined them in 1909 after His release
from incarceration. His house in Haifa, located on what is now known as Haparsim (Persian) Street at
the foot of Mount Carmel, became the administrative center of the Bahá’í Faith.

‘Abdu’l-Bahá had several secretaries who served Him in this capacity for varying lengths of time and
who helped Him with His correspondence. Usually, one secretary was fluent in English and assisted with
the correspondence received in that language. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá continued Bahá’u’lláh’s pattern of
corresponding with individual Bahá’ís. As the postal services in the Middle East improved, the need to
use Bahá’í couriers decreased.

One of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s main achievements in developing
the Bahá’í World Center—indeed, one of the greatest
achievements of His ministry 3—was the construction of
the Shrine of the Báb on Mount Carmel at a spot that
had been designated by Bahá’u’lláh. This was an
enterprise fraught with problems at every stage. ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá laid the foundation stone for the Shrine in 1899,
but construction continued for many years. On 21 March
1909 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá laid the remains of the Báb to rest in
a vault within the Shrine. Twelve years later, on 29
November 1921, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was buried in an adjacent

vault. Shoghi Effendi later enlarged the Shrine and         Israel. © Bahá’í International Community. Bahá’í Media Bank
completed the building by adding a superstructure (See
Section: Development under Shoghi Effendi).

From about 1909 onward, pilgrims were accommodated in Haifa. A pilgrim house built near the Shrine
of the Báb in 1909 by Mírzá Ja‘far Rahmání, a Bahá’í from Ashgabat in Turkmenistan, housed pilgrims
from the Middle East. Pilgrims from the West stayed in a house opposite ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s residence in
Haifa.

DEVELOPMENT UNDER SHOGHI EFFENDI
In 1921, when Shoghi Effendi became Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith according to the provisions of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament , he promptly considered the steps required for the establishment
of the Universal House of Justice, the supreme council of the Bahá’í Administrative Order (See:
Administration, Bahá’í). In 1922 he gathered in Haifa "a group of representative and well-known
Bahá’ís" to discuss establishing the Universal House of Justice.4 However, it became apparent that such
a move would be premature, as it required a firm administrative foundation and a pool of well-informed
Bahá’ís from which to draw both electors and membership—conditions that did not exist in 1922.

Thus Shoghi Effendi "set about trying to establish at least the preliminary forms that might precede its
election." 5 During the early years of his ministry, he began bringing to Haifa Bahá’ís who could form a
secretariat to assist him in his work. His first collaborator, Dr. John E. Esslemont from England, arrived
in Haifa in November 1924 but died suddenly a year later, in November 1925. Others whom Shoghi
Effendi approached were unable for a variety of reasons to come to Haifa or came but soon had to
leave. As a result, Shoghi Effendi gave up for the time being the idea of bringing a number of
competent Bahá’ís to Haifa to form an international Bahá’í secretariat. Instead, he relied on members of
his family to assist him in his work as Guardian. Whenever he was absent from the Holy Land, he left
principal responsibility in the hands of his great-aunt Bahíyyih Khánum, the daughter of Bahá’u’lláh.
Shoghi Effendi’s father, Mírzá Hádí Shírází Afnán, represented him in meetings with officials and assisted
with Persian correspondence. Shoghi Effendi’s cousins Rúhí and Suhayl Afnán and his brother Husayn
Rabbání, all of whom had studied in Beirut, served Shoghi Effendi, among others, in the position of
English secretary. He had Persian secretaries as well: ‘Azízu’lláh Bahádur, Mahmúd Zarqání, and Núri’d-
dín Zayn.

In 1925 Shoghi Effendi invited Effie Baker, the first Australian woman to become a Bahá’í (See: Dunn,
Clara, and Dunn, John Henry Hyde.Arrival in Australia), to remain in Haifa after her pilgrimage. She

served until 1936 as the keeper of the Western Pilgrim House and the custodian of the International
Bahá’í Archives. An accomplished photographer, she took photographs of the Bahá’í World Center, many
of which were published in early volumes of the publication called The Bahá’í World. Between July 1930
and January 1931, at Shoghi Effendi’s request, Baker traveled extensively in Iraq and Iran, creating a
photographic record of sites associated with Bábí and Bahá’í history.

In the summer of 1929, Shoghi Effendi conceived the idea of holding an international conference at
which the formation of National Spiritual Assemblies (See: Administration, Bahá’í.Institutions of Bahá’í
Administration.National Spiritual Assemblies) in the Middle East, as well as the subject of the Bahá’í
administration in general, could be informally discussed. Plans for the conference were in hand when
Shoghi Effendi learned that some of the older believers saw this as an opportunity to elect some form
of interim international body. Shoghi Effendi believed this to be untimely and canceled the conference,
saying it would be "a source of confusion, misunderstanding and even controversy."6 He held in
abeyance for the next twenty years the idea of setting up a precursor to the House of Justice,
concentrating instead on building up the network of Local and National Spiritual Assemblies around the
world as "the bedrock upon the strength of which the Universal House is in future to be firmly
established and raised." 7

From the beginning of his ministry, Shoghi Effendi also devoted great effort to the physical development
of the Bahá’í World Center—safeguarding, extending, and beautifying its properties. Mírzá Muhammad-
‘Alí and his supporters let the Mansion of Bahjí fall into so dilapidated a condition that by November
1927 the roof was in danger of collapsing, causing them to seek assistance from Shoghi Effendi. He was
then able to insist that they evacuate the building before he undertook repairs. They moved out of the
mansion two years later, and Shoghi Effendi immediately set about restoring it. Later he obtained the
approval of the British authorities for it to become a museum, permanently transferred to his control as
Head of the Faith. In 1952 he was able to acquire extensive land around Bahjí for its beautification.
Just before his passing in 1957, Shoghi Effendi succeeded in negotiating the expropriation by the state
of the last of the properties around Bahjí occupied by the remnants of the Covenant-breakers. He also
obtained permission for the Bahá’ís to have access to the room in the Acre citadel that had been
occupied by Bahá’u’lláh, and in 1950 he secured the lease of the property at Mazra‘ih, where Bahá’u’lláh
resided from 1877 to 1879.

In Haifa, Shoghi Effendi improved the facilities for pilgrims by building the Western Pilgrim House,
which had been contemplated by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, on a site across Haparsim Street from the House of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. This project had been initiated through a benefaction by Harry Randall, one of the early
Bahá’ís in the United States, and was completed in 1926 with the assistance of Amelia Collins, another
prominent American Bahá’í. Shoghi Effendi supervised the addition of three rooms to the Shrine of the
Báb, as intended by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, built its superstructure (completed in 1953), and progressively

extended the terrace on which it stands; purchased land for the buildings of the permanent
administrative center, the terraces above and below the Shrine of the Báb, and the site for the future
Bahá’í House of Worship (Mashriqu’l-Adhkár) in Haifa; laid out rudimentary and symbolic terraces below
the Shrine, linking it to the main avenue of the city; erected a befitting memorial over the resting place
of Bahíyyih Khánum and transferred the remains of the brother (See: Mihdí, Mírzá) and the mother of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá to a location near it; and constructed the first of the buildings of the administrative center,
the International Archives Building, which was completed in 1957. Shoghi Effendi frequently referred to
Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet of Carmel , written in 1890 during one of His visits to Mount Carmel, as the
charter for the development of the Bahá’í World Center.

When the Jewish-Arab conflict in the Holy Land
reached a peak in the 1940s, Shoghi Effendi
asked the majority of the Bahá’ís to leave the
country, except for a small number whom he
retained as caretakers of the Bahá’í holy places
and gardens and for other essential services.

Shoghi Effendi maintained cordial contacts with
local and national figures in Mandatory Palestine
and later in the State of Israel, thereby
facilitating the recognition of the Bahá’í World
Center by the authorities and the granting of tax-
exempt status to the Bahá’í holy places,
beginning in 1934 with the properties on Mount       The dome and drum of the Shrine of the Báb take shape over the

Carmel. The recognition thus won from the British International Community. Bahá’í Media Bank
Mandate authorities was continued after 1947 by
the State of Israel. Among the actions taken by Shoghi Effendi to consolidate the position of the Bahá’í
World Center was the establishment of Palestine branches (later, Israel branches) of several National
Spiritual Assemblies. Shoghi Effendi was then able to transfer to these officially incorporated bodies
various Bahá’í properties in the Acre–Haifa area that had previously been held in the names of
individuals.

As the Bahá’í administrative institutions around the world developed, they became the primary focus of
Shoghi Effendi’s extensive correspondence, which comprised approximately thirty-six thousand letters
and messages. He also remained in contact with individual Bahá’ís in every land.

The support and secretarial assistance that Shoghi Effendi’s family gave him gradually diminished during
the 1940s and early 1950s, as one by one the surviving relatives broke the Covenant and were expelled
from the Bahá’í community. Soon only his wife, Rúhíyyih Khánum (See: Hands of the Cause of God),
whom Shoghi Effendi described as "my helpmate, my shield . . . and my tireless collaborator," 8
remained to assist him with his English correspondence. Her father, Canadian architect Sutherland
Maxwell (See: Hands of the Cause of God), designed the superstructure of the Shrine of the Báb and
aided Shoghi Effendi in its construction. In 1947 Rúhíyyih Khánum’s close friend Gladys Anderson was
invited to move from the United States to Haifa, where she took over a wide range of responsibilities.
In early 1948 her fiancé, Ben Weeden, was also invited to serve at the Bahá’í World Center. He
assisted with the building projects, among other assignments. After their marriage, the couple attended
many official functions and played a role in contacting government officials on Shoghi Effendi’s behalf.
Their services in this capacity continued until February 1951, when Ben Weeden had to leave Haifa
because of ill health. Gladys Weeden continued her work in Haifa for nearly a year, leaving to join her
husband in early 1952.

During the months spanning the end of 1950 and the beginning of 1951, Shoghi Effendi took a major

step in the development of the administrative institutions at the Bahá’í World Center. In November
1950 he invited five Bahá’ís to serve in Haifa. They were Lutfu’lláh Hakím, originally from Iran but then
residing in England, who had served at the Bahá’í World Center during the ministry of `Abdu’l-Bahá;
Amelia Collins and Charles Mason Remey, prominent American Bahá’ís since the time of `Abdu’l-Bahá
(both of whom Shoghi Effendi would shortly name among the first contingent of the Hands of the Cause
of God); and Ethel Revell and Jessie Revell, sisters from the United States who had also been Bahá’ís
since the time of `Abdu’l-Bahá. After these five arrived, he informed them, the Weedens, and Rúhíyyih
Khánum of his intention to appoint them as members of an International Bahá’í Council, with Rúhíyyih
Khánum to be the liaison between the Guardian and the Council. In a message dated 9 January 1951,
he proclaimed to the Bahá’í world the "weighty epoch-making decision" to form the "first embryonic
International Institution" of the Bahá’í Faith.9

With the unexpected departure of the Weedens, the Council consisted of six members. In March 1952
Shoghi Effendi announced the enlargement of the Council to include Leroy Ioas from the United States,
as Secretary-General, and Ugo Giachery from Italy, member at large. Like Collins and Remey, both had
recently been named Hands of the Cause. Subsequently, Shoghi Effendi appointed a ninth member,
Sylvia Ioas, who resided in Haifa with her husband, Leroy. Shoghi Effendi gave the members of the
International Bahá’í Council many of the functions of liaison with government authorities.

Media Bank                              When the Universal House of Justice was elected in 1963, its

nine members and their families took up residence in Haifa. The
Western Pilgrim House became the offices of the Universal House of Justice, and a small secretariat was
recruited to serve it. From that time onward, the Bahá’í World Center has continued to grow, and the
number of those working as volunteers has increased, by March 2008 totaling 665 full-time volunteer
workers from seventy-nine countries. A large proportion of the staff consists of youth volunteers
(numbering some 338 between the ages of 18 and 30 in March 2008) who assist with various support
activities.

A measure of the expansion at the Bahá’í World Center is the fact that whole departments are now
responsible for tasks that Shoghi Effendi used to undertake single-handedly. The exact organization of

departments and offices varies from time to time, but they can be grouped into the following
categories:

> Secretariat—concerned with the correspondence of the Universal House of Justice, including the
> filing, indexing, and retrieval of this material, as well as the processing of responses to incoming
> letters.
> Research Department—responsible under the direction of the Universal House of Justice for
> preparing material from the authoritative Bahá’í texts on issues specified by the Universal House
> of Justice, as well as producing compilations of scripture, translating and checking translations,
> and researching questions that come from all parts of the Bahá’í world.
> Department of Library and Archival Services—divided into an Archives Office, responsible for the
> preservation, arrangement, and description of the Bahá’í authoritative texts; a Conservation
> Office, responsible for preserving the Bahá’í sacred writings and relics, as well as other historic
> documents and artifacts; and the Bahá’í World Center Library.
> Offices charged with the responsibility for major construction and renovation projects and for
> the preservation and maintenance of the holy places and other Bahá’í properties at the World
> Center, including acquisition, restoration and construction, cleaning, maintenance, security, and
> gardens development. Important acquisitions include outright ownership of Mazra‘ih (1973), the
> House of ‘Abdu’lláh Páshá (1975), and additional land around Bahjí and Mazra‘ih and on Mount
> Carmel. This group of offices also organizes pilgrimages.
> Offices concerned with all legal issues and relations with government agencies, the media, and
> civil society. On 22 April 1987 an international agreement was signed with the State of Israel,
> carrying forward the recognition that had been obtained by Shoghi Effendi under the British
> Mandate and in the early years of the creation of the State of Israel and defining the
> relationship of the Bahá’í World Center with the state.
> Offices responsible for statistical analysis and for audiovisual resources.
> Offices responsible for worldwide issues related to socioeconomic development and the
> environment.
> Offices concerned with the management of funds, including such functions as handling
> contributions, accounting, purchasing, disbursements, and cost analysis.
> Offices that perform service functions—meeting needs for data processing, personnel,
> accommodation, health, telecommunications, and administrative development.

Certain offices and institutions have functioned as adjuncts and auxiliaries of the Bahá’í World Center
although physically located outside the Acre–Haifa area. The first of these was the International Bahá’í
Bureau, established in 1925 in Geneva. Currently, Bahá’í official contacts with most international
organizations are carried out through the external affairs offices of the Bahá’í International Community
situated in Haifa, New York, Geneva, and elsewhere.

In 1973 the International Teaching Center was established to function as the central institution
coordinating the work of the Continental Boards of Counselors and their Auxiliary Boards around the
world. The members of the International Teaching Center were the Hands of the Cause, throughout
their lifetimes, and Counselors appointed by the Universal House of Justice to serve in that capacity.
The former Western Pilgrim House was the office of the International Teaching Center for many years
until its own building on Mount Carmel was completed in 2000. At present the International Teaching
Center has nine full-time Counselors as members and a growing support staff.

Communications between the Bahá’í World Center and the rest of the Bahá’í world have increasingly
moved from letters and cablegrams to newer electronic forms such as electronic mail, entailing a
corresponding increase in use of electronic data storage and retrieval.

During the last quarter of the twentieth century, the Bahá’í World Center entered a new stage in its
development. Several new buildings were erected. The first was the Seat of the Universal House of
Justice; ground was broken in 1975, and the building was occupied in January 1983. The next major
construction on Mount Carmel occurred in the period 1990–2001, with completion between 1999 and
2001 of the buildings for the International Teaching Center and the Center for the Study of the Texts;
an extension to the International Bahá’í Archives Building; landscaped Terraces of the Shrine of the
Báb, which stretch from the foot of Mount Carmel to its crest; and an Office of Public Information
building, located under Terrace 11, that includes a Visitor Information Center.

Bahá’u’lláh describes the land to which He was banished thus: "This Holy Land hath been mentioned
and extolled in all the sacred Scriptures. In it have appeared the Prophets of God and His chosen Ones.
. . . This is the promised Land in which He Who is the Revelation of God was destined to be made
manifest. . . . the Land of unfading splendor. Whatever hath come to pass in this Day hath been
foretold in the Scriptures of old." 11 Shoghi Effendi describes it as "the Land promised by God to
Abraham, sanctified by the Revelation of Moses, honored by the lives and labors of the Hebrew
patriarchs, judges, kings and prophets, revered as the cradle of Christianity, and as the place where
Zoroaster . . . 'held converse with some of the Prophets of Israel,' and associated by Islám with the
Apostle’s night-journey . . . to the throne of the Almighty." 12

Shoghi Effendi stresses the significance of both the spiritual and administrative world centers of the
Bahá’í Faith having been permanently fixed in the Acre–Haifa area in the Holy Land.The most important

location is the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, the qiblih of the Bahá’í world. Second in spiritual importance is the
Shrine of the Báb, situated on Mount Carmel, the "Mountain of God." Shoghi Effendi describes the
remains of the Báb as being at the center of "nine concentric circles," the outermost of which is the
entire planet, the next being the Holy Land, then Mount Carmel, the Bahá’í properties on Mount
Carmel, the gardens and terraces that enclose the Shrine of the Báb, the superstructure of the Shrine
itself, the original Shrine built by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the vault under the central room of the Shrine, and the
alabaster sarcophagus in which the remains of the Báb lie.13 The presence of the tombs of the sister,
brother, and mother of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the Monument Gardens adjacent to the Shrine of the Báb
"incalculably reinforces the spiritual potencies of that consecrated Spot,"14 which is "designated by
Bahá’u’lláh Himself" as "the seat of God’s throne." 15 The world administrative institutions of the Bahá’í
Faith are, thus, inextricably linked with sites of great spiritual significance.

In May 2001 the Universal House of Justice, addressing the
Bahá’ís gathered in Haifa for the opening of the Terraces of the
Shrine of the Báb, linked the developments on Mount Carmel
with a new stage in the Bahá’í Faith’s and humanity’s evolution:

> The majestic buildings that now stand . . . on the slope
> of the Mountain of God, together with the magnificent
> flight of garden terraces that embrace the Shrine of the
> Báb . . . offer timeless witness to the fact that the
> followers of Bahá’u’lláh have successfully laid the
> foundations of a worldwide community transcending all
> differences that divide the human race, and have
> brought into existence the principal institutions of a
> unique and unassailable Administrative Order that shapes
> this community’s life. In the transformation that has
> taken place on Mount Carmel, the Bahá’í Cause emerges
> as a visible and compelling reality on the global stage,
> as the focal center of forces that will, in God’s good time,
> bring about the reconstruction of society, and as a
mystic source of spiritual renewal for all who turn to it. 16     Approach and entrance to the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh,
