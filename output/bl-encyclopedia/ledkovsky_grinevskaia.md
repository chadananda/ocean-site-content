department of the Gor'kii Institute of World Literature and completed her studies
in 1980. Her first major literary ''success,''The Myth ofSvetlana (Mif o Svetlane,
1984; VAAP, 1988), was produced at the Leningrad Theater for Young Spec­
tators, with music by the songwriter Veronika Dolina. This play about a ''good
daughter,'' whose personal life flounders, was judged too pessimistic for its day
and immediately removed from the repertory, but nonetheless convinced its
author of her calling. During the glasnost' years, Gremina earned critical rec­
ognition for her works, especially Wheel of Fortune (Koleso fortuny, 1989;
Teatr, 1991), a triptych chronicling the fates of a brother and two sistersr-­
sensitive, idealistic, and out-of-place members of the contemporary intelligentsia.
At the First International Festival of Young Dramatists, held in 1990 at Ostrov­
skii's estate, Shchelykovo, Gremina's variations on the theme of Mozart and
Salieri, Etudes for the Left Hand {Etiudy dlia levoi ruki), received first prize,
thus firmly establishing her as one of the leading playwrights of her generation.
Nevertheless, Gremina's intricately crafted lyrical-psychological dramaturgy,
full of literary allusions, has failed to engage the attentions of mainstream the­
aters. The fledgling Moscow Theater ''On Krasnaia Presnia'' has adopted Grem­
ina as "their" dramatist and commissioned several works, including Inquest
through Bystanders (Doznanie cherez okol'nykh lits, 1992), based on Dostoev­
skii's Crime and Punishment. Her whimsical radio plays, A Cup ofTea (Chashka
chaiu), Friend to the lnnguishing (Drug toskuiushchikh), and Morning Coffee
in Bed for Six Persons (Utrennyi kofe v posteli na shest' person), have bee n
broadcast on German radio (Cologne, 1992).
   At the Second International Festival of Young Dramatists in 1992, the dramatist
Mikhail Roshchin hailed Gremina'sThe Cornet 0. Affair (Delo korneta O-va) for
combining "elitist" literary sensibility with the genre of the "boulevard novel"
(echoing Gremina's idol, Dostoevskii) and prophesied success in the commer­
cially oriented post-glasnost' Russian theater. With the dramatist Mariia Arba­
tova, Gremina is cofounder of the moderate M. feminist club "Hannony"
(Gannoniia).

GRINEVSKAIA, Izabella Arluid'evna ('1. Grin'; b. May 3,              1864; Poland; d.
1944). Poet, dramatist, and translator.
  With wit and intelligence Grinevskaia worked in several areas of literature,
though she gained most renown in the Silver Age for her playwriting.
  Grinevskaia was born in Poland. As a child she began writing prose and poetry




                                                                                             f

    in both Russian and Gerntan . Grinevskaia began her literary career by translating
    from German, Polish, Italian, and French and by writing scholarly and critical
    articles. She considered her most important articles to be "On Rhyme"                 (0
•
    rifme), ''On Stage Direction''        (0 remarke), ''Whom Sofia Pavlovna Loves''
    (Kogo liubit Sofia Pavlovna), "Gerhardt Hauptmann and the Motifs of His
    Plays" (Gerkb ardt Gauptman i motivy ego dram), and under              the pseudonym 'I.
I
    Grin,' uA Tourist's Letters about an Exhibition in Stockholm" (Pis'ma turista
•

    o vystavke v Stokgol'me) .
         The most important aspects of Grinevskaia' s work        are   her plays and poetry.
    In   1895 Grinevskaia began her career as a        dramatist with the play ''The First
    Stoun" (Pervaia groza), which was staged at the Aleksandrioskii Theater in
    1896. After that Grinevskaia wrote a series of humorous one-act plays ''Work
    Day"--{Trudovoi den'), "A Dance Lesson" (Urok tantsev), "Play for De­
    parting" (P'esa dlia raz"ezda), "The Letter" (Pis'mo), "They've Agreed"
    (Sgovorilis'), "The Conflagration" (Pozhar), "Bear Hunting" (Okhota na med­
    vedia), and 'Letter from the Village'' (Pis'mo iz derevni)-which ran in theaters
                    t



    both in the capital and in the provinces. These one-act plays belong to the genre
    of the lyrical comedy.
         At the   same   time that she wrote these plays, Grinevskaia began writing stories
    which were published at first in the newspaper NewTimes (NVr) and the journal
    Pictorial Review (ZhivOb). Basically they were sketches of the daily life of the
    intelligentsia., frequently humorous in nature.
         Grinevskaia began writing poetry after the publication of her plays and stories.
    Her first attempts at poetry won the approval of Viktor Burenin. Grinevskaia was
    close to the circle of writers and critics grouped around the newspaper NewTimes.
    Aleksei A. Suvorin was the first to publish her stories, while his father, Aleksei S.
    Suvorin, supported her work in drama. One of Grinevskaia' s first poems was pub­
    lished by Vladimir Solov'ev in the journal Northern Herald (SevY).
         Grinevskaia considered her most significant dramatic work the social drama
    Bab ed-Din (Bah,    1903), which was dedicated to the life of the founder of the
    Persian. religious and philosophical sect of Babists. In 1904 the drama Bab ed­
    Din was put on by the director E. P. Karpov on the stage of the Literary and
    Art Society. Though successful, for political       reasons   the play was taken off the
    stage .. Suppletnenting this play was the tragedy in verse, Bekha-Ulla           (1912),
    about Bab ed-Din's successors.
         In poetry, Grinevskaia continued the traditions of Fet, Polonskii, and Sluch­
    evskii. Grinevskaia's basic lyrical themes        are   love and the contemplation of
    nature. She also translated a great deal. The Aleksandrinskii Theater produced
    her translations, among others, of the play La cittd morta (Mertvyi gorod) by
    D'Annunzio. Grinevskaia's last book was            the collection of poems     Pavlovsk
    (1922) about 1tbe palace complex's architectural monuments.
         In her autobiography, Grinevskaia gave the following evaluation of herself:
    "It'd be fine with me if my biographers would say: 'Izabella Grinevskaia was
    a poet, dramatist, and critic.... She lived, didn't save money, never provided

for the next day; she breathed with the assurance that a future life would be
provided her in which something splendid held sway, probably merciful love,
and with this assurance she died . . . ' " (IRLI, f. 377).

GRUSHKO,        Nataliia VasO'evna (m. Ostrovskaia; b. 1892; d. 19?). Poet,
playwright, and prose writer.
  Grushko wrote and published primarily poetry in the period 1911-1922. She
focused on the subject of women, especially in their relation to various per­
mutations of love.
 Grushko published her first collection of poetry, Poems (Stikhi), in 1912.
Individual poems of hers appeared in several journals and anthologies in the
1910s. She also wrote and published a play, Blind Love (Slepaia liubov', 1915),
and some short prose works. After the revolution, in the early 1920s, Grushko
was associated with the House of Writers (Dom Literatorov), where she had
some success with the public as a poet. When Blok was the chairman of the
Petrograd Union of Poets, Grushko served as a member of the union's presidium.
She published the collection Eve (Eva, 1922) in two editions and was included
in Gusman's 100 Poets (Sto pOOtov, 1923). After that there is no infonnation
about her life or work.
  Her literary debut was a prose parable entitled ''The Magic Umbrella'' (Vol­
shebnyi zontik, 1911). It tells of the protection of an innocent girl from evil,
but also of her desire to know reality. The parable contains certain images that
Grushko was to repeat subsequently in her poetry: a centtal female figure; the
association of the feminine with nature, especially flowers; an Eastern setting.
Grushko' s early poetry featured a sensual natural setting as a backdrop and
analogue for male-female relationships.
