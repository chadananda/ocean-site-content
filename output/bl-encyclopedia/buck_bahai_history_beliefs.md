Baha’i:
History, Beliefs, Practices

CHRISTOPHER BUCK

History

The Baha’i Faith was founded by two men: the Bab (the “Gate,” 1819–1850) and
Baha’u’llah (the “Glory of God,” 1817–1892). Baha’i history begins on May 22, 1844,
when a young merchant, Sayyid ‘Ali-Muhammad Shirazi, proclaimed himself to be a
Messenger of God and Herald of a greater One to follow. The Bab’s religious claims
outraged the clerics of Shi‘a Islam, the predominant religion in Persia, who pronounced
the death sentence on the Bab. He was executed before a firing squad of 750 soldiers in
Tabriz on July 9, 1850.

The Bab’s primary purpose was to prepare the way for the advent of a messianic
figure greater than himself. Baha’is believe that this was none other than Mirza
Husayn-‘Ali Nuri Mazandarani, known by his spiritual title, Baha’u’llah. In 1852,
Baha’u’llah was arrested because he was a Babi leader, and was thrown in jail in the
capital of Persia, Tehran. During four months of imprisonment Baha’u’llah experienced
prophetic visions that bade him arise for the uplift of humanity and the unification of
the world in a federation of nations.

After his release in 1853, Baha’u’llah was exiled, first to Baghdad, then to
Constantinople and later Adrianople in 1863, and finally, in 1868, to a penal colony at
Akka in Palestine (now Israel). After several years, he was released to live in the house
of Udi Khammar, where Baha’u’llah revealed the Kitab-i-Aqdas (“The Most Holy Book”)
as his laws for the new Faith.

Throughout his nearly 40-year prophetic career, Baha’u’llah revealed a prodigious
corpus of writings that comprise the heart of Baha’i scripture—the equivalent of a
hundred books. Baha’u’llah passed away on May 29, 1892.

Baha’i Timeline

> The Bab (d. 1850)               ‘Abdul-Baha (d. 1921)
> Kitab-i-Aqdas revealed (1873)   Shoghi Effendi (d. 1957)
> Baha’u’llah (d. 1892)           Universal House of Justice established in Haifa, Israel (1963)

In his Will and Testament, Baha’u’llah designated his son ‘Abdu’l-Baha—who had
long emerged as the natural and obvious leader—as his successor. ‘Abdu’l-Baha had
traveled throughout North Africa, Europe, the United States and Canada in 1910–1913,
promoting Baha’u’llah’s gospel of social salvation—justice, virtue, and unity.

‘Abdu’l-Baha led the Baha’i world until his passing in 1921. His grandson, Shoghi
Eﬀendi, who was studying at Oxford University at the time of ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s
“ascension” (as Baha’is honorifically refer to his death), assumed the leadership of the
Baha’i community, as explicitly provided for in ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s own Will and Testament.
Shoghi Eﬀendi orchestrated the worldwide development and expansion of the Baha’i
religion through a series of global initiatives, or “Plans,” that proved highly successful in
the systematic growth of the new religious community. As a result, the Baha’i Faith now
comes close to being the most widespread religious community in the world today—
exceeded only by Christianity.

Five years after Shoghi Eﬀendi’s passing in 1957, Baha’i representatives from the
various National Spiritual Assemblies (democratically elected Baha’i councils)
worldwide, met in 1963 in Haifa, Israel, to elect the first Universal House of Justice, a
nine-member international council (elected every five years) that now directs the aﬀairs
of the Baha’i world, with its seat on Mt. Carmel in Haifa, Israel. This is considered a
divine institution, as Baha’u’llah had explicitly ordained the Universal House of Justice

Not all places in the world are open to the Baha’i tradition. Ever since the Islamic
Revolution of 1979, the Islamic Republic of Iran has systematically oppressed the Baha’i
community. Through draconian measures that exclude the Baha’is from the protections
of the Iran’s Constitution, the regime bars Baha’is from the constitutional rights
enjoyed, at least in theory, by other religious minorities.

Beliefs

Baha’i belief acknowledges one true God as an “unknowable Essence,” far beyond
the reach and ken of men. In other words, God may not be comprehended

Baha’i: History, Beliefs, Practices                                                     716

but only apprehended. God is a profound mystery, yet with clues everywhere, pervading
creation. Since God cannot be known by essence, only the nature and will of God can be
appreciated.

“Progressive Revelation” is the Baha’i belief that Messengers of God successively
appear throughout history to establish world religions that renew and amplify spiritual
teachings and declare new social laws suited for that day and age. These Messengers of
God reveal, from age to age, God’s will and purpose. Baha’is consider such religious
figures as Abraham, Moses, Zoroaster, Buddha, Christ and Muhammad to be such
Messengers of God.

Many world religions look forward to a time when the world would be saved by a
world-messiah. Baha’is see these messianic expectations as convergent. In 1863 in
Baghdad, Baha’u’llah proclaimed himself to be the “Promised One” of all religions, and
as the one whom Christ foretold would come in the spirit and power of Christ himself—
not as a reincarnation, nor as the Incarnation, but as the “Manifestation” of God.

Baha’is believe that Baha’u’llah symbolically fulfills many religions prophecies, for
example, Baha’is regard Baha’u’llah as the return of Christ. Baha’is also believe that
Baha’u’llah has come, in fulfillment of Jewish prophecies, as the Lord of Hosts and
“Everlasting Father” (even though these were not traditionally believed to be prophetic
titles). Baha’u’llah, moreover, is seen by Baha’is as the return of Jesus in Sunni Islam; as
the return of Husayn in Shi‘a Islam; as Shah Bahram Varjavand for the Zoroastrians; as
Maitreya, or the Fifth Buddha, in Buddhist millennial belief; as Kalki Viṣṇuyaśas in
Hindu (Vaisnavaite) chiliasm. Many Native American Baha’is also believe in Baha’u’llah
as the return of White Buﬀalo Calf Woman for the Lakota, the return of Deganawida
among the Iroquois, and the return of Viracocha among the Quechua Indians. In a word,
they believe that Baha’u’llah is the world-messiah.

A Baha’i accepts the teachings of Baha’u’llah and the interpretive authority of
‘Abdu’l-Baha and Shoghi Eﬀendi, as well as the ongoing governing authority of the
Universal House of Justice. Baha’is live according to the laws and precepts revealed by
Baha’u’llah in the Most Holy Book, as further elucidated by ‘Abdu’l-Baha and Shoghi
Eﬀendi, and as extended and adapted, by the Universal House of Justice, to new
situations in which Baha’i principles may be wisely applied.

Baha’i Demographics

> Number of Baha’is in the world: 7,447,000.
> Percentage of world population: 0.1 percent.

Countries where Baha’is more than 50 percent: None

Baha’is have promoted their message of unity in more countries than any other smaller religion.

> The Baha’i religious tradition is the only religion to have grown faster in every United Nations region over
> the past 100 years than the population. Hence it is the fastest growing religion over that period. Baha’is
> have viable communities in every country of the world except North Korea and the Vatican.

Baha’is often talk about the “Three Onenesses”: that there is but one, almighty
God; that world religions, in their pure form, impart divine truths; and that humanity—
metaphorically, biologically and spiritually—is “one family.” The purpose of the Baha’i
Faith is to unify the world by establishing a common foundation for harmonious and
prosperous individual and social life. Some of the more prominent Baha’i beliefs include
the equality of men and women, the harmony of science and religion, the need for a
universal language, peace among nations, races and religions, disarmament, world self-
governance through international law, the elimination of prejudices of all kinds, where
the purpose of justice is understood to be precondition for the appearance of true unity
and prosperity.

On each continent, Baha’is have built magnificent temples which are open to
everyone who wishes to experience their architectural beauty and soulful atmosphere.
Perhaps the most celebrated Baha’i house of worship is the Lotus Temple in New Delhi,
India, which attracts more visitors annually than the Taj Mahal. In 2008, UNESCO
designated the Shrine of the Bab (and surrounding Baha’i terraces and gardens at the
Baha’i World Centre on Mount Carmel in Haifa, Israel) and the Shrine of Baha’u’llah in
‘Akka as “World Heritage sites”—the first modern religious edifices to be so designated.

Baha’i Practices

The purpose of life, in the Baha’i view, is to know and worship God, to acquire
virtues, and to carry forward an ever-advancing civilization. Individually, Baha’is pray,
fast, meditate, and work. Baha’u’llah teaches that when done in the spirit of service to
humanity, work is a sacred undertaking and thus is a form of worship. Baha’is promote
unity through non-political means.

Baha’is have a spiritual, solar calendar of nineteen months of nineteen days each,
with four or five intercalary days to round out each solar year. Each day, month, year and
cycle of years is given a name that reflects one of the attributes

Baha’is by World Region

> Asia                3,551,000
> Africa              2,176,000
> Latin America        941,000
> North America        527,000
> Europe               144,000

Oceania              108,000

of God, as manifested in such human perfections as Honor, Justice, Mercy, Generosity,
Grandeur, and the like. By keeping these sterling qualities of character in mind, Baha’is
learn, over time, what it means to be honorable, just, merciful, generous, and noble.

The Baha’i year begins on the first day of Spring (March 21), following a nineteen-
day period of fasting, from sunrise to sunset, lasting from March 2–20. At the beginning
of every Baha’i month, each Baha’i community gathers for a Nineteen-Day Feast,
consisting of spiritual, consultative, and social portions. Baha’is observe nine Holy Days,
on which work is suspended.

Baha’is participate in a series of open “study circles,” a guided group self-study in
a dynamic sequence of brief courses. Each course equips participants with not only
fundamental knowledge about the Baha’i religion, but with basic skills necessary to
eﬀectively teach the Baha’i Faith to others, and to organize children’s classes, lead
activities among junior youth and youth, hold inspirational devotional gatherings open
to all, and facilitate the learning process among believers and those interested in the
Faith.

The world, Baha’is believe, evolves not only physically, but spiritually and socially.

Baha’is understand that, in this day and age, the will of God for humanity is to bring
about global unity through diversity as the next logical stage in the world’s social
evolution. Baha’i principles and social teachings are for the world at large. If carried out
in socially and scientifically enlightened ways, Baha’is believe that these divinely
revealed precepts and practices will have a leavening influence and will eventually
transform the world.

Baha’i:
Theological Exchanges, Current Issues

CHRISTOPHER BUCK

Issues that arise in the course of Baha’i-Christian interfaith encounters, beginning with
issues arising from Baha’i-Christian religious dialogue, may be briefly summarized as
follows.

Individual Salvation and Social Salvation

The Baha’i Faith has a simultaneous emphasis on both personal and social
transformation. Shoghi Eﬀendi, great-grandson of Baha’u’llah and “Guardian” of the
Baha’i Faith from 1921 to 1957, has written that the Baha’i Faith’s mission is “the
salvation, through unification, of the entire planet.” (Eﬀendi 1980, 116.)

Baha’u’llah came for the salvation of entire societies as well as souls. From the
Baha’i perspective, salvation history is a process that has progressively unfolded
throughout the course of prophetic history, and which has reached its most advanced
stage in the advent of Baha’u’llah:

> The declared purpose of history’s series of prophetic revelations, therefore, has been
> not only to guide the individual seeker on the path of personal salvation, but to
> prepare the whole of the human family for the great eschatological Event lying ahead,
> through which the life of the world will itself be entirely transformed. (Baha’i World
> Centre, 2006, 54.)

Typology of Baha’i-Christian Contacts

Witness              Disinterest         Interest

Polemics            Dialogue

The Baha’i statement issued by the Baha’i World Centre, “One Common Faith,”
begins with the observation that, in the early 20th century, the “dominant world faith”
was not Christianity, but “a materialistic interpretation of reality” (ibid., 3). Yet, as the
twentieth century approached its close, “a sudden resurgence of religion as a subject of
consuming global importance” emerged as a worldwide phenomenon (ibid., 5). The
concomitant “search for justice and the promotion of the cause of international peace”
had the eﬀect of “arousing new perceptions of the individual’s role in society” (ibid., 6–
7) insofar as the “rational soul does not merely occupy a private sphere, but is an active
participant in a social order” (ibid., 15).

The Baha’i Faith and Christianity

The most important recent Baha’i outreach to Christian leaders is the letter
addressed “To the World’s Religious Leaders” in April 2002 by the Universal House of
Justice. The nine members of the Universal House of Justice are elected—by plurality
vote, with no nominations or campaigning allowed—by members of Baha’i national
councils (each known as a “National Spiritual Assembly”), who convene once every five
years in Haifa, Israel, site of the Baha’i World Centre. In “To the World’s Religious
Leaders,” interfaith dialogue is highly regarded: “In the context of the transformation
taking place in the human race’s conception of itself, the most promising new religious
development seemed to be the interfaith movement.” In “To The World’s Religious
Leaders,” the Universal House of Justice addresses the primary role of religion,
Christianity included, as follows:

> Religion, as we are all aware, reaches to the roots of motivation. When it has been
> faithful to the spirit and example of the transcendent Figures who gave the world its
> great belief systems, it has awakened in whole populations capacities to love, to
> forgive, to create, to dare greatly, to overcome prejudice, to sacrifice for the common
> good and to discipline the impulses of animal instinct. Unquestionably, the seminal
> force in the civilizing of human nature has been the influence of the succession of
> these Manifestations of the Divine that extends back to the dawn of recorded history.

The Universal House of Justice, “as the governing council of one of the world
religions,” urges religious leaders, in a “spirit of goodwill,” to act concertedly to address
the greatest problems that face the world today: “Vast numbers of people

Baha’i–Christian Theological Exchanges

> Baha’u’llah is successor to Jesus          Reject original sin, the Trinity, Satan

continue to endure the eﬀects of ingrained prejudices of ethnicity, gender, nation, caste
and class.” “Tragically, organized religion,” the Universal House of Justice goes on to say,
“has long lent its credibility to fanaticism.” The problem is that “the greater part of
organized religion stands paralyzed at the threshold of the future, gripped in those very
dogmas and claims of privileged access to truth that have been responsible for creating
some of the most bitter conflicts dividing the earth’s inhabitants.”

Acknowledging that there are “certainly wide diﬀerences among the world’s major
religious traditions with respect to social ordinances and forms of worship,” the
Universal House of Justice maintains that religion, ideally, has “the unique power” to
better the world.

The Universal House of Justice’s letter extends an open invitation to the world’s
religious leaders—leaders of Christianity included—to work collaboratively through
interfaith endeavors: “Inspired by this perspective, the Baha’i community has been a
vigorous promoter of interfaith activities from the time of their inception.”

Current Social Issues of Deep Concern to Baha’is

Before “social justice” served as the secular philosophy of modern democracies in the
twentieth century, the Baha’i Faith had already established ethical principles and social
laws for the ennobling of individuals and the ordering of societies. Social justice can only
be universal if predicated on the unity of the human race. Justice and unity are thus the
hallmarks of Baha’i precept and praxis, as Baha’u’llah declared: “The well-being of
mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly
established” (Baha’u’llah 1978, 167.) As a collective ethical orientation, the Baha’i
concept of social justice is dynamically linked with the principle of unity. “The purpose
of justice,” Baha’u’llah declared, “is the appearance of unity among men.” (ibid., 67.) A
Baha’i theory of social justice can be articulated from the Baha’i sacred writings
themselves, and amplified by policy statements made by the Baha’i International
Community, a religious non-governmental organization (NGO) with consultative status
at the United Nations (UN).

Formed in 1948 as an NGO at the United Nations, the Baha’i International
Community (BIC) represents an association of democratically-elected national and
regional (as in the case of Alaska and Hawaii) Baha’i governing bodies known as
National Spiritual Assemblies. In 1970, the BIC was granted consultative status (now
called “special” consultative status) with the UN Economic and Social

Baha’i: Theological Exchanges, Current Issues                                        723

Council (ECOSOC), followed by consultative status with the United Nations Children’s
Fund (UNICEF) in 1976 and with the UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) in
1989, when working relations with the World Health Organization (WHO) were also
established. In close association with the UN Environment Program (UNEP), the Oﬃce
of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the UN Development Program (UNDP), the BIC
has served as the primary channel for promoting Baha’i universal values for the common
good at the international level. Social issues of deep concern to Baha’is, as represented
by statements of the Baha’i International Community (BIC), include, inter alia, the
following:

> 1.    Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance.
> 2.    Human Rights Reform.
> 3.    Right to Freedom of Religion or Belief.
> 4.    Advancement of Women.
> 5.    Freedom of Conscience.
> 6.    Social Development.
> 7.    Minority Issues.
> 8.    Religious Persecution.
> 9.    Climate Change.
> 10.   Eradication of Violence Against Women and Girls.
> 11.   Eradicating Poverty.
> 12.   Full Employment and Decent Work.
13.   Mobilizing Institutional, Legal and Cultural Resources to Achieve Gender

Equality.

> 14.   Situation of the Baha’is in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
> 15.   Situation of the Baha’is in Egypt.
> 16.   A New Framework for Global Prosperity.
> 17.   Search for Values in an Age of Transition.
> 18.   Sustainable Development.
> 19.   Overcoming Corruption and Safeguarding Integrity in Public Institutions.
> 20.   The Right to Education.
> 21.   Protection of Minorities.

Current Baha’i and Baha’i–Christian Issues

> Persecution in Iran and Egypt            Individual Salvation/Social Salvation
> One common faith                         Baha’i Outreach to Christians
> Christ and Baha’u’llah

Baha’is believe these current issues transcend religious and national boundaries. As
problems without borders, their solutions must likewise cross religious boundaries.

Baha’i Social Action and Public Discourse

Baha’is are currently engaged in “three broad areas of action”: (1) “expansion and
consolidation of the Baha’i community itself ”; (2) participation in “social action” and in
(3) “the discourses of society” on such issues as “governance, the environment, climate
change, the equality of men and women, human rights, to mention a few.” (Universal
House of Justice, letter dated January 4, 2009 to the National Spiritual Assembly of the
Baha’is of Australia.)
