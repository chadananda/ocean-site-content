Ruh al-Quddus

> Ruh al-Quddus (the Holy One) was a Babi disciple and martyr. He was the last of those who joined the ranks of
> the Bab's Letters of the Living, the earliest and highest-ranking group of the Bab's disciples, but the Bab ranked
> him first spiritually. He led the Babis at the Sheikh Tabarsi upheaval in 1848. The Bab, founder of the Babi faith in
> Iran, established a following that eventually developed into the Baha'i faith.

> Mulla Muhammad Ali Barfurushi, later given the name Ruh al-Quddus by the Bab, was born in Barfurush (Babul
> in northern Iran) to a farming family in 1821. During the course of his education in Barfurush and Mashhad, he
> became a sheikh. He set off in about 1837 for Karbala to study under Sayyid Kazim Rashti and returned to
> Barfurush in 1843. He arrived in Shiraz and accepted the Bab in 1844, becoming the last of the Letters of the
> Living. He accompanied the Bab on his pilgrimage to Mecca during 1844–1845. Quddus and two other Babis
> were arrested in Shiraz in 1845 because they had changed the Islamic call to prayer in accordance with the Bab's
> instructions. Their captors burned their beards and pierced their noses and paraded them through the streets.
> After his release, Quddus traveled on to Yazd, Kirman, Isfahan, and Tehran, finally returning to Barfurush. At
> each place he announced the Bab's claims.

> In early 1848, Quddus joined Mulla Husayn Bushrui in Mashhad and the two preached the new religion at that
> shrine city. Later that year, Quddus was one of the main participants at the Conference of Badasht, at which the
> Bab's inauguration of the new religious dispensation was made clear to all. After this conference, Quddus was
> arrested and confined in the house of the senior cleric of Sari but was soon freed. He joined the Babis besieged
> there. Up to this time, Mulla Husayn had been regarded as the foremost disciple of the Bab, but at this time, he
> showed the other Babis that, following the guidance given him by the Bab, they were to regard Quddus as his
> spiritual superior. When Mulla Husayn was killed in fighting, Quddus led the Babi forces alone. Eventually, the
> prince leading the royal army swore on the Koran to allow free passage out of the fort to the Babis. Once they
> emerged, however, he seized and killed all of them. Quddus was handed over to the senior religious leader of
> Barfurush, who, on May 16, 1849, paraded him through the streets, tortured and killed him, and then instigated
> the mob to tear him to pieces. He was 28.

> The few writings of Quddus that remain display a close similarity to that of the Bab in both form and content. It is
> clear that the Bab and Baha'u'llah, the Bab's successor, regarded Quddus as second only to the Bab in
> importance in the Babi religion. The Bab and Baha'u'llah identified him as "The Last," a name of God, and
> Baha'u'llah also referred to him as "The Last Point"—as distinct from the Bab, who was "The First Point."
> Abdul-Baha, Baha'u'llah's son, states that Quddus and the Bab were the two witnesses prophesied in the Book of
> Revelation.
