**ĀYATĪ, ʿABD-**AL**-ḤOSAYN** (b. 1288/1871; d. 1332 Š./1953), son of Mollā Moḥammad-Taqī Āḵūnd Taftī, Bahāʾi missionary, journalist, author, and teacher. After receiving traditional education in Yazd and in Iraq, he became the leader of the Friday prayer (_emām-e Jomʿa_) in Yazd until he converted to Bahaʾism. Then for eighteen years he acted as a missionary (_moballeḡ_) for his new faith in Turkestan, the Caucasus, the Ottoman Empire, and Egypt, during which time he met and associated with ʿAbd-al-Bahāʾ, and also wrote his _al-Kawākeb al-dorrīya fī maʾāṯer al-bahāʾīya_ in two volumes (Cairo, 1914; Arabic tr. by Aḥmad Fāʾeq, Cairo, 1343/1924) on the history of Bahaʾism. This is still one of the major works on the subject. He received the title Raʾīs-al-moballeḡīn (chief of missionaries) but later turned against Bahaʾism, thereby being counted by the Bahaʾis among the _nāqeżīn_ or apostates. (Ṣadr Hāšemī, _Tārīḵ_ IV, pp. 310-11). He returned to Tehran in 1343/1924 and served as a teacher in secondary schools for the rest of his life. During this period he wrote _Kašf al-ḥīal_ in three volumes (Tehran, 1307-10 Š./1928-31 with several reprints) in refutation of Bahaʾism. He also published the periodical _Namakdān_ for six years and was a founding member of the Literary Society (Anjoman-e Adabī) of Yazd.

In his poetry he used the _taḵallo_ṣes Āvāra, Żīāʾī, and Āyatī. In prose he tried to use only purely Persian words. He has seventeen book titles to his credit (see Mošār, _Moʾallefīn_ III, cols. 718-20) of which a useful history of Yazd (_Ātaškada-ye yazdān_, Yazd, 1317 Š./1928) and _Ketāb-e nabīy yā Qorʾān-e fārsī_ (3 vols., Yazd, 1324-26 Š./1945-47) may be noted here.
