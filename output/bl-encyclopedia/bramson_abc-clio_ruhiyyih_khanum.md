Ruhiyyih Khanum

Ruhiyyih Khanum was a Baha'i leader and missionary.

> Ruhiyyih Khanum, or Mary Sutherland Maxwell Rabbani, born in 1910, was the last link to Baha'u'llah's holy
> family. Her full married name, given to her by her husband, Shoghi Effendi, guardian of the Baha'i faith, was
> Amatul-Baha Ruhiyyih Khanum. Her parents held eminent positions within the Baha'i community. Her mother,
> May Bolles Maxwell, played a pivotal role in introducing the Baha'i faith to Europe and Canada. William
> Sutherland Maxwell, her father, was a well-known architect. In 1951, he was appointed a Hand of the Cause of
> God, the highest spiritual station that a Baha'i can attain. Popular Baha'i history recounts that Ruhiyyih Khanum's
> parents were able to conceive her through a miraculous intervention by Abdul-Baha. Amatul-Baha's formal
> schooling was erratic; she was primarily educated by her parents to serve the Baha'i faith. During 1923–1924,
> May Maxwell took her daughter on a year-long trip, making two lengthy pilgrimages to the Baha'i holy shrines in
> Palestine. These were Ruhiyyih Khanum's first meetings with Shoghi Effendi. Two years later, she accompanied
> two of her mother's closest friends on another pilgrimage, again meeting the guardian.

> These trips galvanized her into becoming a dynamic Baha'i youth. She began what became a lifelong effort
> working for peace, and at 15 years old she was elected treasurer of the executive committee of the Fellowship of
> Canadian Youth for Peace. By 1928, she was actively involved in interracial activities. This developed into a
> lifelong passion; Ruhiyyih Khanum was a tireless champion of the rights of indigenous peoples. By the time she
> was 19, she was an experienced public speaker. She continued to speak to audiences on the Baha'i faith
> throughout her life, becoming one of the religion's most prominent spokespersons.

> From her adolescence, Ruhiyyih Khanum was trained by her mother to travel with the goal of disseminating the
> Baha'i faith. In 1935, she began her first major trip to propagate the faith, traveling to Germany with cousins for
> two years. Eventually, she traveled around the world to teach the Baha'i faith. Her father also had an important
> impact on her education, especially because she accompanied him when he attended official functions.
> Eventually, she became the Baha'i faith's premier official representative and met with royalty and rulers around
> the world. Ruhiyyih Khanum also fulfilled her lifelong dream of becoming an author and wrote poetry and other
> works. In 1937, she and her mother were invited by Shoghi Effendi for another pilgrimage. It was during this visit
> that her marriage to Shoghi Effendi was arranged. Ruhiyyih Khanum quickly became the guardian's main support
> and assistant. In 1952, he appointed her a Hand of the Cause of God and began to send her around the world as
> his personal representative.

> In 1957, when Shoghi Effendi and Ruhiyyih Khanum were in London, the guardian died with no successor and no
> will and testament. Ruhiyyih Khanum played a crucial role in maintaining the unity of the Baha'i faith during the
> years that followed. In 1963, when the Universal House of Justice was elected, she felt free to begin traveling
> around the world to again propagate the Baha'i faith and consolidate Baha'i communities. She traveled to more
> than 180 countries. Three of her most memorable trips were those to India in 1964, to Africa from 1969 to 1973,
> and to the Amazon Basin and the Andes in 1975. She died in 2000.
