CHAPTER 2

Discovering

Why the Qur>ān?

The Qurān, the holy book of Islam, may well be the most powerful book in human
history, with the arguable exception of the Bible. Both in world history and contempo-
rary affairs, it is doubtful that any other book now commands, or has in the past
exerted, so profound an inﬂuence. Objectively, one of every ﬁve people on earth today
is Muslim, each of whom subjectively believes that the Qurān actually supersedes the
Bible, and that it is the Qurān – not the Bible – that is unsurpassed. Since Muslims see
Islam as the last of the world’s religions, they view the Qurān as the latest and great-
est book. Even if one does not share this view, the sheer magnitude of its inﬂuence com-
mands respect, and one cannot be cross-culturally and globally literate without some
understanding of this monumental text. The purpose of this chapter is to inspire and
assist readers in discovering the Qurān for themselves, with the helpful synergy of
insider and outsider – religious and secular – perspectives.

Academic Study of the Qur>ān

The study of the Qurān in an academic setting has raised a number of legal and ped-
agogical issues in recent decades, some of which have thrust the scripture into the
public eye in a way that has not been previously experienced. Of course, religion in
general is a controversial topic within education, and demands inevitably arise to know
why the Qurān should (or even can) be taught in a publicly funded university. The sit-
uation in the United States, for example, is one that has provoked legal discussions and
challenges. Doesn’t the study of the Qurān in the university violate the Establishment
Clause of the First Amendment? What about the separation of church and state?

These very concerns were recently raised in US federal courts. A national academic
and legal controversy erupted in summer 2002 when the University of North Carolina

DISCOVERING        19

(UNC) at Chapel Hill required incoming freshmen, as part of its Summer Reading
Program, to read and discuss Michael Sells’ Approaching the Qurān: The Early Revelation
(Sells 1999). This text – a fresh translation and elucidation of the early Meccan sūras
of the Qurān – was recommended by UNC Islamicist Carl Ernst in order to promote an
understanding of Islam, especially in light of the events surrounding the September
11, 2001 terrorist attacks (Burdei 2002).

Alleging that UNC violated the Establishment Clause and abridged students’ rights
to religious free exercise by forcing incoming freshmen and transfer students to study
Islam against their will, a conservative-Christian activist group, the Family Policy
Network (FPN) ﬁled suit in US District Court, Middle District of North Carolina (MDNC),
on July 22, seeking a preliminary injunction to keep UNC from conducting its summer
program. The case was captioned (named) Yacovelli v. Moeser (after James Yacovelli, an
FPN spokesman, and James Moeser, UNC Chancellor). When the FPN lost, it immedi-
ately appealed to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, but lost again. This case was widely
reported (see Euben 2002), both nationally and internationally, but was not judicially
“reported” (that is, the district and appellate decisions were not published).

A later challenge was ﬁled in 2004 but was lost on appeal. Without going into the
technicalities of the Lemon test, which the Court applied along with the endorsement
and coercion tests, the challenge failed. In his decision, Chief Judge N. Carlton Tilley,
Jr. ruled:

> Approaching the Qurān simply cannot be compared to religious practices which have been
> deemed violative of the Establishment Clause, such as posting the Ten Commandments,
> reading the Lord’s Prayer or reciting prayers in school. The book does include Suras, which
> are similar to Christian Psalms. However, by his own words, the author endeavors only to
> explain Islam and not to endorse it. Furthermore, listening to Islamic prayers in an effort
> to understand the artistic nature of the readings and its connection to a historical reli-
> gious text does not have the primary effect of advancing religion. (Yacovelli v. Moeser, 2004
> US Dist. LEXIS 9152 [MDNC May 20, 2004], aff ’d Yacovelli v. Moeser [University of North
> Carolina, Chapel Hill], 324 F.Supp.2d 760 [2004].)

This ruling is consistent with the US Supreme Court’s endorsement of the academic
study of religion in public schools and universities, when Justice Tom C. Clark in 1963
declared that “one’s education is not complete without a study of comparative religion
or the history of religion and its relationship to the advancement of civilization”
(Abington v. Schempp, 374 US 203, 224, n. 9 [1963]). It is the secular approach that
makes the academic study of religion constitutionally permissible: “Nothing we have
said here indicates that such study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objec-
tively as part of a secular program of education, may not be effected consistently with
the First Amendment” (Abington v. Schempp, 374 US 203, 224, n. 9 [1963]). As Justice
Powell has said more recently: “Courses in comparative religion of course are custom-
ary and constitutionally appropriate” (Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 US 578, 607 1987]
[Powell and O’Connor, JJ., concurring]). Based on Justice Clark’s statement as it applies
to the Qurān speciﬁcally, university ofﬁcials now argue that – in addition to being
constitutionally permissible – one’s education is not complete without a study of the

20    CHRISTOPHER BUCK

Qurān (as well as the history of Islam) and its relationship to the advancement of
civilization.

How to Read the Qur>ān?

A nineteenth-century mystic once said that the Qurān eclipses all of the miracles of
all of the previous prophets, for the miracle of the Qurān, alone, remains (Shirazi
1950; Lawson 1988). That is to say, the staff of Moses may have turned into a serpent
and swallowed up the magicians’ snakes in Pharaoh’s court, but that prophetic scepter
has vanished. Moses may well have parted the Red Sea, as Muslims themselves believe,
but that prodigy is long gone. No empirical evidence of either miracle remains today.
What alone abides is the “miracle” of the Qurān – its prodigious ability to transform
the lives of those who believe and accept the Qurān as the best guide for their lives.
This transformation is spiritual alchemy, taking the base appetites that most of us are
born with and transmuting these into the pure gold of a reﬁned moral and spiritual
character. The Qurān can transform a pair of horns into a set of wings, changing the
pious believer from a devil into an angel. Such is the nature of Muslim belief about
the Qurān.

The Qurān can and should be taught in the university – not to convert students into
pious Muslims, but to convert pious Muslim beliefs into something students can under-
stand, so that they can appreciate the power of the book to inﬂuence those who believe
in it. However, beyond the question of why the Qurān should be taught, there is the
problem of how it should be taught. In whatever course and context it may be taught,
the challenge is to engage readers in the study of this text, to assist them in discover-
ing the Qurān for themselves.

Reading the Qurān is far easier said than done. The Qurān is a challenging text. To
the uninitiated, the book is both simplistic and enigmatic. To the untrained eye, the
Qurān, on ﬁrst impression, may strike one as arcane, ﬂorid, repetitive, or otherwise
impenetrable to Westerners wholly unprepared to study the text dispassionately.
However, there is a deeper hermeneutical issue involved, one of attitude and assump-
tions as to the authority and nature of the text.

The Qurān makes its own particular truth-claims, which are quite audacious. It tells
the reader that its source is an archetypal “mother of the book” (umm al-kitāb) in
heaven. The Qurān is therefore of divine origin. It is not only authorized, it is actually
authored by God Himself. This is an extraordinary claim, indeed. As such, from a
Muslim perspective the element of divine revelation is of paramount importance. God
wrote the Qurān, Muslims believe, and thus the book commands their respect. But
should it command the respect of those who have not been raised in its culture, who
might consider it in the university? Absolutely. So where does one begin? There are
methodological considerations that must ﬁrst be addressed. The Qurān may be a difﬁ-
cult text for non-Muslims, but it is not unfathomable.

The still-predominantly Christian West may have serious misgivings as to the truth
of such claims. Isn’t the Qurān an ersatz version of the Bible – a derivative imitation?

Sometimes offensive                                                Sometimes defensive

This very assumption largely biased the Western reception of the Qurān from the very
start, and affected (infected) its study until now. As a result, polarities in the study of
the Qurān have emerged, although these are beginning to disappear. The great divide
in Qurānic studies has historically been the tension between traditional Muslim
approaches and Western academic approaches. Although problematic for gaining a
coherent understanding and appreciation of the Qurān, these two competing para-
digms are somewhat synergistic. If you combine the two, you get what Wilfred Cantwell
Smith (Smith 1959: 53; but cf. McCutcheon 1999) regarded as the insider–outsider
dynamic. In principle, he suggested that the best approach to the study of the Qurān
and Islam is to be able to enter into a believer’s (emic) perspective while maintaining
some degree of relative objectivity (etic perspective). Indeed, Smith’s canon of believer
intelligibility requires that “no statement about a religion is valid unless it can be
acknowledged by that religion’s believers.” This “creative principle” offers the best of
both worlds, for it “provides experimental control that can lead” scholars “dynamically
towards the truth.” However, unless one adheres to Smith’s principle, polarities will
inevitably arise. Table 2.1 highlights the nature of these polarities.

The table shows a complement of productive and reductive approaches. The method
of reading largely determines what is read and how it is understood. The Muslim
approaches the Qurān reverentially and with full faith in the truth it enshrines. The
Western secular approach can be just the opposite: it is skeptical and analytic. But it
does not have to be. Where there are apparent difﬁculties and even apparent contra-
dictions in the text, the Muslim will try to resolve those anomalies by harmonizing them
on a higher plane of understanding, while a person approaching the text from a secular
perspective (the Westerner) may be dismissive of the Qurān as simply a human enter-
prise where inconsistencies and errors are to be expected. Such a conclusion is not only
misguided according to any knowledgeable Muslim, it is also an attack upon the
integrity of a sacred text that is divinely revealed.

This concept of the Qurān as a revealed scripture is basic to an appreciation as to
why Muslims both revere the Qurān and orient their entire lives according to its dic-
tates, for the Qurān and the h.adı̄¯th (oral traditions that report the sayings and actions
of the Muh.ammad) are the two principal sources of authority for Muslim doctrine and
praxis. So, to the questions of where to begin in discovering the Qurān, it only makes
sense to start with the concept of revelation.

Revelation and the Abrahamic Faiths

Scholars have long recognized that claims of revelation are central to the three
Abrahamic faiths of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. What these faiths have in common
is that each is monotheistic. That is, they each preach a belief in a supreme Being, a one-
and-only, all-powerful God. Historically, monotheism is a conscious revolution against
the archaic, pre-monotheistic mind-set. This revolution was not prevalently theoretic
but dynamic. It effected a radical shift in the concentration of what some scholars
call the numinosum, or the locus of the supernatural. Archaic (“primitive” or “primal”)
culture is founded on the idea of an anthropocentric correspondence of microcosm and
macrocosm, of part-to-whole, as in astrology. In the archaic worldview, the numinosum
is situated in and around nature, whereas in a monotheistic framework, the numino-
sum is a supreme being, located outside nature. Monotheism disenchants the universe
by exorcizing the very existence of gods, demons, and sprites. The nature spirits dis-
appear, ghosts vanish, and the astrological basis of fate and predestination collapses.
Experimental science of a pre-modern type could not have been born without the
demythologization of nature that monotheism put into motion. By moving God outside
of nature, monotheism contributes to the revaluation of the ideas of inﬁnity and
the void.

This revolution in worldview – disenchanting nature and seeing divinity as its prime
mover – gave rise to two major deﬁning features of Western civilization: historicism and
technique. The ﬁrst affects the human sciences; the other impacts the physical sciences.
The argument that Islam is one of the unacknowledged roots of Western civilization
ﬂows from this historical perspective: Islamic philosophy and science impacted the high
medieval and renaissance cultures to produce Western civilization, especially after the
Enlightenment.

Within the monotheist worldview that is central to Islam, the Qurān is the literary
amber of revelation – the primary mode of disclosure of God’s will for humanity. The
Qurān speaks of itself as a revealed text. Phenomenologists of religion have identiﬁed
ﬁve characteristics or phenomena typically associated with revelation (Dininger 1987:
356). There are two prime characteristics. (1) Origin or source: All revelation has a
source – God, or something supernatural or numinous communicates some kind of
message to human beings. Wah.y is the technical term for revelation in the Qurān. The
fundamental sense of wah.y seems to be what those steeped in the European romantic
ethos would call a “ﬂash of inspiration,” in the sense that it is sudden and unpremed-
itated; (2) Instrument or means: Revelation is communicated supernaturally, through
the agency of dreams, visions, ecstasies, words, or sacred books. Nuzūl is a synonym for
revelation, but with the explicit notion that the Qurān was “sent down” from its arche-
typal original in the spiritual realm known as the heavens.

Other key phenomena of revelation, all of which the Qurān exempliﬁes, are: (3)
Content or object: Revelation is the communication of the didactic, helping, or punish-
ing presence, will, being, activity, or commission of the divinity. In this case, the Qurān
is a revelation from God, pure and simple, communicated through a series of revela-
tions imparted to Muh.ammad over the course of twenty-three lunar years. Thus, it
would be error and sacrilege to speak of Muh.ammad as the “author” of the Qurān.

DISCOVERING   23

(4) Recipients or addressees: The Qurān itself is a revelation of the universal type. It is a
message from God to the world; (5) Effect and consequence for the recipient: Revelation
transforms its recipient. As the agent of revelation, Muh.ammad was commissioned
with a divine mission to present the Qurān as the voice of God, calling the entire world
to righteousness and justice, to morality and decency, and to a life of prayer and fasting,
and surrender to the will of God. The fact that Muh.ammad was commissioned with a
divine mission does not make Muh.ammad himself divine, as the Qurān itself states:
“He would never order you to take the angels and the prophets as Lords” (Q 3:74).
This idea may be seen in an early Christian text: “Neither is there salvation in believ-
ing in teachers and calling them lords” (Homilies 8:5 in Roberts and Donaldson
1989–90).

How the Qur>ān Was Revealed

With an understanding of revelation generally, the speciﬁcs of the revelation of the
Qurān may now be addressed. Such considerations focus on the person identiﬁed as
the prophet of Islam, Muh.ammad.

It was Muh.ammad’s practice to meditate prayerfully in a cave on Mt. H.irā. He was
practicing tah.annuth, some sort of pious exercise, when he ﬁrst encountered the
archangel Gabriel, who revealed the Qurān to him over the next twenty-three lunar
years. Tradition is unanimous that Gabriel was the agent of revelation, even though he
is mentioned only twice in the Qurān. The Qurān itself explains how God reveals: “It
belongs not to any mortal that God should speak to him, except by revelation, or from
behind a veil, or that He should send a messenger and he reveal whatsoever He will, by
His leave; surely He is All-high, All-wise” (Q 42:50). In other words, while the prophet
revealed the Qurān, it was God who authored it, according to Muslim belief.

The Qurān is modeled on an archetypal al-lawh. al-mah.fūz., the “preserved tablet”
(Q 85:22), having been sent down to the nearest heaven on the “night of power”
(Q 97) in the holy month of Ramad.ān, in order for Gabriel to transmit it to Muh.ammad.
The text of Qurān is from God, Muslims believe, while the recording and editing of
Qurān is by men. It is important to understand the implications of the Qurān being
originally revealed over a period of time, and thereafter collected and edited. Just as the
Qurān cannot be read from cover to cover in quite the same way that one reads a novel
or treatise, the Qurān was not written from cover to cover as well. Just as writers have
ﬂashes of inspiration, Muh.ammad experienced ﬂashes of revelation. These cumula-
tively became the Qurān.

The h.adı̄th literature provides many anecdotes as to how revelations would come
upon Muh.ammad. The descriptions vary. The agent of revelation Gabriel taught
Muh.ammad to recite the ﬁrst passages of the Qurān. Most frequently the accounts
speak of revelations “descending” upon Muh.ammad such that he would hear the
sound of buzzing, or of bells, or would feel a great weight come upon him, or would
enter a trance, after which the words of the Qurān would become indelibly inscribed
in his heart, and subsequently dictated to scribes. The revelations of the Qurān were
ﬁrst recorded by scribes who wrote down the verses on whatever writing materials
were available: leaves and branches of palm trees, white stones, leather, shoulder blades

24    CHRISTOPHER BUCK

of sheep, ribs. One early account states that a revelation was actually eaten by a domes-
tic animal, because it had been recorded on something organic and edible.

After Muh.ammad’s death in 11/632, there was no authoritative record of the rev-
elations. They had to be collected. The process of assembling, collating, and codifying
the Qurān was not informed by a great deal of available information as to dating and
other historical information on which to base the traditional form that the Qurān even-
tually took. According to tradition, the decision to preserve the Qurān was taken after
hundreds of reciters were killed in the Battle of Yamāma (12/633). Umar (who was to
become the second Caliph) suggested to Abū Bakr that the Qurān be collected and
written down. Finally, the text was ﬁxed under Uthmān, in the dialect of the Quraysh
tribe (that of Muh.ammad), said to be the clearest of dialects, according to tradition.
Where difﬁculties in establishing the text arose, the dialect of the Quraysh, the tribe to
which the prophet belonged, was given preference. Written texts required attestation
from reciters, who had heard and memorized the Qurān by heart. Thus, the canon
of the Qurān was ﬁxed as well as the order of the sūras and the integrity of the
consonantal text.

The urgency with which the text became ﬁxed under the decree of the caliph
Uthmān afforded precious little opportunity for a systematic, much less scientiﬁc order-
ing of the text. Its preservation was more important than its sequencing, and it was left
to later Muslims scholars to provide a critical apparatus for more fully appreciating the
pieces that made up the larger whole. How much editing and how intrusive or inter-
pretive such editing may have been is largely a modern question that has occupied
much of Western scholarship on the Qurān.

Soon after the Qurān was revealed, it spread like wildﬁre, racing with the Arab con-
querors during the ﬁrst two centuries of Arab expansion. The rapidity and breadth of
that expansion was dramatic. At this stage, the Qurān had not yet achieved its status
as a world text, for the simple reason that it was considered an “Arab” book (or, rather,
“the” Arab book, since the Qurān is the ﬁrst book in Arabic). Non-Arab converts were
at ﬁrst obliged to attach themselves to various Arab tribes, in a kind of process of spir-
itual and social adoption. It did not take long before non-Arabs, especially the Persians,
took umbrage with this. How could a scripture with a universal message, they argued,
be restricted to just a single ethnicity? And, if not, on what grounds were Arabs justi-
ﬁed in relegating to non-Arabs a secondary status, when the category of “Muslims”
constitutes a spiritual and social “nation” that embraces all races and nations, yet tran-
scends them? Was not the prophet Abraham a Muslim (“one who surrenders” to the
will of God)? And is not anyone who professes belief in the oneness of God and in
the authenticity of the prophet Muh.ammad to be accounted as a believer, on equal
footing with every other? And so it came to be: the appeal to the Qurān’s universalisms,
expressive of its egalitarian ethic, prevailed. Thus Islam, although based on a message
revealed in Arabic, was transposed to other cultures and climes, although it took
centuries before the Qurān itself was actually translated into other languages. This
singular revelation became a universal scripture.

In its ﬁnal form, the Qurān’s 114 sūras are arbitrarily arranged by the longest sūra
ﬁrst (except for the short “opening” chapter). The traditional dating of these sūras has
the “early Meccan sūras” spanning the ﬁrst thirteen lunar years (with early, middle, and

DISCOVERING        25

ﬁnal periods), shifting to the period of “Medinan sūras” in 1/622, coinciding with the
ﬁrst year of the hijra or migration of the early Muslim community from Mecca to
Medina, followed by the “later Meccan sūras” on the prophet’s triumphal return to his
oasis-city of Mecca shortly before the end of his life in 11/632.

Taking what has become a classic, two-part division of Muh.ammad’s life (Watt
1953, 1956), the early Meccan sūras exemplify Muh.ammad’s role as “prophet” while
the Medinan and later Meccan sūras present Muh.ammad’s vocation as “statesman.”
Thus the earlier revelations are intended to kindle hope and to strike the fear of God
into the heart of the hearer by the promise of heaven and the threat of hell. Accord-
ingly, the prophet’s role is that of a “warner” who has come to make people alive to
the threat of impending doom and death unless they repent and surrender to the
will of God.

First warned, later governed – this is basically the purpose of the revelations and the
logic of their sequence. The later Qurānic revelations enshrine laws and principles for
Muslims to follow. Once a Muslim community had formed (the migration of Muslims
to Mecca in 1/622 effectively created the ﬁrst Muslim state), laws were needed. Accord-
ingly, Muh.ammad became a statesman in addition to his role as prophet, and began
revealing the laws and ethical principles that later became the foundation for the four
Sunnı̄ schools of law and a distinctive way of life.

Sources of Revelation?

Whether the Qurān is informed by previous sources is a vexed question. To suggest that
the Qurān somehow derives from predominantly Jewish or Christian sources is tanta-
mount to discrediting the Qurān as a document of revelation. For Muslims, the ques-
tion should be the other way around. The Qurān is the gold standard of divine truth.
Since it is pure and unadulterated, it is previous scriptures that should be measured
against the Qurān, not the other way around. Indeed, the Qurān comprehends all pre-
vious scriptures:

> Within itself, the Qurān provides Muslims with a view of the Bible. Mention is made of
> the “scrolls” of Abraham and Moses, the Tawrā t (Torah) of Moses, the Zabūr (usually
> understood as the Psalms) of David and the Injı̄l (Gospel) of Jesus, all conceived as direct
> revelation from God to the prophet concerned: “Surely we sent down the Torah wherein is
> guidance and light” (Qurān 5.48); “And we sent, following in their footsteps, Jesus son of
> Mary, conﬁrming the Torah before him; and we gave to him the Gospel, wherein is guid-
> ance and light” (Qurān 5.50). In this way, all previous scriptures are pictured within the
> revelatory and compositional image of the Qurān itself. (Rippin 1993: 250)

To say that Muh.ammad was “inﬂuenced” by his religious world and that the Qurān
is a hodge-podge of intermixed inﬂuences is not only highly reductionist, but suggests
that the prophet was himself the author of the Qurān and not God. Surely God had
no need to borrow from previous scripture or religious lore, from the Muslim perspec-
tive. So the tension between traditional Muslim and Western academic approaches is
perhaps nowhere more intense than in discussing this question.

26     CHRISTOPHER BUCK

One approach that is both methodologically sound as well as religiously acceptable
is to look at the foreign vocabulary of the Qurān and also the religious technical terms
and concepts that the Qurān mentions. This area of study has proven fruitful for elu-
cidating the text. But then, again, what exactly is being proved? If used as evidence that
the Qurān is derivative, then this crosses over from a purely descriptive phenomenol-
ogy into an explanatory phenomenology that is inherently reductive. This latter
approach tries to “explain away” the Qurān, presenting it as the product of past inﬂu-
ences rather than as an original work that absorbs and reconﬁgures its cultural content
to produce an Islamic civilization of world-historical proportions.

For Muslims, the only pre-Islamic source for the Qurān is the archetypal “mother
of the book” of which the earthly Qurān is a faithful copy. But Muslim scholars will
readily admit that the Qurān speaks to its historical-contemporary world, which
includes the immediate past. Thus we ﬁnd speciﬁc references to practices from the pre-
Islamic period that the Qurān explicitly forbids. This is “inﬂuence” in the other direc-
tion. For instance, the pre-Islamic practice of female infanticide was quite common,
where parents would bury their infant daughter in the hot, desert sand, if they thought
it too much of a ﬁnancial burden to raise a girl. So, in this respect, Islam functioned as
a women’s protectionist movement. Sufﬁce it to say that knowledge of pre-Islamic
Arabia is the natural starting place for developing a fuller understanding and appreci-
ation for how the Qurān represents a signiﬁcant moral and social advancement after
the pre-Islamic “age of ignorance.”

Major Themes of Revelation

Knowing something of the history of the revelation of the Qurān and its codiﬁcation
provides a necessary orientation. But the real heart of the Qurān is its message. One
useful way of approaching the Qurān is to see it as the vehicle for expressing profound
truths regarding God and the universe, and humankind and its civilizations. God is the
creator, and humankind the creative. The themes of the Qurān, therefore, are
the organizing principles of Islamic religion and civilization. What follow are several
of the major themes of the Qurān. Most of the Qurān’s religious principles are
common to the Abrahamic faiths, and many of its morals may be appreciated as uni-
versal ethical truths.

Exaltation

One feels the presence of God in the Qurān, which makes it such a powerful text. Since
Muh.ammad is the revealer, not author, the pious read the text as the voice of God
Himself. This is not a mere poetic device, as the voice of God in the Puritan poet Michael
Wigglesworth’s “God’s Controversy with New England” (1662). The Qurān is the real
thing, like a whole book of the Ten Commandments and more. This direct communi-
cation of God to man is charged with a power and authority that Muslims feel makes
the Qurān inimitable, and without peer. No other text can compare with it, except

previous scriptures. And rarely are they so direct and compelling. The Qurān is a
conduit to the presence of God, and to follow the Qurān’s dictates is to manifest the
will of God.

Creation

The Qurān accounts for the creation of the world – not as a scientiﬁc treatise, but
rather as a prophetic narrative. Scholars call this cosmogony. The important thing to
remember is that cosmogony often functions as “sociogony” – the genesis of society.
Just as God is the creator of the physical universe, the Qurān is the great moral and
social civilizer of human (Muslim) society, when ideally applied.

Revelation

We have stated earlier that the Qurān is a revelation (actually a series of revelations)
direct from God. In practice that means that everything the Qurān says is taken as
truth. This fact is clearly of profound importance in appreciating the status and author-
ity of the Qurān. While all of the Qurān is God’s revealed truth, the Qurān does not
contain all of God’s revelations. The Qurān “conﬁrms” the truth of previous revela-
tions, as embodied in the Jewish and Christian scriptures. Much of the Qurān, in fact,
is retrospective. It harks back to the days of previous prophets and relates what became
of them and tells of the fate of peoples who rejected and persecuted the warners and
messengers that God sent to them. These historical narratives have a didactic (edifying)
function. They are homilies on religious history, and thus serve a religious purpose.

With its dire warnings of the day of judgment, the Qurān is prospective as well as
retrospective. It endows history with teleology – a purpose and a ﬁnal result. While this
teleology is predestined, the individual can largely choose the outcome for his or her
salvation. Here, salvation is not absolution from sin, but a resolution to abide by the
will of God. This is true for entire societies as well, since they are aggregates of indi-
viduals and families. That is to say, an entire social order can be transformed by fol-
lowing the way of life illuminated by the Qurān. Thus, revelation contains within it
the seeds of a higher civilization.

And so it happened: Islam reigned as the world’s “superpower” during the so-called
dark ages of Europe, when great Muslim civilizations exerted a moralizing, philosoph-
ical and scientiﬁc inﬂuence on the West. Historically, Islam is one of the catalysts that
sparked the Renaissance. Ideally, revelation is the genesis of ideal civilization.

Consummation

The Qurān is not just one of a series of progressive revelations sent by God to help steer
the course of civilization. The Qurān literally is the latest and greatest revelation to
date. We know this because we are told that Muh.ammad is the “seal of the prophets”

– that is, the ﬁnal messenger. He has, in a real sense, completed the series of revela-
tions. The Qurān is therefore the capstone of God’s messages to the world.

Muh.ammad’s station as the “seal of the prophets” is of fundamental importance in
Islam. This appellation comes from the famous “seal verse” (Q 33:40). Although inter-
pretations of this key verse did vary in early Islam (Friedmann 1986), there is now a
consensus among Muslims that the term “seal” means “last,” in the sense of both
“latest” and “ﬁnal.” While Muh.ammad is considered fully human and not divine (Islam
rejects the doctrine of incarnation), this truth-claim easily rivals – in both its audacity
and centrality of dogma – that of Jesus being the son of God. Rather than a person
being the “word” of God, for Muslims the Qurān is the word of God literally. However,
that Muh.ammad is the seal of the prophets is a major truth-claim and is effectively non-
negotiable. It has achieved the status of a dogma, and one learns not to debate this point
with Muslims if friendship is a priority. Accepting Muh.ammad as the seal of the
prophets is absolutely fundamental to Muslims everywhere. And this belief is ﬁrmly
anchored in the Qurān itself.

Salvation

For Muslims, salvation consists in much more than simply being forgiven for one’s past
sins and transgressions. The act of repentance itself effects much of this. Indeed, the
true test of one’s sincerity is a matter of public record, purely in terms of one’s actions.
This record is not simply what gets recorded in the proverbial “Book of Deeds,” to be
read back to each individual on the day of judgment. Rather, pious deeds both mani-
fest and further nurture purity of heart and soul. Here, salvation is active, not passive.
One’s salvation is a matter of degree, not of status. But Islam sees a spiritual life beyond
forgiveness. Salvation is not a change of status that magically and suddenly averts
God’s wrath. Salvation is a process, a reﬁnement of one’s character over time.

A deeper walk with God on the “straight path” of Islam can come about through
spiritual growth and transformation. But how does one do this? What can serve as an
infallible spiritual guide? For Muslims, the way to bring one’s life into greater confor-
mity with God’s will is through following the laws of the Qurān and the example of
Muh.ammad. The truest sign of one’s transformative faith is conformity and dedication
to the principles and teachings of Islam which are preserved, ﬁrst and foremost, in the
Qurān itself. The single most important act of piety is to surrender one’s own will to
that of the will of God. The word “Muslim” means “one who has submitted” or sur-
rendered to the will of God. “Surrender” is not the best translation, because following
God’s will is an act of free will, a vigilant choice, a matter of strength through com-
mitment and practice.

Then what is the will of God? There is a Zoroastrian scripture that states: “The
will of the Lord is the law of holiness” (the Ahunwar, the most sacred formula in
Zoroastrianism, a common refrain found throughout the Zend Avesta – see Vendidad,
Fargard 19, and passim). This means that, rather than trying to divine what the will of
God is in terms of making important life-decisions, the will of God is not so much what

one believes, or what one is, but what one does. What a Muslim believes and what a
Muslim does combine to produce what a Muslim is.

Surrendering to the will of God begins with professing one’s self to be Muslim, by
proclaiming that “There is no god but God” and that “Muh.ammad is the messenger of
God.” As a general rule, Muslims pray more frequently than in any other religion. They
also fast longer, for thirty days during the holy month of Ramad.ān (the dates of which
annually vary because Islam is based on a lunar calendar). Once one is properly ori-
ented towards God, and is conscious of God throughout the day, it becomes much easier
to fulﬁll one’s moral obligations as a pious Muslim. For salvation to be complete, it must
be perfected. But salvation is not an all-or-nothing proposition. It is a process of drawing
ever nearer to God, which process involves becoming more God-like in one’s deeds. Here
is where faith and works combine to effect salvation.

Therefore, the requirements of the Qurān for the true believer may be described, in
Christian terms, as a “faith of works.” In other words, Islam is ideally a “faith at work”
(in Christian terms, a “way of life”) and thus a “faith that works” – for the beneﬁt of
individual and society alike. If, as Christians often say, “faith without works is dead,”
the “faith with works” is very much alive. This is the spiritual life that Islam breathes
into the physical lives of pious Muslims. Readers may be familiar with the way in which
Martin Luther dichotomized faith and works. Individuals would not be “saved” by
unaided efforts, but by faith alone. Islam has no such doctrine of salvation by grace.
The most efﬁcacious grace is not to give up on the sinner and allow another to die in
his place as in Christianity. The better way is to promote the spiritual and moral growth
of the individual. This takes discipline as well as a certain amount of faith. Daily oblig-
atory prayer and following the laws and precepts of the Qurān is the truest salvation
by grace, because works and faith combine to become, in the words of the beloved spir-
itual, “Amazing Grace.”

Civilization

Salvation is not just for the individual. There is collective salvation as well. The purpose
of the Qurān is to communicate God’s will for humankind – all of humanity. Through
its laws and moral principles, the Qurān is meant to beneﬁt the world through restruc-
turing human society, to infuse it with the consciousness of God and to make it alive
to the will of God for human society. It is a call to righteousness and brotherhood, to
human solidarity in a community of principle and commonality of values. The Qurān
is nothing less than an attempt to reorder human society, to rescue it, Muslims would
say, from the moral appetites and turpitude that threaten to make the West morally
uncivilized while remaining technologically advanced. Islam offers to ﬁll a spiritual
vacuum to which Western society has largely turned a blind eye. Islamic spirituality
can be harmonized with the best of Western – Christian as well as contemporary
secular – traditions of civic virtues, of moral decency and of family values, informed
by the West’s traditional Judeo-Christian ethic. Just as the biblical “ten command-
ments” are still relevant, the Qurān still has much to say, although even some Muslims

would say that it needs to be understood anew within the changed circumstances of
modernity and postmodernity.

Final destination

Few other sacred texts depict the afterlife so vividly as the Qurān. Whether literal or
metaphorical, paradise is described as the abode of the righteous, dwelling in peace in
Edenic gardens inhabited by dark-eyed damsels that seem to represent higher passions
rather than lower ones. Conversely, the Qurān portrays hell in equally graphic
terms, as a pit of ﬁre and brimstone, with a descriptive immediacy that the sermons of
Jonathan Edwards can scarcely rival. Indeed, it is said that around a full one-third
of the Qurān is eschatological, dealing with the afterlife in the next world and with
the day of judgment here on earth at the end of time. As in Christianity, the day of
resurrection plays a prominent role in the Qurān with a focus on inevitable
moral accountability, both individual and collective in nature. Through promise and
threat, the Qurān instills a healthy fear of God in the believer, who is constantly
taught to respect divine authority and to expect the consequences of one’s own
actions.

Reading Revelation

The Qurān presents a number of challenges for interpreter and reader alike.
Many Western readers have complained that the Qurān is dull and repetitive. If the
Qurān were read as a novel from cover to cover, there might be some truth to this. But
just as the Qurān was revealed in piecemeal fashion, so also should it be read. The ﬁnal
redaction of the Qurān obscures this fact. There are few obvious markers that will
signal, to the untrained eye, the beginning and end of various discrete, revelatory sec-
tions known as pericopes. The best examples of a piece of revelation preserved in its
entirety and discretely identiﬁable would be most of what are known as the early
Meccan sūras.

The Qurān was not intended to be read as a book in one or two sittings. The more
that one reads, the more the reader will have the sense that the Qurān repeats itself.
Some expressions recur like a refrain. They have a rhetorical purpose, in that they are
repeated for stress. The reiterative nature of the Qurān notwithstanding, certain pas-
sages have achieved such renown that they have come to be known as what al-Ghazālı̄
(d. 505/1111) referred to as the “jewels of the Qurān.” These include such celebrated
passages as the “throne verse” (Q 2:255) and the “light verse” (Q 24:35).

Shifting from the mystical to the perplexing, some Qurānic passages defy easy expla-
nation. The most obvious examples are the so-called “mysterious letters of the Qurān,”
which occur at the very beginning of twenty-nine chapters. Muslims themselves often
have a mystical relationship with the Qurān that does not require that they under-
stand the text, divine its enigmas or derive mystical meaning by probing its depths. In
popular or “folk” Islam, instead of trying to divine its truths, Muslims may turn to the

Qurān as a source of divination. One common practice is to consult the Qurān as a
kind of oracle. If a person wishes to know the solution to a personal problem, he or she
can look to the Qurān for personal guidance by carefully meditating on the passage
that ﬁrst falls into view.

It is instructive enough simply to be able to see the different modes of discourse that
give texture and vitality to the Qurān. Although the Qurān does not have a deﬁnite
structure in any kind of systematic method, it has a complex of structures within it.
These have been identiﬁed in various ways by Muslim and Western scholars alike. One
way to discern the various shifts in revelatory content is to perform a genre analysis of
a sūra or part of a sūra in question. The major genres, or the various styles of Qurānic
revelations, are as follows.

Prophetic revelations

A narrative is simply a story. If the story is true, it qualiﬁes as history. Some narratives
have a purely edifying (instructive) function. Whether historically veriﬁable or not, all
of the Qurānic narratives are morally true. Such a distinction will probably be lost on
those pious Muslims who take the sacred text at its word (literally). Take for instance
the story of Jesus as a young boy. The Qurān states that, as a child, Jesus would fashion
birds out of mud, then breathe life into them, and the birds would ﬂy away:

> And He [Jesus] will teach him the book, the wisdom, the Torah, the Gospel, to be a mes-
> senger to the Children of Israel saying, “I have come to you with a sign from your Lord.
> I will create for you out of clay as the likeness of a bird; then I will breathe into it, and it
> will be a bird, by the leave of God. I will also heal the blind and the leper, and bring to life
> the dead, by the leave of God.” (Q 3:43)

Despite the abundance of miracle narratives in the four gospels, this particular prodi-
gious ability of Jesus is unreported in the gospels found today in the New Testament.
Thus, as the Qurān itself states, some stories it relates may be traced back to previous
scriptures, and some not. This is a case of one that is not.

Prophetic narratives are what they purport to be – stories of the prophets. The
Qurān has many such narratives. Indeed, the Qurān speaks much more about past
prophets than about the prophet Muh.ammad himself. These narratives, for the most
part, are partial, even fragmentary. The only complete prophetic narrative in the
Qurān is the sūra of Joseph (Q 12). The nature of these narratives is referential and
homiletic. They serve an edifying purpose.

Many of the Qurān’s prophetic narratives will no doubt be familiar to readers who
are conversant with the Hebrew scriptures and the New Testament. However, in addi-
tion to the “new” material on Jesus just mentioned, the Qurān contains many other
stories that are not to be found anywhere in the Bible. For many readers, this adds to
the Qurān’s mystique. Whether such stories are those of Moses and Khid. r (Q 18), the
story of the Seven Sleepers (Q 18), or other nonbiblical narratives that add to the overall
impression, the reader must not assume that these stories are untrue or merely

apocryphal. Whether they are or not is not the point. For Muslims, the Qurān conﬁrms
much material found in previous scriptures, and adds new material as well. Even if such
stories may be found in Jewish lore or elsewhere, it is safe to say that the Qurān pre-
sents these as morally true and as paradigmatically important. The stories are author-
itative and, by virtue of their status as revelation, are true for Muslims howsoever they
may be nuanced or explained.

Edifying revelations

While the majority of narratives are stories of the prophets, other narratives have a
purely edifying purpose. One example is the Qurān’s use of parables. These function
in quite the same way as the parables of Jesus. Maxims, aphorisms, and other wisdom
sayings enrich the didactic dimension of the Qurān. This material regulates the lives
of Muslims in ways that laws cannot. Laws may govern outward actions, and conform
them to moral and religious standards. But the Qurānic wisdom literature is the heart
of piety, which can take on mystical dimensions not contemplated by observant praxis
alone.

Legal revelations

As stated earlier, the Qurān is one of the two major sources of Islamic law. The other
is the h.adı̄th literature, which is a body of traditions that report the extra-canonical
sayings and actions of Muh.ammad. Together, the Qurān and h.adı̄th make up the
sunna, the way of the prophet, which, in turn, becomes the sharı̄ a, the code that
Muslims should follow. If the Qurān is the revealed word of God, then the life and
sayings of Muh.ammad represent the will of God. Muh.ammad is the perfect Muslim.
Therefore, the pious Muslim will try to emulate the prophet in just about every way,
beyond his singularly prophetic mission.

Given the harsh realities of the day, the Qurān can at times be uncompromising.

Some of its corporeal punishments are objectionable and unacceptable in the modern
world today. Some Muslim reformers advocate dispensing with the letter of certain
Islamic laws yet preserving principles and social goals that stand behind them.

Liturgical revelations

The Qurān has liturgical value because it is used in private and public worship. Among
the many and varied devotional uses of the Qurān, the ﬁrst sūra is used in daily oblig-
atory prayer (s.alāt). Qurānic recitation – that is, chanting the verses of the Qurān
according to stylized canons of intonation and cadence – became an art-form in itself,
just like Qurānic calligraphy. In a sense, Qurānic recitation re-enacts those original,
revelatory moments of the spoken Qurān as they were ﬁrst dictated by Muh.ammad to
his scribes.

The Qurān loses much of its force on the barren printed page. Emotions thrill to the
spirited invocation of Qurānic passages, as a whole religious culture comes alive. One
does not have to know Arabic to be struck by the emotional depth that is conveyed by
Qurānic recitation. The hearts of the pious are swept with awe and fascination by the
measured accents of the text, as it is experienced in the depth of the soul.

Polemical revelations

To promote Islam is also to defend it. Secular as well as religious charges were leveled
at the prophet of Islam. Muh.ammad was variously accused of being a crazed poet,
soothsayer, or sorcerer, as well as a liar. In all of these cases, Qurānic polemics are to
be seen as both actual and theoretical. They may be historical and localized, or doctri-
nal and generalized. Sometimes the Qurān directly cites the charges it refutes. The
important thing to remember is that the Qurān, despite its exalted claims to revelation,
is personalized through the formative experience of Islam as a historical movement.
Muh.ammad and the early Muslims faced challenges, debates, and outright persecution.
Under these circumstances, polemics served an immediate purpose, yet had a paradig-
matic value as Islam spread to countries outside Arabia, where Islam was just as new
then as before.

Another aspect of Qurānic polemics is apologetic in nature. Among the detractors
of Islam were Jewish communities. This fact becomes problematic in the modern
context and has fueled charges of a latent Muslim anti-Semitism. The many references
to Judaism, however, are for instructive purposes, and a much greater focus is placed
on the prophethood of Moses, who is really a prototype of Muh.ammad himself.

The Qurān has a certain degree of affection for Christians. During times of perse-
cution in the early days of Islam, Christians tended to be the most sympathetic of
onlookers. Muslims share a great deal in common with Christians. However, the Qurān
brooks no tolerance for the Christian doctrine of the trinity. Although the
Qurān afﬁrms the virgin birth, it does not accord Jesus the status of the son of God
(nor that of God, for that matter). The Qurān also views original sin as absolute injus-
tice and complete predestination. Pure Christianity is pure Islam, since there is only one
true religion. What would Jesus do if he met Muh.ammad? Muslims would say that Jesus
would embrace the truth of Muh.ammad’s revelation, considering the fact that the
Qurān states that Jesus prophesied the advent of Muh.ammad.

Assessing the Qur>ān

Is the Qurān a revelation sent down by God, as Muslims claim? This is clearly a theo-
logical question. If the answer were yes, Christians and others might feel compelled to
become Muslims. The simplest solution is to recognize Islam for what it is – a system of
salvation at the center of which is the Qurān, which is functionally and effectively the
word of God, entirely independent of what non-Muslims have to say about its truth
claims. The Qurān invites all humanity to respond to the call of God. It sees itself as

the latest and fullest testimony of God and the most direct expression of the divine
purpose for humanity. This is a monumental truth-claim, and must be taken very seri-
ously when studying the text. Readers will wish to keep this salient fact in mind because
it goes far to explain the power of the Qurān to command allegiance and serve as the
effective constitution of entire Islamic societies.

An understanding of the Qurān is analogous to music appreciation, although
saying so is by no means meant to trivialize the purpose or process of gaining that
understanding. Muslims have a coherent worldview, one that originates from the
Qurān itself. To appreciate the Qurān is to develop a sensitivity to the operation of
the divine in a culture removed for centuries from the Euro-American world but now
increasingly an integral part of it. One can only gain from such an understanding.
Indeed, one can only be enriched by it, but only if one’s prejudices are ﬁrst abandoned.
The Qurān is a world unto itself, a palatial architecture of meaning that is multidi-
mensional and comprehends the totality of the human experience. On the moral and
spiritual foundation of the Qurān, an entire history and civilization has been built. The
West can continue to clash with Islam – which is the religion of the Qurān – or
embrace it.

To acknowledge the beauty and depth of the Qurān is not to convert to Islam, but
to converse with it and with Muslims who are enlivened by it. Yes, the Qurān is a text
of monumental historical importance. But it may have an even greater contemporary
relevance, for in an increasing number of Western nations the population of Muslims
is beginning to surpass the number of Jews. Thus the religion of Islam is rapidly
entrenching itself as a French religion, as part of UK society, as a feature of the
Canadian mosaic, and as an essential element of the spiritual landscape of the United
States.

To know the Qurān is to better prepare oneself for inevitable encounters with
Muslims both in America and abroad – not as the exotic “other” somewhere in the
distant Orient, but as the religion and way of life of our fellow compatriots at home –
friends, neighbors and, through increasing religious intermarriage, that of our imme-
diate and extended families. The events of September 11, 2001 have riveted world
attention on Islam (albeit radical Islam). Sales of the Qurān and texts on Islam have
skyrocketed.

For the non-Muslim, reading the Qurān is an act of moderation, a signiﬁcant form
of communication, an act of intellectual and perhaps spiritual empathy, and, for some,
a religious moment without a religious commitment, and a gesture of understanding.
It is an act of humanity. Moreover, the Qurān is a text of world-historical proportions
that institutions of higher learning can scarcely afford to ignore, because our domes-
tic life, as well as international affairs, will be increasingly informed by it. Discovering
the Qurān on a personal basis can be rewarding for its own sake. Studying the Qurān
will equip university students with a competence they are sure to ﬁnd useful in an
increasingly multicultural world, one-ﬁfth of which is already under Islam’s spiritual,
political, and cultural authority – with an even greater part of the world affected by it.
The US courts have already weighed in on the University of North Carolina Qurān con-
troversy. While reading the Qurān cannot be required, it is required reading for reli-

gious, political, cultural, and global literacy. In its own way, it is a democratic as well
as academic enterprise.
