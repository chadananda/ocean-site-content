> birth of The Bab
> Sayyid Ali-Muhammad, known by his spiritual title as the "Bab" (the "Gate"), was born on October 20, 1819, in
> Shiraz, Persia (now Iran). The Bab was the founder of a 19th-century new religious movement generally known
> as Babism. The Bab declared himself to be the long-awaited Qá'im (Ariser/Resurrector), the expected
> eschatological deliverer (known in both Shia and Sunni Islam as the Mahdi), who, according to Islamic tradition,
> would come to revive Islam when it was at its lowest ebb. While proclaiming himself to be an independent
> "Manifestation of God," the Bab also spoke of the imminent advent of the Promised One, or "Him whom God shall
> make manifest." One of the Bab's followers, Bahá'u'lláh, would later receive revelations confirming that he was
> that Promised One heralded by the Bab.
> Armin Eschraghi has argued that the new faith proclaimed by the Bab fulfilled all the criteria of an independent
> religion: a new founder, newly revealed scriptures, a new set of metaphysical and theological teachings distinct
> from those of Islam, new religious laws and principles. In revealing his new code of laws (called the Bayán), the
> Bab pursued three major goals: (1) paving the way for the advent of the Promised One; (2) provoking the clerical
> establishment and shattering the foundations of their often-abused institutionalized authority; and (3) proving the
> independence of his own religion as distinct from Islam.

> Soon after the Bab publicly proclaimed his prophetic mission beginning on the evening of May 22, 1844, the
> Islamic government then in power in Persia began to suppress the movement and violence ensued. The Bab was
> arrested and executed by a firing squad of 750 musketeers on July 9, 1850, in Tabríz, Persia. Subsequent to an
> unauthorized and ill-fated attempt on the life of the shah of Persia in 1852, the shah ordered the most brutal
> tortures and deaths of a great number of Bábís, with estimates ranging from around 5,000 to 20,000 martyrs.

> In the fall of 1852, in the wake of the Bab's execution, Bahá'u'lláh was imprisoned in the notorious Siyáh-Chál
> (Black Pit), during which time he experienced a series of visions that awakened him to his prophetic destiny. He
> was released, but banished—exiled successively to Baghdad (1853–1863), Constantinople/Istanbul (1863),
> Adrianople/Edirne (1863–1868), and finally to the prison-city of 'Akká, considered the vilest penal colony of the
> Ottoman Empire. In 1892, Bahá'u'lláh passed away in Bahjí, near 'Akká in Palestine (now Israel).

> In his article on "Babism" published that same year, Professor Browne wrote: "I say nothing of the mighty
> influence which, as I believe, the Bábí faith will exert in the future, nor of the new life it may perchance breathe
> into a dead people; for, whether it succeed or fail, the splendid heroism of the Bábí martyrs is a thing eternal and
> indestructible." The "Bábí faith" that Browne spoke of evolved into the Baha'i Faith, which has since spread
> worldwide to become the most widely diffused world religion next to Christianity, according to the 2001 World
> Christian Encyclopedia.

> Today, Baha'is accept the Bab as a John the Baptist figure, whose words and actions heralded the arrival of
> Bahá'u'lláh. However, unlike John the Baptist, the Bab revealed much in substance, both in terms of doctrine and
> religious laws, that was subsequently revoiced and reenacted, with certain revisions, by Bahá'u'lláh.

> The Bab did not instruct his followers to formally observe the day of his birth; however, for that occasion,
> Bahá'u'lláh had revealed the Lawh-i Mawlúd, which awaits an authorized translation. Today, Baha'is worldwide
> annually celebrate the birth of the Bab on October 20 as a holy day, with work and school suspended for the day.
> There being no required observances, Baha'is are free to creatively organize commemorative activities which,
> although attended mostly by Baha'is, are open to people of all faiths and persuasions.
