**About the book:** _Religions of the World_ (Second Edition), in six volumes, brings together the scholarship of experts from around the globe. The encyclopedia offers entries on every country of the world, with particular emphasis both on the larger nations as well as profiles on religion in some of the world's most remote places (e.g. Antarctica and Easter Island). This collection is unique in that it is based in religion "on the ground," tracing the development of each of the 16 major world religious traditions through its institutional expressions in the modern world, its major geographical sites, and its major celebrations.

Temples—Baha’i Faith

The Baha’i temple—known as a Mashriqu’l-Adhkar,
literally the “Dawning Place of the Praise [of God]”—
is one of the institutions conceived by Bahá’u’lláh, the
founder of the Baha’i Faith. Mashriqu’l-Adhkar is a
term with several meanings, depending on context, and
can variously refer to: (1) a gathering of Baha’is en-
gaged in devotion to God, especially at dawn; (2) any
building dedicated to such worship (as in Iran and the
Transcaspian Territory in Russia, where many Baha’i
communities designated ordinary houses in their local
communities as Mashriqu’l-Adhkars); (3) the complex
of institutions surrounding a central house of worship
that Bahá’u’lláh ordained to be at the very heart of
every Baha’i community; or (4) the central house of
worship itself. The only Baha’i temples that exist at        Baha’i temple and gardens in Haifa. (Hitmans/Dreamstime

Baha’i houses of worship will, in successive stages,
be built in the future, as circumstances and resources
allow.                                                            Baha’i temples are not the only places of Baha’i
