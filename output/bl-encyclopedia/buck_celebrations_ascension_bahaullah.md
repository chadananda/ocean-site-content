**About the book:** _Religious Celebrations,_ ed. J. Gordon Melton, with James A. Beverley, Christopher Buck, and Constance A. Jones, covers more than 800 celebratory occasions from all of the world's major religious communities as well as many of the minor faith traditions. The two-volume encyclopedia provides a complete reference tool for examining the myriad ways people celebrate their religious lives across religious boundaries, providing information on numerous celebratory activities. Offering the most comprehensive coverage of religious holidays ever assembled, this book covers festivals, commemorations, holidays, and annual religious gatherings all over the world. Entries written by specialists on different religious communities capture the unique intensity of each event, be it fasting or feasting, frenzied activity or the universal cessation of work, a huge gathering of the faithful en masse or a small family-centered event.

> abstaining from passions of the self to become more compassionate toward others.
> The nineteen-day Bahá’ı́ Fast, therefore, is an ideal preparation for the Bahá’ı́
> New Year (Naw-Rúz, lit. “New Day”) that immediately follows the Fast, when
> the vernal equinox heralds a new springtime of personal and social renewal, both
physical and spiritual.

> (now Israel). Local Bahá’ı́ communities worldwide therefore gather at that time

> ally culminating in the chanting in Arabic, or recitation in translation, of what is
> known as the “Tablet of Visitation,” a special prayer reserved for the commemora-
tion of Bahá’u’lláh, as well as the Báb.

A telegram bearing the news, “The Sun of Bahá’ has set,” was immediately dis-
> patched by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (1844–1921), Bahá’u’lláh’s eldest son and successor), to
Sultán ‘Abdu’l-Hamı́d, with a request for permission to bury Bahá’u’lláh at Bahjı́,

˙            ˙
> which was granted. Bahá’u’lláh was interred shortly after sunset, on the very day
of his ascension.

Where the sacred remains of Bahá’u’lláh are interred is now known as the
Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh—a building that, in 2008, was designated a UNESCO World

Heritage Site along with the Shrine of the Báb, making these two Bahá’ı́ sacred
sites the first modern religious edifices to be so distinguished. By virtue of their
outstanding value to humanity, World Heritage Sites belong to all the peoples of
the world.

Of far greater moment, however, is Bahá’u’lláh’s contribution to a future world
heritage of global unity and world peace, culminating in a golden age envisioned
and promised by Bahá’u’lláh himself. One example of this promise appears in
Cambridge scholar Edward Granville Browne’s historic meeting with Bahá’u’lláh,
in 1890:

> Thou hast come to see a prisoner and an exile. . . . We desire but the good of
> the world and the happiness of the nations. . . . That all nations should
> become one in faith and all men as brothers; that the bonds of affection and
> unity between the sons of men should be strengthened; that diversity of reli-
> gion should cease, and differences of race be annulled—what harm is there
> in this? . . . Yet so it shall be; these fruitless strifes, these ruinous wars shall
> pass away, and the “Most Great Peace” shall come. . . . These strifes and this
> bloodshed and discord must cease, and all men be as one kindred and one
> family. Let not a man glory in this, that he loves his country; let him rather
> glory in this, that he loves his kind. (Browne, A Traveller’s Narrative, xl)

After the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh, his eldest son ‘Abdu’l-Bahá became the
appointed “Centre of the Covenant” (successor to Bahá’u’lláh), pursuant to provi-
sions of Bahá’u’lláh’s Most Holy Book and the Kitáb-i-‘Ahd (“Book of the
Covenant”), which is Bahá’u’lláh’s last will and testament, written entirely in
his own hand. Nine days after Bahá’u’lláh’s ascension, this singularly important
document was shown to the local Bahá’ı́s and read in their presence. The passage
conferring successorship upon ‘Abdu’l-Bahá is as follows:

> The Will of the divine Testator is this: It is incumbent upon the Aghsán, the
> Afnán and My kindred to turn, one and all, their faces towards the Most
> Mighty Branch. Consider that which We have revealed in Our Most Holy
> Book: “When the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of My
> Revelation is ended, turn your faces toward Him Whom God hath purposed,
> Who hath branched from this Ancient Root.” The object of this sacred Verse
> is none other except the Most Mighty Branch [‘Abdu’l-Bahá]. (Bahá’u’lláh,
> Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, 221)

Significantly, the text of this document was made available to the scholarly
community by Russian orientalist Aleksandr Toumansky (1861–1920), who pub-
lished the original Persian text, along with a Russian translation. At the same time,
Toumansky also published a poem, “Lament,” by the acclaimed Bahá’ı́ poet, Mı́rzá
‘Alı́-Ashraf Láhijánı́, known as “ ‘Andalib” (the “Nightingale”) who writes, in part:

> Today the cupbearer, by God’s design,
> poured bile into the cup of life, not wine. . . .
> Through Him the Day of Resurrection dawned:
> Now earth quakes at the setting of His Sun. . . .
> We’ll never hear His voice again, but there
> the Nightingale of Paradise flies free. (Translated by Ahang Rabbani and
> Anthony Lee, in Momen, Baha’u’llah: A Short Biography, 154–55)

Throughout the world’s religious history, the death of the founder has typically
> precipitated a crisis over successorship. The Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh, however,
> was immediately followed by the succession of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as leader of the Bahá’ı́
> community, as authorized “Interpreter” of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings, and as the “Per-
> fect Exemplar” of Bahá’ı́ virtues. This clear transition, ordained in Bahá’u’lláh’s
> written testament, preserved the integrity of the Bahá’ı́ community and protected it
from the perils of schism.

The Universal House of Justice, the international governing body of the global
> Bahá’ı́ community, declared the period from April 1992 to April 1993 as the sec-
> ond “Bahá’ı́ Holy Year” to mark both the centenary itself and the inauguration
> of the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh in November 1892. On May 29, 1992, the cente-
> nary of Bahá’u’lláh’s passing, several thousand Bahá’ı́s from more than 200 coun-
> tries gathered to pay homage to Bahá’u’lláh at the Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh, which
> is adjacent to the Mansion of Bahjı́, located near Old Acre on Israel’s northern
coast.

Some Bahá’ı́s arrange, through the Office of Pilgrimage at the Bahá’ı́ World
> Centre in Haifa, Israel, to schedule their pilgrimages around the time of the Birth
> or Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh. During their pilgrimage, Bahá’ı́s visit the Shrine of
> Bahá’u’lláh. In commemorating the Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh, Bahá’ı́s worldwide
> transport themselves, in mind and heart, to the resting place of Bahá’u’lláh, in
> what may be thought of as a virtual pilgrimage by the estimated 5.5 million adher-
ents of the Bahá’ı́ Faith in the world today.

Bahá’ı́s may individually or collectively commemorate the Ascension of
> Bahá’u’lláh with prayers and readings as befit the occasion, often followed by
> refreshments and fellowship in a dignified manner. Among the Bahá’ı́ readings,
> of special relevance to this occasion include: Nabı́l’s account of the ascension of
> Bahá’u’lláh; the Tablet of Visitation of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh; the “Book of
> the Covenant” (Bahá’u’lláh’s last will and testament, appointing ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as
> successor); passages in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas relating to the succession of ‘Abdu’l-
> Bahá; the “Tablet of the Branch”; and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s first message to the Bahá’ı́s,
> announcing Bahá’u’lláh’s ascension, advising Bahá’ı́s not to be disconsolate, and
to remain steadfast.

The Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh is of special moment, commemorating the life
> and contributions of a great religious figure in modern history, whose shrine has
been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and whose universal principles

Bahá’u’lláh, Festival of the Birth of (November 12)           99

of world unity may, in the course of time, be recognized as an enduring contribu-
tion to the world’s heritage.

Bahá’u’lláh, Festival of the Birth of (November 12)

The Festival of the Birth of Bahá’u’lláh is one of five Bahá’ı́ festivals, and one of
the nine Bahá’ı́ holy days on which work is to be suspended. It is a joyous occa-
sion, for it celebrates the historic birth of the prophet-founder of the Bahá’ı́ Faith,
whose prophetic role as the “World-Reformer” and “World-Unifier” is at the core
of Bahá’ı́ belief regarding the person and work of Bahá’u’lláh.

In “founded” religions, the birth of the founder is accorded historic and reli-
gious importance. Beyond their intrinsic and honorific significance, the birth and
childhood of Bahá’u’lláh relate to the birth of the Bahá’ı́ Faith, in that certain
childhood experiences are said to have had a formative influence. What is singular
about the birth of Bahá’u’lláh is that it is part of a double religious holy day, called
“the Festival of the Twin Birthdays.”
The Bahá’ı́ Faith was founded by Mı́rzá Husayn-‘Alı́ Núrı́, known by his spiri-

˙
tual title, Bahá’u’lláh (1817–1892), and by Sayyid ‘Alı́-Muhammad of Shiraz

(1819–1850), better known as the Báb (“the Gate”), who claimed to be the Qá’im
