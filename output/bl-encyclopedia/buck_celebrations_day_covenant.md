> fragrance. Its wine-offering is one fourth of a hin. Bread, parched grain or tender
> grain you shall not eat until this very day, until you bring the offering of your
G-d; it is an everlasting statute for all your generations in all your dwelling places.

You shall count for yourselves, from the day after the day of rest (Pesach)
> from the day on which you will bring the omer wave-offering, seven com-
> plete weeks they shall be, until the day after the seventh week, you shall
> count fifty days, and you shall bring a new meal-offering to Ad-noy.

In years past, prior to the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple, on the day after
Passover, an omer of grain would be was brought to the temple as an offering.
Today, beginning the second night of Passover, the observant Jews will recite a
blessing prayer and state the count on the days since Passover. The period of the
counting is also considered a time of partial mourning, in memory of a large num-
ber of the students of Rabbi Akiba Ben Josef (c. 50–c. 135 CE) who died in a
plague. The observant will refrain from planning marriages, parties, and haircuts
during this time. On Lag b’Omer, the 33rd day of the count, there is a minor break
in the observance to remember the achievements of one of Rabbi Akiba’s students,
and the mourning rules are lifted for that day.

The counting of Omer begins on the Sunday evening of the day after Passover
(remembering that in the Hebrew calendar, the new day began at sundown).

The Day of the Covenant is a Bahá’ı́ holy day honoring the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh
and, in particular, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (1844–1921) as the “Centre of the Covenant.”
This festival is observed alongside the nine Bahá’ı́ holy days on which work is to
be suspended.

The Day of the Covenant pays tribute to the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh, a matter
of signal importance to Bahá’ı́s, in that it is the key to the integrity of the Bahá’ı́
religion. By preserving and perpetuating its indivisibility, the Covenant estab-
lished by Bahá’u’lláh protects the Bahá’ı́ religion from schism. In anticipation of
his eventual passing, Bahá’u’lláh called on all Bahá’ı́s to turn to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá

> (Bahá’u’lláh’s eldest son) as successor (inerrant leader of the Bahá’ı́ community),
> interpreter (authorized exponent of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings), and exemplar (per-
> fect embodiment of Bahá’ı́ virtues and morality). This triple function has been as
> powerful in its influence on the future course and fortunes of the Bahá’ı́ commu-
> nity as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s station is conceptually and functionally distinctive, and
remains so.

Beyond ‘Abdu’l-Bahá himself, the Bahá’ı́ Covenant extends to Shoghi Effendi
> (1897–1957), Guardian of the Faith from 1921 until his passing in 1957, and sub-
> sequently to the Universal House of Justice, the Bahá’ı́ international council,
> elected every five years by national representatives of Bahá’ı́ communities world-
> wide since its establishment in April 1963. Despite efforts by individuals who
> sought to aggrandize themselves by claiming authority, the Bahá’ı́ community is
an organically unified faith-community, free of schisms or factions.

Historically, the Day of the Covenant was established by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in order
> to discontinue the practice of early believers who, on their own initiative, used to
> celebrate his birthday. In a number of locales, the Bahá’ı́s, beyond celebrating
> his birthday, also observed the day on which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá acceded to the leader-
> ship of the Bahá’ı́ community as the designated successor to Bahá’u’lláh (1817–
> 1892), who passed away on May 29, 1892. Honoring ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s birthday
> was problematic particularly because of this remarkable historical coincidence:
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was born on May 22, 1844, which, in fact, was the very same night
> that the Báb declared his prophetic mission. So, in order not to divert focus from
> the anniversary of the Declaration of the Báb, which was a sacred event,
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá chose November 26 for commemorating the inauguration of
> Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant. According to Bahá’ı́ historian Hasan M. Balyuzi:

> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá told the Bahá’ı́s that this day [May 22] was not, under any
> circumstances, to be celebrated as His day of birth. It was the day of the Dec-
> laration of the Báb, exclusively associated with Him. But as the Bahá’ı́s
> begged for a day to be celebrated as His, He gave them November 26th, to
> be observed as the day of the appointment of the Centre of the Covenant. It
was known as Jashn-i A‘z am (The Greatest Festival), because He was

˙
Ghusn-i A‘zam—the Greatest Branch. In the West it is known as the Day of

˙       ˙
> the Covenant. (Balyuzi, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: The Centre of the Covenant of
> Bahá’u’lláh, 523; brackets added)

The “Most Mighty Branch” is the spiritual title given to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá by
> Bahá’u’lláh in the latter’s Will and Testament—known as the “Book of the
> Covenant” (Kitáb-i ‘Ahd). Of this historic document, Shoghi Effendi wrote: “Writ-
> ten entirely in His own hand . . . this unique and epoch-making Document, desig-
> nated by Bahá’u’lláh as His ‘Most Great Tablet,’ and alluded to by Him as the
> ‘Crimson Book’ in His ‘Epistle to the Son of the Wolf,’ can find no parallel in the
Scriptures of any previous Dispensation” (Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, 238).

‘Abdu’l-Bahá purposely selected a date that is six months (i.e., 180 days) on the
Common Era calendar away from the commemoration of Bahá’u’lláh’s Ascen-
sion, which temporal distancing entirely removed any formal association between
those two observances. In the East, the Day of the Covenant also became known as
the “Day of Accession” (Yawm-i Julús). In the West, this occasion was first cel-
ebrated in 1910, when it was first known as the “Fete-Day of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá” or
“the Master’s Day,” before it eventually came to be called the “Day of the
Covenant.” (Walbridge, Sacred Acts, 244–45.)

There are no required observances for this occasion. Typically, the believers
(and their invited friends) gather together for a devotional service of prayers and
readings from the sacred Bahá’ı́ writings, often interspersed with musical inter-
ludes, and usually followed by fellowship and refreshments. The Day of the
Covenant, therefore, commemorates the unique Bahá’ı́ Covenant. Shoghi Effendi
claimed that “nowhere in the books pertaining to any of the world’s religious sys-
tems . . . do we find any single document establishing a Covenant endowed with an
authority comparable to the Covenant which Bahá’u’lláh had Himself instituted”
(Effendi, God Passes By, 238).

On the Day of the Covenant, Bahá’ı́s honor ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as the “Perfect Exem-
plar” of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings and as the “Centre of the Covenant” of Bahá’u’lláh,
paying tribute to that sacred Covenant, which historically safeguarded and will
continue to preserve the unity of the Bahá’ı́ faith-community for centuries to
come.
