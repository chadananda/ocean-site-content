Dissimulation of the faith was widespread among Babis and Bahais until the early years of the ministry of Shoghi Effendi (1921-57), when he, in a number of messages starting in 1927, prohibited its practice.

On different occasions the Bāb had advocated the time-honored practice among his followers  (Nabil, pp.  44, 65, 373; Amanat, pp. 200-201).  Due to the persecution of his adherents, Bahāʾ-Allāh also advocated dissimulation of the faith in a number of his scriptural writings.  In a tablet produced after the execution of Badīʿ, his messenger to Nāṣer-al-Din Shah, Bahāʾ-Allāh ordained _taqiya_ (_amr-e taqiya nāzel_) and advised his followers to restrain from confessing their faith (_amr be ʿadam-e eqrār ṣāder_), in order to protect and preserve them.  Besides _taqiya_, the terms _setr_ (concealment), _ḥejāb_ (veil) and _ḥekmat_ (wisdom) are also used in this context as synonyms for dissimulation (Fāżel Māzandarāni, III, pp. 118-19).   The order to practice taqiya is also confirmed in a similar tablet in reply to questions raised by the Bahais of Māzandarān.  As in the aforementioned tablet, Bahāʾ-Allāh reiterates a Tradition of Imam [Jaʿfar al-Ṣādeq](http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/jafar-al-sadeq), who reportedly had said**:** “taqiya is my religion and the religion of my forefathers,” and urged his followers to conceal their faith: _ḥokm-e setr nāzel_ (_Payām-e Bahāʾi_ 307, June 2005, pp. 43-44).

Taqiya was practiced by Bahais during this period as a matter of course.  Many traveled in disguise, prayed as Muslims, and were often not aware of the identities of their co-religionists.  This practice continued unabatedly during the ministry of  ʿAbd-al-Bahāʾ (1892-1921). Bahāʾ-Allāh and ʿAbd-al-Bahāʾ, as well as their intimate companions, were generally regarded to be Muslims, even among resident Europeans. To the German Templers, who had come at the same time as Bahāʾ-Allāh to Palestine expecting the near advent of Christ and who lived as close neighbors of the Bahais in Haifa, both ʿAbd-al-Bahāʾ and his father had “remained Muhammedans” (Lange, p. 12).  In only very rare cases were they perceived to be propounders of a new religion.  They kept to Muslim traditions and rites, prayed in the mosque, and fasted during Ramadan (Fāżel Māzandarāni, III, p. 118).  ʿAbd-al-Bahāʾ himself urged his followers on different occasions to practice _ḥekmat_ and abide by taqiya: _ʿalaykom be’t-taqiyya_ (ʿAbd-al-Bahāʾ, pp. 325-27).
