94    Bahá’ı́ Fast (March 2–20)

> reciting the word of God twice daily in order to connect the believer to the
revelation.

The horizontal dimension of the devotional life has various aspects. Bahá’u’lláh
> says Bahá’ı́s should be “anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in,
> and center your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements” (Gleanings from
> the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh, selection CVI). Bahá’ı́s are thus encouraged, indi-
vidually and collectively, to improve the world around them.

> Most world religions include the practice of fasting, and many include times of
> community-wide fasting. The Bahá’ı́ Faith has such a period of communal fasting
> that occurs each March 2–20. The Fast follows Ayyám-i-Há, the Bahá’ı́ Interca-
lary Days, and is itself followed by the Festival of Naw-Rúz.

The Fast was ordained by Bahá’u’lláh (1817–1892), the prophet-founder of the
> Bahá’ı́ Faith, and elaborated on by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (1844–1921), the eldest son, and
> the successor and interpreter of Bahá’u’lláh. During the 19-day fast, the believer
abstains from food and drink from sunrise to sunset, and remains mindful of God

and of the divine purpose for human existence. Both Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá extolled the virtue of the Fast:

> All praise be unto God, Who hath revealed the law of obligatory prayer as a
> reminder to His servants, and enjoined on them the Fast that those possessed
> of means may become apprised of the woes and sufferings of the destitute.

(Bahá’u’lláh, The Importance of Obligatory Prayer and Fasting, II)

> Verily, I say, fasting is the supreme remedy and the most great healing for the
> disease of self and passion. (Bahá’u’lláh, The Importance of Obligatory
> Prayer and Fasting, XVII)

> This Fast leadeth to the cleansing of the soul from all selfish desires, the
> acquisition of spiritual attributes, attraction to the breezes of the All-
> Merciful, and enkindlement with the fire of divine love. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, The
> Importance of Obligatory Prayer and Fasting, XXVI)

Fasting is binding on men and women from the age of spiritual maturity
(15 years). Those exempt from the requirement of fasting include, inter alia: (1)
travelers, if the journey exceeds nine hours; (2) those traveling on foot, if the jour-
ney is over two hours; (3) those who are ill; (4) those over 70; (5) women who are
pregnant; (6) nursing mothers; (7) women in their menses; (8) those engaged in
heavy labor.

Foregoing earthly appetites helps one acquire godly attributes. There are bene-
fits for the Bahá’ı́ community as well, in that collective participation in the fast
deepens solidarity.

Special prayers have been revealed for the fast. Some are quite poetic and laden
with metaphors of devotion and transformation. One example is this excerpt from
a prayer by Bahá’u’lláh:

> I beseech Thee, O my God, by that Letter which, as soon as it proceeded out
> of the mouth of Thy will, hath caused the oceans to surge, and the winds to
> blow, and the fruits to be revealed, and the trees to spring forth, and all past
> traces to vanish, and all veils to be rent asunder, and them who are devoted
> to Thee to hasten unto the light of the countenance of their Lord, the Uncon-
> strained, to make known unto me what lay hid in the treasuries of Thy knowl-
> edge and concealed within the repositories of Thy wisdom. Thou seest me, O
> my God, holding to Thy Name, the Most Holy, the Most Luminous, the Most
> Mighty, the Most Great, the Most Exalted, the Most Glorious, and clinging to
> the hem of the robe to which have clung all in this world and in the world to
> come. (Bahá’ı́ Prayers, 242–43)

Fasting from food is a point of departure for spiritual development, where one
progresses, for example, to a state where one fasts from even the desire for food,

96    Bahá’u’lláh, Ascension of (May 29)

> or even the thought of food, and focuses instead on nearness to God, expressed
> through prayer and meditation, and service to others. The ultimate fasting is
> abstaining from passions of the self to become more compassionate toward others.
> The nineteen-day Bahá’ı́ Fast, therefore, is an ideal preparation for the Bahá’ı́
> New Year (Naw-Rúz, lit. “New Day”) that immediately follows the Fast, when
> the vernal equinox heralds a new springtime of personal and social renewal, both
physical and spiritual.

Bahá’u’lláh, Ascension of (May 29)

> The Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh (1817–1892), prophet-founder of the Bahá’ı́ Faith,
> is a solemn occasion commemorated by Bahá’ı́s worldwide at 3:00 a.m. on
> May 29 annually. It is one of the nine major Bahá’ı́ holy days, on which work is
> to be suspended. Shortly before dawn, Bahá’u’lláh passed away at 3:00 a.m. on
> May 29, 1892 in the Mansion of Bahjı́ (Arabic, “delight”), near ‘Akká in Palestine
> (now Israel). Local Bahá’ı́ communities worldwide therefore gather at that time
> (3:00 a.m.) to commemorate their founder with Bahá’ı́ prayers and scriptures, usu-
> ally culminating in the chanting in Arabic, or recitation in translation, of what is
> known as the “Tablet of Visitation,” a special prayer reserved for the commemora-
tion of Bahá’u’lláh, as well as the Báb.

A telegram bearing the news, “The Sun of Bahá’ has set,” was immediately dis-
> patched by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá (1844–1921), Bahá’u’lláh’s eldest son and successor), to
Sultán ‘Abdu’l-Hamı́d, with a request for permission to bury Bahá’u’lláh at Bahjı́,

˙            ˙
> which was granted. Bahá’u’lláh was interred shortly after sunset, on the very day
of his ascension.

Where the sacred remains of Bahá’u’lláh are interred is now known as the
Shrine of Bahá’u’lláh—a building that, in 2008, was designated a UNESCO World
