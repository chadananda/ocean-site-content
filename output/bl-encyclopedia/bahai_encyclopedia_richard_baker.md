Baker, Richard Edward St. Barbe
(1889–1982)
World-famous environmentalist, forester, and founder, in 1922, of Men of the
Trees, the first global conservation movement; author of some thirty books and
numerous articles; a committed Bahá’í who rendered service to the Bahá’í Faith
for more than fifty years.

                                                      rigorous theological debate, worked in his father’s
nursery, and practiced vegetarianism, as had some of his forebears. He traced his deep love of trees to
a transcendent experience: his first walk alone in the woods, at the age of five or six, which he likened
to a "woodland rebirth." 1

After completing his secondary education at Dean Close School,
a boarding school in Cheltenham, Baker set out on his "first real
adventure." According to his own account, since childhood he
had been captivated by stories about bears in letters written by
a great-uncle, Richard Baker, who had been a settler in Canada
a century earlier. Experiences during his teen years deepened
his attraction to Canada. With his family's consent, although
initially his decision had been a "blow" to them, he left for
Saskatchewan in 1909.2

While plowing the prairie and working as a lumberjack near
Prince Albert, he became concerned about the wasteful use of
timber resources and the destructive prairie farming practices
that created dust-bowl conditions through loss of topsoil. At this
point, he later recalled, his commitment to conservation began.
He attributed its quickening to the influence of the Cree, First
Nations people who lived with and felt a part of the forests.

With the intention of assisting in strengthening the Christian     Richard St. Barbe Baker. National Bahá’í Archives,

congregations of homestead settlers, Baker enrolled in
Emmanuel College, the divinity school at the newly established University of Saskatchewan in
Saskatoon, joining the university's second class in 1910–11. In 1913, after almost four years in Canada,
he returned to England and embarked on a divinity degree at Ridley Hall, Cambridge.

A year later, shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, Baker enlisted in King Edward’s Horse,
a cavalry regiment of the British Army. Later he was commissioned as an officer in the Royal Horse and
Field Artillery. He went to France in 1915, was severely wounded in battle three times, and was
decorated with the Military Cross. On one occasion he would have died had it not been for the alertness
of a member of the burial party, who noticed, when removing Baker’s ID tag, that the "corpse" was
bleeding. He was invalided out of military service in April 1918 and spent some months recovering from
his injuries before resuming his interrupted studies.

Having decided to pursue a diploma in forestry, in January 1919 Baker returned to Cambridge, this
time to Gonville and Caius College. His goal after receiving his degree in 1920 was to work in the field
of forest protection in the British colonies in Africa. Once again he followed trails blazed by a Baker
relative, in this case the famous explorer and naturalist Sir Samuel Baker, known for discovering the
source of the Nile in 1864.

KENYA AND THE MEN OF THE TREES
In November 1920 the Colonial Office appointed Baker Assistant Conservator of Forests in Kenya. In
this post he was responsible for identifying wood that might be sold on the British market to the
advantage of the colony and for assuring that future supplies of wood would be available. This
necessitated planting treated seeds and transplanting seedlings.

In Kenya Baker witnessed the environmental devastation that resulted from the traditional slash-and-
burn farming methods of the region, from overgrazing by goats, and from the colonial farmers'
introduction of crops and methods requiring enormous acreage. He developed a plan to restore the
native forest by planting food crops between rows of young trees. As several crops could be harvested
before the trees required transplanting, Baker hoped to demonstrate that crop growing was compatible
with managing forests. The project required thousands of seedlings. With few resources and little
departmental funding, he turned to the indigenous people for assistance.

In 1922 Baker held meetings with Kikuyu chiefs and elders to urge them to counter their destructive
farming methods by planting trees. Supported by Chief Josiah Njonjo and inspired by the ceremonial
dances that the local people used to mark all occasions, Baker devised a ceremonial tree-planting dance
to encourage the young village men to plant trees to replace the lost forests and to inaugurate his
crop-and-tree scheme. He called for volunteers to join together to become Watu wa Miti (Men of the
Trees).

Baker’s efforts reflected an uncommon attitude by a colonial officer toward the indigenous people:


       To be in a better position to help them I studied their language, their folklore and
       tribal customs, and was initiated into their secret society, an ancient institution which
       safeguarded the history of the past which was handed down by word of mouth
       through its members.

          Soon I came to understand and love these people and wanted to be of service to
       them. They called me "Bwana M‘Kubwa," meaning "Big Master," but I said, "I am
       your M‘tumwe" (slave). 3


Now an accepted practice termed social forestry, Baker’s approach caused the colonists to accuse him
of becoming too involved with the Africans. An event that provided further evidence of his concern for
the local people prevented him from rising high in the ranks of the Colonial Office. When a superior
officer tried to strike a native worker with the butt of his rifle, Baker, believing the action to be unjust,
intercepted the blow, taking it on his shoulder. This act, which the officer interpreted as gross
insubordination, was remembered long afterward by those who had routinely experienced colonial
discrimination.

Fifty Kikuyu warriors participated in the first dance of the trees on 22 July 1922. From this small
beginning, the Men of the Trees organization, which Baker formally founded in England in 1924, spread
to many other countries. Now known in many countries as the International Tree Foundation, it has a
large membership of women and men from all walks of life. In 1978 Charles, Prince of Wales, became
the society’s patron.

INTRODUCTION TO THE BAHÁ’Í FAITH
Baker left Kenya in 1924, returning for a brief time to England. In the autumn he read a paper on
Kikuyu beliefs at the conference "Some Living Religions within the British Empire" held in London from
22 September to 3 October 1924. At the end of his talk, Claudia S. Coles, an American living in London
who was one of a number of Bahá’ís attending the conference, approached him and told him about the
Bahá’í Faith. Ten days later, he sailed to Nigeria with a supply of Bahá’í books provided by Coles. He
studied them during the voyage and became a Bahá’í soon after. Coles and Baker remained close
friends until her death in 1931. She became, according to Baker, "one of the most active members of
the Council of the Men of the Trees, which shortly after this was started in London," and he credited
her as being "a great inspiration" in his life. 4

NIGERIA AND PALESTINE
From 1924 until 1929 Baker served as Assistant Conservator of Forests for the southern provinces of
Nigeria. In 1929 the High Commissioner of Palestine, Sir John Chancellor, asked Baker to apply the
lessons he had learned in Kenya to the Protectorate, which was suffering from the encroachment of the
desert. Chancellor believed that the problem could be tackled only by securing the agreement of the
different religions and interests in Palestine to take collective action. Having resigned from the forestry
service to devote full time to the Men of the Trees, Baker agreed to undertake the task. He approached
Shoghi Effendi, who enrolled as the first life member of the Men of the Trees, and, with the
encouragement of the retired soldier and administrator Field Marshall Viscount Allenby and the explorer
and geographer Sir Francis Younghusband, Baker then went on to enlist the support of the chancellor
of the Hebrew University, the grand mufti of the Supreme Muslim Council, the Latin patriarch of
Jerusalem, the bishop of Jerusalem, and others.

This initiative among the religious leaders of Palestine led to the creation of forty-two nurseries. Baker
also helped to establish Tu Bi’Shvat, the traditional Jewish New Year of the Trees, as a national tree-
planting day.

FURTHER INTERNATIONAL ACHIEVEMENTS
In the 1930s extensive lumber operations threatened the groves of ancient, enormous redwood trees in
California. Although small groves were to be retained, Baker believed that much larger groves were
required to sustain the climate necessary for preserving the species. He launched a "Save the
Redwoods" project, eventually attracting donations of more than ten million dollars. With these funds
the project bought a natural reserve of some 4,850 hectares (12,000 acres) of redwoods and handed it
over to the state of California to be preserved forever. In the 1960s Baker intervened again to save
redwoods being threatened by the construction of a new highway; he suggested an alternate route that
United States Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall agreed to adopt.

Baker's friendship with President Franklin D. Roosevelt contributed to his establishing the Civilian
Conservation Corps as part of the New Deal initiative. From 1933 to 1942 the CCC employed more than
three million people. The popular program was responsible for planting some three billion trees in all of
the states and several territories of the United States; it also worked on preventing soil erosion,
developing parks, and other conservation projects.

In 1945 Baker founded the World Forestry Charter Gatherings. These were annual luncheons at which
representatives of as many as sixty-two national governments and other influential persons were
apprised of the current situation of the world’s forests. For many years Baker opened the gathering by
reading a short official message from Shoghi Effendi. In the 1970s, with more formal international
meetings in place, the gatherings were discontinued for some time. On 15 December 1989 the Bahá’í
International Community, in collaboration with other organizations, reconvened the annual gathering to
mark the centenary of Baker’s birth. A second gathering, held on 28 July 1994 at St. James Palace in
London, followed up on forestry issues raised at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.

In 1952–53 Baker led the first Sahara University Expedition. Covering some 14,500 kilometers (9,000
miles) of desert from Algiers to Mount Kilimanjaro, this was an ecological survey designed to discover
the speed of the desert’s advance, to develop methods of stopping the encroachment, and to consider
the possibility of reclaiming the desert. Baker was convinced that the encroachment could be arrested
and reclamation undertaken if appropriate measures were adopted quickly. He recommended planting a
"Green Front" of trees 6,400 kilometers long (4,000 miles) and 48 kilometers (30 miles) wide along the
southern reaches of the Sahara. In Kenya he met again with Chief Ngongo and others who had been
present at the beginning of the Men of the Trees movement.

In 1959 Baker went to India, where he assisted Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in instituting a tree-
planting program to address the Indian desert problem and to raise the water table. He made similar
efforts in Pakistan, Australia, and other countries affected by encroaching deserts.

Baker returned to the Sahara in 1964, leading an expedition through more than forty thousand
kilometers (twenty-five thousand miles) of desert—by land, air, and water. His team visited twenty-four
countries and met with many heads of state to urge immediate action to halt the desert’s advance.
Recognizing that "The conquest of the desert will have to start with the conquest of the desert of the
heart of man," he saw Sahara reclamation as "one of the biggest tasks" humanity has ever faced: "Not
in my time, but some day, there may be farms on those wastes; orchards, gardens and great cities and
communities of men and women. Under the sands, nature has secreted its reserves; they must be freed
for the benefit of mankind. We have the knowledge; we must find the means."5 The challenge, in his
view, was "not to Africa alone but to the world"; he envisioned financing Sahara reclamation by
diverting "military and other personnel and... funds from the more than 120 billion dollars spent yearly
on armaments." 6 While his recommendations have not been enacted, in recent years governments and
international agencies have begun to address the question of the spreading deserts.

Baker’s international travels enabled him to lecture widely. His writings were equally extensive.
Throughout his career, he published articles (some written for Bahá’í publications) and books, often
including his own excellent photographs, on trees and forests, his work in various countries, and the
challenges of conservation. His writings were imbued with his sense of "inward kinship with the earth
and all living things."7 Some of his writings have been anthologized since his death.

NEW ZEALAND
Baker first visited New Zealand in 1931, and he returned a number of times over the following decades.
After one of these visits, he wrote a book, published in 1956, entitled Land of Tané.8 In 1957, following
a life-threatening illness, he went to New Zealand to recover, staying for a time at Mount Cook Station,
a large, high-country sheep farm near Aoraki/Mount Cook, New Zealand’s highest mountain, on the
South Island. In 1959 he officially transferred his residence to New Zealand when he married Catriona
Burnett, whose family owned Mount Cook Station. This was Baker’s second marriage, his first having
ended in divorce in 1953. He and Doreen Whitworth Long of Dorset, who had worked as his secretary in
the Men of the Trees organization, married in January 1946 and had two children: Angela, born in
1946, who followed her father to New Zealand and was the only member of his family to become a
Bahá’í, and Paul, born in 1949, who remained in England.

Some two hundred guests attended the 7 October 1959 Burnett-Baker wedding, and newspaper
accounts in the international press reported that the couple requested trees as wedding presents.9
Catriona's heavy responsibilities at Mount Cook Station hindered her from joining her husband in his
international travels, but she warmly welcomed visits by his friends and provided him with moral
support and a home that served in many ways as a sanctuary throughout the final twenty-three years
of his life.

In New Zealand Baker was instrumental in establishing tree shelterbelts in the farming and fruit-
growing area of Central Otago on the South Island, a feat that others had said was not possible. He
advised many of the country’s farming and forestry leaders on how best to halt the soil erosion that
had been caused by felling native trees and by overintensive stock grazing. His close association with
Sir Francis Dillon Bell and Sir Eruera Tirikatene, government ministers responsible for the Ministry of
Lands and Forests at different times, meant he was a major influence on the development of policies in
New Zealand that protected native forests and increased agricultural and farming productivity through
reforestation.

In 1962, at the age of seventy-three, Baker embarked on a five-month, nineteen-hundred-kilometer
journey (twelve hundred miles) on horseback from the northernmost kauri—a giant native tree whose
trunks he likened to the columns of "an ancient Greek temple"10 —at Cape Reinga on the North Island
to the southernmost kauri at the bottom of the South Island. As he made his way south, Baker visited
many schools, talking about the importance of trees to thousands of schoolchildren. The ride,
highlighting the United Nations’ Freedom from Hunger Campaign, received much media coverage.

BAHÁ’Í ACTIVITIES
Shoghi Effendi referred to Baker as "the first member of the English gentry to join the Bahá’í Faith."11
Over the next six decades, Baker remained a steadfast Bahá’í, rendering notable services and assisting
with the work of the Bahá’í Faith as his own professional commitments and travels permitted. In 1944,
for example, he was a member of the committee in the United Kingdom that organized the Bahá’í
Faith's first centenary, and during the early 1950s "he was a regular participant at every Bahá’í Summer
School" in the United Kingdom. 12 Following his 1952–53 Sahara expedition, Baker attended and spoke
at an international Bahá’í conference in Kampala, Uganda, 12–18 February 1953.

After Baker moved his home base to New Zealand in 1959, he gave many talks throughout the country
at meetings organized by local Bahá’ís. Whenever the opportunity arose, he was always willing to travel
from his somewhat isolated South Island home to promote the Bahá’í teachings.

In the 1970s Baker provided advice about tree planting on the site of the future Bahá’í House of
Worship in Iran, carrying with him on his flight to Tehran hundreds of young redwood trees from
California and staying for a time to supervise "the development a special nursery" for the trees.13 He
also advised on tree planting at various sites at the Bahá’í World Center in Israel.

THE MAN OF THE TREES
Baker was an inspirational figure whose blend of environmental awareness, spiritual activism, and
personal charisma made him unique. Well ahead of his time, he was responsible for planting billions of
trees and was fearless in his promotion of the need for humanity to respect nature and to be the
stewards of God’s earth. His good works can be seen in all continents.
"Richard St. Barbe Baker was a man for all seasons," Dr. Keith D. Suter, president of the United
Nations Association of Australia, wrote in tribute. "He was an internationalist. . . . he was able for well
over half a century to cross frontiers between nations which were often at political odds with one
another, such as the United States and Soviet Union. He looked upon the world as his garden." 14 "St
Barbe, as he was affectionately known to many, was," according to Richard Burleigh's assessment in
the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,


            a practical man of exceptional vitality, motivated by an unwavering belief in the need
            to reverse the destruction that had been wrought from the earliest times upon the
            forests of this planet. The combination of his ideals, backed by his religious
            convictions and blended with his agreeable personality, his ability to relate
            constructively to everyone he encountered, and his tireless energy, culminated in the
            vast contribution he made to pioneering the saving of the world's forests. He was
            always the first to declare that what had been achieved was the outcome of
            teamwork, but there can be no doubt that he was the indispensable catalyst. 15


Baker had audiences with many world leaders and dignitaries: members of royalty, government
officials, and religious leaders, including two popes. On such occasions he would often quote from the
Bahá’í writings in a subtle and dignified manner. In his lifetime Baker received a number of awards,
medals, and honors. On 6 November 1971 the University of Saskatchewan conferred on him the
honorary degree of Doctor of Laws. In 1978 Queen Elizabeth II appointed him an OBE (Officer of the
Order of the British Empire).

Baker died on 9 June 1982 during a visit to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, only a few days after planting,
on the grounds of his alma mater, his last tree. At the time of his death, he was working on yet
another book. Following a Bahá’í service, he was buried near two large spruce trees in Woodlawn
Cemetery, Saskatoon. The Universal House of Justice cabled on 10 June 1982: "PASSING DISTINGUISHED DEDICATED
SERVANT HUMANITY RICHARD ST BARBE BAKER LOSS TO ENTIRE WORLD AND TO BAHAI COMMUNITY AN OUTSTANDING SERVANT SPOKESMAN FAITH.   HIS   DEVOTION BELOVED

GUARDIAN   [SHOGHI   EFFENDI] NEVER CEASING EFFORTS BEST INTERESTS MANKIND MERITORIOUS EXAMPLE." 16



A celebration of Baker’s life and work was held at St. John’s Church, London, on 14 July 1982. A
conference inaugurating the Richard St. Barbe Baker Foundation took place at the University of
Saskatchewan on 4–5 June 1984, and in 1985 the foundation presented its first Man of the Trees
Award to Chinese forestry ecologist Zhu Zhaohua. On 28 March 2003 the Borough Council of his
birthplace, West End, Hampshire, unveiled a bronze bas-relief memorial in honor of the village's
illustrious son.
