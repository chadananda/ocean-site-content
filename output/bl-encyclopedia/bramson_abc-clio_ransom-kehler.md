Keith Ransom-Kehler

> Keith Ransom-Kehler, a wealthy member of the Baha'i faith in the United States, was the first woman to be
> named Hand of the Cause of God. She is considered the first Baha'i martyr from the United States.

> Keith Ransom-Kehler, born in 1876, grew up in Kentucky and Michigan. In 1898, she graduated from Vassar
> College and decided to pursue graduate studies. She attended several colleges, eventually earning a master's
> degree. She married her first husband in 1901. They had two children, but only one lived. Ransom-Kehler taught
> French and English literature at Albion College. Widowed, she moved to Chicago and married a second time in
> 1910. The family moved to New York City, and through her husband she entered the world of socialites. In 1911,
> Ransom-Kehler met Abdul-Baha in London, an event that was pivotal in her spiritual transformation.

> Trained as a Christian minister, Ransom-Kehler became a leader in the Chicago liberal Christian community and
> was active in social reform movements. She affiliated herself as a Baha'i in 1921. Again widowed in 1923, she
> was able to dedicate more time to her new religion and rapidly became a leading figure in the U.S. Baha'i
> community. She met the guardian, Shoghi Effendi, during her two pilgrimages to the Baha'i holy shrines in
> Palestine in 1926 and 1932. Her work to propagate and consolidate Baha'i communities greatly expanded in
> 1929. She traveled to the West Indies and visited almost all the Baha'i communities with Spiritual Assemblies in
> the United States. Following this, she left to pursue international missions, never returning to her homeland.

> Ransom-Kehler visited and spread the Baha'i message in Japan, China, New Zealand, Australia, and India. While
> she was in India, Shoghi Effendi called her to Haifa, Palestine, the Baha'i World Center, to propose a special
> mission to Iran. He personally prepared her for the arduous task of trying to convince the Iranian government to
> allow the Baha'is to publish and distribute Baha'i books in their country. Ransom-Kehler spent the last year of her
> life in an exhausting but futile series of meetings with government officials as she attempted to accomplish what
> turned out to be an impossible goal. At the same time, she traveled around Iran to meet with Baha'i communities,
> extend support from their Baha'i brothers and sisters in the United States, and help them propagate Baha'i
> teachings. Her efforts weakened her and in 1933 she succumbed to smallpox in Isfahan, where she is buried.
> The title "Hand of the Cause of God" was bestowed upon her shortly after her death. Shoghi Effendi, in a rare act,
> requested that a delegation of Persian Baha'is from different cities in Iran go on a pilgrimage to her gravesite on
> his behalf. The tomb constructed for her serves as a shrine. The year following her death, Shoghi Effendi again
> asked a delegation of Persian Baha'is to perform a pilgrimage to her shrine on his behalf.
