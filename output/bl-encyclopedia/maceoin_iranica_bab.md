**BĀB** “door, gate, entrance”: a term of varied application in Shiʿism and related movements. It is applied differently in several sects to a rank in the spiritual hierarchy, either as conceived in transcendent terms or as actually manifested in the religious system on earth. Thus, the Ismaʿili hierarchy of _ḥodūd al-dīn_ includes the _bāb_ as fourth in rank after prophet, _asās_, and _emām_ (Hollister, p. 260), while under the Fatimids _bāb_ came to be used as a title for the chief _ḥojja_, immediately under the imam and responsible for the organization of the _daʿwa_ (Lewis, “Bāb”). In the Noṣayrī system, the _bāb_ is the third element in the hierarchy after _maʿnā_ and _esm_, in which the _maʿnā_ is the equivalent of the Ismaʿili “silent” (_ṣāmet_) imam, the _esm_ the equivalent of the “speaking (_nāṭeq_) imam, and the _bāb_ the gateway to the imam. The names of the _abwāb_ are given for the first seven cycles and for the cycle of Islamic imams, beginning with Salmān al-Fāresī (with ʿAlī and Moḥammad). (For lists of these names, see Massignon, “Nuṣairī.”) In 245/859-60, Ebn Noṣayr proclaimed himself _bāb_ of the tenth Shiʿite imam, ʿAlī al-Naqī. The Druzes apply the term to the embodiment of the _ʿaql al-koll_ who stands as the first of the hierarchy of five agents below the divinity; thus, Ḥamza b. ʿAlī, their founder, claimed to be the _bāb_ as the last incarnation of universal reason (Carra de Vaux, “Druzes”).

Among the Twelver Shiʿites, the term is applied in a variety of ways to the imam, who is spoken of in traditions as _bāb Allāh_, _bāb al-hodā_, _bāb al-īmān_, and so forth, in which capacity he is the means of access to the knowledge of God and an intermediary for the passage of prayers and grace between the divine and human worlds (for numerous traditions on these themes together with Koranic verses interpreted accordingly, see Kermānī, _Mobīn_ I, pp. 227-31; for commentary on the application of the term _abwāb al-īmān_ to the imams in the _zīāra al-jāmeʿa al-kabīra_, see Aḥsāʾī, _Šarḥ_ I, pp. 78-85; for discussion of this theme in general, see Kermānī, _Eršād_ I, pp. 338-69; idem, _Feṭra_ II, pp. 198-213). ʿAlī is described in one tradition as the gate of the prophet, the latter being “the gate of God” (Kermānī, _Mobīn_ I, p. 228), while a well-known _ḥadīṯ_ (extant in several versions) ascribes to Moḥammad the words “I am the city of knowledge (_madīnat al-ʿelm_) and ʿAlī is the gate; will you enter the city other than by its gate?” (ibid., pp. 229-30). Shiʿite interpretation of Koran 2:58 and 7:161 identifies the imams with the _bāb_ through which the Children of Israel are to pass after saying “_ḥeṭṭa_” (for traditions, see Kermānī, _Mobīn_ I, p. 229; for commentary, see Aḥsāʾī, _Šarḥ_ II, pp. 227-31; Šabestarī, _Šarḥ_, pp. 148-49).
