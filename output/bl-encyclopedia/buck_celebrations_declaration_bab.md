The Festival of the Declaration of the Báb is one of five Bahá’ı́ festivals, and nine
Bahá’ı́ holy days on which work is to be suspended. This holy day commemorates
and celebrates the prophetic mission of the Báb, whose short-lived faith-
community, the Bábı́ religion, was succeeded by the Bahá’ı́ Faith, and whose doc-
trines—as well as several significant religious laws and observances—were taken
up in the Bahá’ı́ religion, effectively making the Báb “the martyr Prophet and co-
founder of their Faith” (Shoghi Effendi, Unfolding Destiny, 233) alongside its
principal founder, Bahá’u’lláh.

The Báb (1819–1850), whose given name was Sayyid ‘Alı́-Muh. ammad of
Shiraz, was the precursor and herald of Bahá’u’lláh (1817–1892), whose given
name was Mı́rzá H.usayn-‘Alı́ Núrı́. The Báb’s relation to Bahá’u’lláh is somewhat
analogous to John the Baptist’s role as the precursor and herald of Jesus Christ. By
“Declaration” is meant two things: (1) the Báb’s announcement of his prophetic
mission; and (2) the moment when the Báb’s first disciple, Akhúnd Mullá H.usayn
Bushrú’ı́ (1813–1849), recognized the Báb’s prophetic mission and became the
first believer. Thus, the Declaration of the Báb took place on the evening of
May 22, 1844. The signal moment was 2 hours and 11 minutes after sunset, as
the Báb himself states, in Persian Bayán 2:7 and 6:13, and also in the Kitáb-i Panj
Sha‘n (“Book of [the] Five Modes [of Revelation]”), revealed exactly six lunar
years later, on March 19, 1850.

The Declaration of the Báb is one of the “two Most Great Festivals” which, in
the words of Bahá’u’lláh, prophet-founder of the Bahá’ı́ Faith, is “that day on
which We [Bahá’u’lláh] raised up the One [the Báb] Who announced unto man-
kind the glad tidings of this Name [Bahá’u’lláh], through which the dead have
been resurrected and all who are in the heavens and on earth have been gathered
together” (Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-i-Aqdas, 59 [brackets added]). The Declaration of
the Báb actually falls on the Gregorian calendar date of May 22 in the evening
(i.e., 2 hours and 11 minutes after sunset), but since the Bahá’ı́ day begins at sunset
on what would normally be regarded in the West as the evening before May 23
(i.e., on the evening before the Muslim lunar date of Friday, the fifth day of Jamá-
dı́yu’l-Avval AH 1260 or May 23, 1844). Thus, the Declaration of the Báb is for-
mally listed as May 23, even though it is observed on the evening of May 22.
The other “Most Great Festival” is the 12-day “Festival of Ridván” (April 21–

˙
May 2). What the two “Most Great Festivals” have in common is that they com-
memorate the prophetic declarations of the “Twin Founders” of the Bahá’ı́ Faith,

the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh. Of the two festivals, the Festival of Ridván (“Paradise”) is

˙
> preeminent (i.e., the “King of Festivals”), since the Báb not only declared his own
> prophetic mission, but heralded the imminent advent of a messianic figure referred
> to as “Him Whom God shall make manifest,” whose subsequent appearance, as
Bahá’u’lláh, the majority of the Báb’s followers (known as “Bábı́s”) later accepted.

Historically, the Declaration of the Báb is to be understood within the context of
> 19th-century Persia (now Iran). Messianic fervor had been ignited across
> Persia over the expected return of the Twelfth Imam, who was said to have disap-
> peared in the Islamic year of 260 AH and who had gone into occultation for a period
> of 1,000 lunar years. Thus, in the Islamic year 1260 AH (1844), Persia was charged
> with what scholars call “eschatological tension.” The Báb declared that his appear-
> ance signaled the return of the Twelfth Imam. In each succeeding year of his short
> mission, the Báb advanced progressively greater prophetic claims. During the last
> three years of his ministry and prior to his martyrdom on July 9, 1850, the Báb
> declared that his real station was not only that of the (return of) the Twelfth Imam,
> but also a new Prophet and “Manifestation of God,” empowered to abrogate the
laws of Islam and to reveal a new set of divine laws in their stead.

Although several accounts present different versions of the event, the one that is
> the most widely accepted is, briefly, as follows: In Persia, two influential theologians,
> Shaykh Ah.mad Ah.sá’ı́ (d. 1826) and his successor, Sayyid Káz.im Rashtı́, proclaimed
> the imminent return of the Imam Mahdı́. (“Mahdı́” is a religious term identical to the
> “Qá’im” in Shi‘i Islamic eschatology.) Before Sayyid Káz. im died in 1843, he
> instructed his disciples to scatter in search of the promised Mahdı́, who would soon
> be revealed. One of the more impressive young Shaykhı́s, Mullá H.usayn, had trav-
> eled to the Persian city of Shı́ráz and was mysteriously drawn to a young merchant,
> Sayyid ‘Alı́-Muh.ammad of Shiraz, who invited Mullá H.usayn to his home that night,
> May 22, 1844. Of that momentous experience, Mullá H.usayn recounts:

> When I first started upon my quest, I determined to regard the two following
> standards as those whereby I could ascertain the truth of whosoever might
> claim to be the promised Qá’im. The first was a treatise which I had myself
> composed, bearing upon the abstruse and hidden teachings propounded by
> Shaykh Ahmad and Sayyid Kázim. Whoever seemed to me capable of unrav-
> elling the mysterious allusions made in that treatise, to him I would next sub-
> mit my second request, and would ask him to reveal, without the least
> hesitation or reflection, a commentary on the Súrih of Joseph, in a style and
language entirely different from the prevailing standards of the time. . . .

I was revolving these things in my mind, when my distinguished Host
> again remarked: “Observe attentively. Might not the Person intended by
> Sayyid Kázim be none other than I?” I thereupon felt impelled to present to
> Him a copy of the treatise which I had with me. “Will you,” I asked Him,
> “read this book of mine and look at its pages with indulgent eyes? I pray
you to overlook my weaknesses and failings.” He graciously complied with

> my wish. He opened the book, glanced at certain passages, closed it, and
> began to address me. Within a few minutes He had, with characteristic vig-
> our and charm, unravelled all its mysteries and resolved all its problems.
> Having to my entire satisfaction accomplished, within so short a time, the
> task I had expected Him to perform, He further expounded to me certain
> truths which could be found neither in the reported sayings of the imáms
> of the Faith nor in the writings of Shaykh Ahmad and Sayyid Kázim. These
> truths, which I had never heard before, seemed to be endowed with refresh-
ing vividness and power. . . .

He then proceeded to say: “Now is the time to reveal the commentary on
> the Súrih of Joseph.” He took up His pen and with incredible rapidity
> revealed the entire Súrih of Mulk, the first chapter of His commentary on
> the Súrih of Joseph. The overpowering effect of the manner in which He
> wrote was heightened by the gentle intonation of His voice which accompa-
> nied His writing. Not for one moment did He interrupt the flow of the verses
> which streamed from His pen. Not once did He pause till the Súrih of Mulk
> was finished. I sat enraptured by the magic of His voice and the sweeping
> force of His revelation. At last I reluctantly arose from my seat and begged
> leave to depart. He smilingly bade me be seated, and said: “If you leave in
> such a state, whoever sees you will assuredly say: ‘This poor youth has lost
> his mind.’” At that moment the clock registered two hours and eleven
minutes after sunset. . . .

“This night,” He declared, “this very hour will, in the days to come, be cel-
> ebrated as one of the greatest and most significant of all festivals.” (Nabı́l,
> The Dawn-Breakers, 57–61)

The preceding eyewitness account by Mullá H.usayn narrates the event of the
Báb’s Declaration, but not its substance. What did the Báb announce? What did
the Báb proclaim? The Báb called upon the kings and rulers of the earth to recog-
nize the truth of his prophetic mission and to follow his religion. The Súrah of
Mulk (“Chapter on Sovereignty”) states, in part:

> O concourse of kings and of the sons of kings! Lay aside, one and all, your
dominion which belongeth unto God.

O King of Islam! Aid thou, with the truth, . . . Him Who is Our Most Great
> Remembrance . . . and . . . subdue, with the truth and by His leave, the coun-
> tries, for in this world thou hast been mercifully invested with sovereignty,
> and wilt, in the next, dwell, nigh unto the Seat of Holiness, with the inmates
> of the Paradise of His good-pleasure. (The Báb, Selections from the Writings
of the Báb, 41–42)

“Verily, the essence of religion is none other than submission unto This
> Remembrance [the Báb]. Thus whoso seeketh Islam (submission to God),
> let him submit unto this Remembrance [the Báb]. For God will inscribe his

> name in the Book of the Righteous as a true Muslim, and he will be praised
> as one who is faithful. Whoso rejecteth this true Islam, God shall not accept,
on the Day of Resurrection, any of his deeds. . . .

We verily have moved the mountains upon the earth, and the stars upon
> the Throne, by the power of the one true God, around the Fire which burneth
> in the centre of Water, as ordained by this Remembrance. (Provisional trans-
> lation by Saiedi, Gate of the Heart, 142 and 68 [brackets added])

The Báb claimed to fulfill the long-awaited return of the Twelfth Imam—who
> Shi‘i Muslims identified as the “Mahdı́” expected by Sunni Muslims. This messi-
> anic figure, also known as the Qá’im (“Ariser”/“Resurrector”) would appear at the
> end of the time, thereby marking the end of the Islamic dispensation. The Báb, at
> first, attracted a handful of disciples whose religion, in turn, rapidly attracted
> numerous followers across Persia, although the Bábı́ religion itself was quite
> short-lived. The Bábı́ movement thus emerged in the middle of the 19th century
> as the latest and most dramatic example of chiliastic/millenarian aspirations in
> modern Islam. The Báb’s claim of divine authority, and its ideological underpin-
> nings, naturally challenged the finality of the Islam and hence aroused the
opposition of the religious establishment.

The Báb had a cyclical view of history. Religions are divine in origin, yet, like
> spring and winter, seasonably have their rise and decline. Divinely revealed religions
> are, in their pure form, quintessentially harmonious and one in essence. In their
> heyday, religions are each suited to the needs of society in their particular day and
> age. When, in the course of social evolution, a religion becomes obsolete, it must
> be renewed and replaced by a new expression of divine Reality. Islam had run its
> course, and a new religion was on the horizon, with the Báb as the new messenger
> of God. These ideas, along with the Báb’s metaphorical interpretation of the Islamic
Resurrection (Qı́yámat), presaged the Bahá’ı́ doctrine of “progressive revelation.”

Although, at first, the Báb’s claims and doctrines were couched in pious Islamic
> language, what the Báb went on to do was quite revolutionary. The Báb, according
> to Armin Eschraghi, established a new, post-Islamic faith that fulfilled all the cri-
> teria of an independent religion: a new founder, newly revealed scriptures, a new
> set of metaphysical and theological teachings distinct from those of Islam, and
> new religious laws and principles. In revealing his new code of laws as the
> Persian Bayán (1848), the Báb pursued three major goals: (1) paving the way for
> the advent of the Promised One; (2) provoking the clerical establishment and
> shattering the foundations of their often-abused institutionalized authority; and
(3) proving the independence of his own religion as distinct from Islam.

The Bábı́ movement spread like wildfire across Persia during the period from
> 1845 to 1847. The Báb was imprisoned and, in the summer of 1848, a farcical trial
> took place that, by all accounts, was intended to humiliate the Báb. The Báb was
> bastinadoed and his imprisonment prolonged. Shi‘i clerics stirred up popular senti-
ment against the Bábı́s, who were attacked across Persia by various mobs. The

Bábı́s grouped to defend themselves in the fortress-shrine of Shaykh Tabarsı́, and
in Zanján and Nayrı́z. Clerics finally issued a death warrant, and the Báb was
executed by a firing squad of 750 musketeers on July 9, 1850, in Tabrı́z, Persia.

After an ill-fated attempt on the life of the Sháh of Persia on August 15, 1852, by
two aggrieved Bábı́ youths, the Sháh ordered the most brutal tortures and deaths of
Bábı́s (and, subsequently, Bahá’ı́s), with estimates ranging from around 5,000 to
20,000 martyrs, who, as Browne described it, were subjected to “[t]errible . . . modes
of inflicting death. . . . Of the unfortunate Bábı́s, some were hewn in pieces, some
were sawn asunder, some were flayed with whips, some were blown from the mouths
of mortars” (Browne, “Bábı́ism,” in Religious Systems of the World, 348).

The Declaration of the Báb inaugurated a process whereby a clear break from
Islam was publicly taking place in Persian society, posing an immediate threat to
the authority of the religious establishment, thereby unleashing the fury of the
clerics and the rage of the state, plunging the Bábı́ (and, later the Bahá’ı́) commu-
nity into a cauldron of unrelenting torture and horrific death. This period of intense
persecution and martyrdom steeled the resolve of the faithful believers and was
noised far and wide, such that the religion, far from being extirpated, attracted
broadcast interest and spread far beyond the borders of Persia to emerge—in its
final form as the Bahá’ı́ Faith—as the second-most widespread religion in
the world today in terms of global diffusion (in all countries except North Korea
and the Vatican, surpassed only by Christianity).

Bahá’u’lláh has revealed several Tablets commemorating the Declaration of the
Báb. One of the most well known is the “Tablet of the Eternal Youth” (Lawh-i
Ghulámu’l Khuld), which is composed partly in Arabic—in rhythmic, rhymed
prose, with short verses alternating with refrains—and partly in Persian. Revealed
during the Baghdad period of Bahá’u’lláh’s ministry (1853–1863), this Tablet
explicitly commemorates the Declaration of the Báb. According to Walbridge’s
description, the gates of Paradise open wide to reveal a Youth of Paradise, who
symbolizes the Báb. Standing before the gaze of the concourse of heaven, all are
dazzled by the beauty of this Youth. The gates of Paradise then open a second
time, wherein a luminous Maiden of Heaven appears, who is the personification
of the spirit of Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation. The denizens of heaven are awed by her
beauty, by her song and by the lock of hair that slips from beneath her veil. She
then stands before the Youth and lifts the veil from his face, whereupon the pillars
of God’s throne quake and tremble, and all creatures are struck dead. A celestial
voice proclaims that the eyes of the ancients had longed to behold this Youth.
The Youth then raises his eyes. With one word, he revives the spirits of the heav-
enly host. And by a single glance, the Youth restores the people of the earth—
and then returns to Paradise. The Tablet closes in allegorical Persian, proclaiming
to the peoples of the earth that the true morning of spiritual renewal has dawned,
that the fire on Sinai is aflame once again, and that the celestial wine is flowing,
for all to quaff. Ecstatic in tone, this Tablet appeals to all peoples to heed the call
of the Báb, and hints of Bahá’u’lláh’s own prophetic station as well. (Bahá’u’lláh

> had not yet publicly declared that he was the Promised One foretold by the Báb.)
> The “Tablet of the Youth of Paradise” is melodically chanted at commemorations
> of the Declaration of the Báb and at other joyous occasions as well (Walbridge,
Sacred Acts, Sacred Space, Sacred Time, 161–63).

The Declaration of the Báb, as previously mentioned, is observed in the evening
> of May 22, typically with readings and prayers as befit the occasion. Where
> Persian- and Arabic-speaking believers are gathered, the “Tablet of the Eternal
> Youth” (or another Bahá’ı́ scripture revealed for this occasion) will be chanted.
In a great many, if not most Bahá’ı́ gatherings, Mullá H usayn’s account, as

˙
> recorded in Nabı́l’s narrative, translated as The Dawn-Breakers, will be read, not
> as sacred scripture, but as sacred history. Prayers and readings are usually followed
> by refreshments and fellowship, and the rest of the holy day is observed as a day of
rest from work during the day of May 23.

The two “Most Great Festivals” of the Bahá’ı́ Faith are commemorations of the
> prophetic declarations of the “Twin Founders” of the Bahá’ı́ Faith, the Báb and
> Bahá’u’lláh. Concomitant with the growth and development of the Bahá’ı́ commu-
> nity worldwide, the Declaration of the Báb will likely emerge, in time, as one of
the great religious festivals of the world’s religions.

Báb, Martyrdom of the (July 9)

The yearly commemoration of the Martyrdom of the Báb is one of the nine major
Bahá’ı́ holy days on which work is suspended. Observed by Bahá’ı́s in the Middle
East on 28 Sha‘bán—in accordance with the Islamic lunar calendar—the occasion
is annually observed on July 9 throughout the rest of the Bahá’ı́ world. For many
participants, it is a deeply moving experience.
Sayyid ‘Alı́-Muhammad of Shiraz (1819–1850)—known by his spiritual title as
“the Báb” (“the Gate”) and regarded as the precursor and herald of Mı́rzá H.usayn-
‘Alı́ Núrı́, known as Bahá’u’lláh (the “Splendor” or “Glory of God,” 1817–1892)—
was martyred on July 9, 1850, in Tabrı́z, Persia (now Iran). The circumstances of
the Báb’s martyrdom, and its subsequent commemoration as a Bahá’ı́ holy day, will
be discussed below.

The Báb founded the 19th-century movement generally known as Bábism, an
independent (albeit short-lived) religion that clearly broke from its parent religion,
Persian (i.e., Twelver Shi‘i) Islam. As Orientalist Edward G. Browne observed
regarding the Bábı́ phenomenon, “whatever its actual destiny may be, is of that
stuff whereof world-religions are made.” As Browne predicted, the Bábı́ religion
emerged as a “new world-religion” through its eventual transformation into what
is now known as the Bahá’ı́ Faith.

While the Bábı́ and Bahá’ı́ religions are distinct, they are intimately related both
historically and doctrinally. The writings of the Báb, for instance, are considered
sacred scripture by all Bahá’ı́s. A number of the Báb’s religious laws were adopted
and adapted by Bahá’u’lláh, as was the Badı́‘ calendar (a solar calendar of
