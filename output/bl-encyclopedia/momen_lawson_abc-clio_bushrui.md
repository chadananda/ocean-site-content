Mulla Husayn BushruI

> Mulla Husayn Bushrui was the first to believe in the Bab and a member of the "Letters of the Living," the first and
> highest-ranking group of the Bab's disciples. As such, he helped to establish the Babi movement, an offshoot of
> Islam and forerunner of the Bahai faith.

> Mulla Husayn was born in 1813 in a village near the small town of Bushruiyyih in northeastern Iran. His father
> was a dyer and his mother a poet. During the course of his education in the cities of Mashhad and Isfahan, he
> became a follower of the Shaykhi teaching, and in 1835, he set off for Karbala in order to attend the lectures of
> the Shaykhi leader Sayyid Kazim Rashti. The latter regarded Mulla Husayn highly and chose him when he
> needed someone to go to Iran and canvass support from some of the senior clerics there for the Shaykhi
> teachings, which were at this time under attack.

> Mulla Husayn returned successfully from his mission in January 1844 only to find that Sayyid Kazim had died
> shortly before. Mulla Husayn refused all efforts to install him as the new leader of the Shaykhis, and instead set
> off in search of a new leader, as Sayyid Kazim had suggested. This led him to Shiraz and a meeting with the Bab
> on May 23, 1844, at which the latter put forward a claim that Mulla Husayn accepted (an event commemorated
> annually by Bahais as a holy day). Mulla Husayn thus became the first of the Letters of the Living and was sent
> off to proclaim the teachings of the Bab. His subsequent journeys and activities brought Bahaullah and many
> others into the Babi fold. After meeting the Bab again in Shiraz in 1845, he returned to Mashhad, where he set up
> a center for the propagation of the Bab's teaching. In spring 1848, he made a journey to Maku on foot (1,200

miles) to see the Bab, who was imprisoned there.

> In July 1848, he raised a Black Standard in Mashhad (a sign of the appearance of the mahdi [messiah] in Islamic
> prophecy) and set off eastward with some 200 Babis. They were surrounded at Shaykh Tabarsi in October 1848
> and besieged by royal troops. Although most of the Babis had regarded Mulla Husayn as the foremost of the
> disciples of the Bab up to this time, Mulla Husayn deferred to Quddus, another of the Bab's disciples, during this
> siege. Mulla Husayn was shot during a battle on February 2, 1849, and died later that same day. He was 35. The
> Bab wrote a eulogy for him to be used when visiting his grave, and Bahaullah also praised him highly in his
> writings. His story as told in the early Bahai history Nabil's Narrative presents a picture of courage, humility, and
> intellectual brilliance that has made him a spiritual hero for successive generations of young Bahais.
