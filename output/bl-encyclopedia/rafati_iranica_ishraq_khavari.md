**EŠRĀQ ḴĀVARĪ, ʿABD-AL-ḤAMĪD** (b. Mašhad 1320/1902, d. Tehran 15 Mordād 1351 Š./6 August 1972) Bahai scholar, teacher, and author. He received a traditional Islamic clerical education and studied literature, the religious sciences, and philosophy under Adīb Nīšāpūrī, a well-known poet and man of letters. He studied in Qom and Isfahan before settling in Malāyer, where he became a preacher and school teacher. His conversion to the Bahai faith in 1345/1927 cost him his teaching job and forced him to leave Malāyer. He spent the rest of his life as an itinerant Bahai teacher, living in Hamadān, Ḵūzestān, Khorasan, Isfahan, and Tehran, and visited many countries in the Middle East and South and East Asia. He played an important role in the development of Bahai religious education in Persia.

Ešrāq wrote many books on the Bahai faith. While traditional and uncritical in their methodology, they contain many texts and large amounts of information and remain basic research tools in Bahai studies. His best known work is _Qāmūs-e īqān_ (4 vols., Tehran, 127-28 B. (Badīʿ era)/1970-71), a commentary on B ahāʾ-Allāh’s _Ketāb-e īqān_ arranged in the form of a glossary of proper names and difficult words and phrases. He wrote several other commentaries in the same form: _Raḥīq-e maḵtūm_ (2 vols., Tehran, 103 B./1946), _Asrār-e rabbānī_ (2 vols., 118 B./1961), and the unpublished _Dāʾerat al-maʿāref_. Also noteworthy are several compilations of Bahai scripture: _Ayyām-e tesʿa_ (Tehran, 103 B./1946), on Bahai holy days; _Māʾeda-ye āsmānī_ (9 vols., Tehran, 128 B./1971), on theological topics; and _Ganjīna-ye ḥodūd wa aḥkām_ (Tehran, 128 B./1971), on Bahai law. Other significant works include _Moháāżarāt_ (2 vols., Tehran, 121 B./1964), a collection of lectures; _Nūrayn-e nayyerayn_ (Tehran, 123 B./1966), a biography of the martyred Nahrī brothers of Isfahan; and _Ganj-e šāyagān_ (Tehran, 124 B./1967), a description of Bahāʾ-Allāh’s major works. He wrote many other works of polemics, history, prophecy interpretation, and fiction, and translated from Arabic and English. Ešrāq’s papers and unpublished works are kept in the Bahai World Center Archives. _Bibliography_: N. Ḏokāʾī Bayżāʾī, _Taḏkera-ye šoʿarā-ye qarn-e awwal-e Bahāʾī_, Tehran, 121 B./1964, I, pp. 55-68.
