**About the book:** _Religious Celebrations,_ ed. J. Gordon Melton, with James A. Beverley, Christopher Buck, and Constance A. Jones, covers more than 800 celebratory occasions from all of the world's major religious communities as well as many of the minor faith traditions. The two-volume encyclopedia provides a complete reference tool for examining the myriad ways people celebrate their religious lives across religious boundaries, providing information on numerous celebratory activities. Offering the most comprehensive coverage of religious holidays ever assembled, this book covers festivals, commemorations, holidays, and annual religious gatherings all over the world. Entries written by specialists on different religious communities capture the unique intensity of each event, be it fasting or feasting, frenzied activity or the universal cessation of work, a huge gathering of the faithful en masse or a small family-centered event. The work spotlights celebrations that currently exist without overlooking now-abandoned celebrations that still impact the modern world.

mild compared to other similar groups. Much of the criticism grew from its advo-
cacy of celibacy for its more committed full-time members.

The Bahá’ı́ calendar charts physical time, as do all calendrical systems, yet is addi-
tionally designed to inspire spiritual progress by associating time with the cultiva-
tion of human nobility. The precise name for the Bahá’ı́ calendar is the Badı́‘
(“Unique” or “Wondrous”) calendar. It originated with Sayyid ‘Alı́-Muhammad

˙
of Shiraz (1819–1850), entitled the Báb (“the Gate”), who founded the Bábı́ reli-
gion, soon superseded by the Bahá’ı́ Faith, established by Mı́rzá Husayn-‘Alı́ Núrı́

˙
(1817–1892), known as Bahá’u’lláh (a spiritual title meaning the “Splendor [or
“Glory”] of God”). By adopting and modifying the Badı́‘ calendar for use by the
Bahá’ı́ community, Bahá’u’lláh gave it formal sanction.

Time is invested with spiritual significance by the naming of weekdays, days of
the month, months, years, and cycles of years after godly perfections that can be
translated into goodly virtues, such as “Beauty” (Jamál) “Knowledge” (‘Ilm),
“Honor” (Sharaf), and “Grandeur” (‘Az amat), which are names of 4 of the 19

˙
Bahá’ı́ months. These dynamic “names of God” each highlight a distinctive quality
of sterling character and human nobility, in a process of transformation that may,
to coin the present author’s term, be called theophoric metamorphosis. Literally,
the term “theophoric,” as its Greek root indicates, means “God-bearing.” Here,
the “names” of God may be conceived of as “qualities” or, better still, as “powers”
of God that can be potentially manifested by man (and, to a lesser degree, by each
created thing when it reaches its potential state of perfection).

In the Báb’s Kitáb al-Asmá’ (“Book of [Divine] Names”), which exceeds 3,000

pages and is said to be “the largest revealed book in sacred history,” the Báb treats
human beings as reflections of divine names and attributes (Saiedi, Gate of the
Heart, 36). To the extent that a person is a “bearer” of one of the “names” (i.e.,
qualities or powers) of God, that individual is empowered to express that quality
in human action. Through the progressive spiritualization of all persons—and,
indeed, of all things—the Báb wished to transform all of reality into “mirrors”
reflecting the perfections represented by these divine names.

Like other religious calendars, special holy days (such as the “Birth of the Báb”
> on October 20 and the “Birth of Bahá’u’lláh” on November 12) commemorate sig-
> nificant events in the history of the Bahá’ı́ religion. These twin functions of medi-
> tation and commemoration combine to produce a means of reckoning and
> consecrating time in what is offered as a world calendar for future society, should
all countries wish to adopt it.

The Báb established the Badı́‘ calendar in several passages, particularly in the
> Persian Bayán 5:3, a volume he “revealed” (i.e., authored by divine revelation)
> around 1847, in which he stated:

> The Lord of the universe hath fashioned all types of years by His behest, and
> hath ordained that . . . each year should equal the numerical value of the words
> “all things” (kullu shay’) [19 × 19 = 361], to consist of nineteen months, where
> each month equalleth nineteen days, that from the moment of the rising of
> the sun in the vernal equinox—corresponding to the first sign of the Zodiac,
> the sign of Aries—till the end of its voyage at the end of winter—correspond-
> ing to the last sign of the Zodiac, the sign of Pisces—all beings may traverse
through all the nineteen stages of the Letters of Unity.

The first month . . . resembleth the sun, while all other months resemble
> mirrors which reflect the radiant lights of that supreme month, in such wise
> that naught is seen in them but that month. God hath called that month the
> month of Bahá (Splendour, Glory), meaning that therein lieth the splendour
> and glory of all months, and He hath singled it out for Him Whom God shall
> make manifest. (Provisional translation by Saiedi, Gate of the Heart, 327–28)

Here, “all things” (kullu shay’) “signifies the new spiritual community which
> comes into being out of the unity of the Báb and His Letters of the Living [first
18 disciples]” (Saiedi, Gate of the Heart, 283).

Because the Báb’s style of discourse tends to be philosophically rarified and thus
> difficult to understand without the benefit of some explanation, a brief comment on
> the significance of the first month of the Badı́‘ calendar will elucidate the position
and preeminence of the name, “Bahá’.” The Báb singled out the word váhid (unity)

˙
> as a symbol for the oneness of God. In Arabic reckoning (abjad), the numerical value
of “váhid” (Arabic: wāhid) is 19. Thus, the number 19 is a Bábı́ and Bahá’ı́ symbol

˙                 ˙
> for the unity of God. Using the number 19 as the basis of the Badı́‘ calendar, the
> Báb drew the names of the 19 months from the Du‘á al-Sahar, an Arabic invocatory
prayer attributed to Imam Mhuammad al-Báqir (d. 732 CE), the fifth of the Twelver
Shi‘i Imams, recited at dawn by Shı́‘ı́ Muslims during the Fast of Ramadan. Both
the sixth Shi‘i Imam, Ja‘far al-Sádiq (d. 765 CE) and the eighth Shi‘i Imam, Ridá’

˙                                                  ˙
> (d. 818 CE), who transmitted this prayer, are said to have claimed that this dawn
prayer contained the “Greatest Name” of God (al-ism al-a‘zam).
Bahá’u’lláh, in the Persian “Tablet of the Greatest Name,” cites the beginning
of this dawn prayer, and observes that Muslims, despite the fact that certain Imams

indicated that the prayer contains the “Greatest Name” of God, remained oblivious
to the positional preeminence of the word “Bahá’,” and thereby failed to divine
this open secret. Instead of recognizing that Bahá’u’lláh was presaged in this
prayer, several Shi‘i clerics pronounced a death sentence on Bahá’u’lláh (which
was never implemented).

The Báb specifically dedicates Naw-Rúz to “Him Whom God shall make mani-
fest” (the promised messianic figure foretold by the Báb) and that, by naming the first
day of each month of the Badı́‘ calendar, “Bahá’,” and by naming the first month of
each Badı́‘ year, “Bahá’” (dedicated to “Him Whom God shall make manifest”),
the Báb seems to imply that “Bahá’ ” (or Bahá’u’lláh) is this Promised One.

While the Báb’s theophoric naming conventions and system of aggregating
years (i.e., tracking the spiritual names of weekdays, days of the month, months,
and years within cycles of 19 and 361 years) remain intact in the Bahá’ı́ Faith,
the current practice is generally to simply number the years consecutively as the
“Bahá’ı́ Era” (“B.E.”) progresses. In Gregorian terms, the Bahá’ı́ Era began on
March 21, 1844. The Bahá’ı́ epochal year of 1844 marks the year that the Báb
founded the Bábı́ religion. Thus, 2010 is part of two consecutive Bahá’ı́ years, in
which the year 166 B.E. ended on March 20, 2010, and the new year, 167 B.E.,
commenced on March 21, 2010 (or, technically, on March 20, 2010, after sunset,
since each new Bahá’ı́ day begins after sunset).

The Badı́‘ calendar is symmetrically composed of 19 months of 19 days, con-
templatively named after divine attributes, with four (or, in a leap year, five) inter-
calary days, after the 18th month (in Bahá’u’lláh’s revision of the calendar) to
round out the solar year. This calendrical symmetry is extended: not only are there
19 days per month and 19 months per year, but 19 years per cycle, and 19 cycles
per major cycle, while conserving the traditional seven-day week (signaling a will-
ingness to accommodate the calendrical needs of the older religions in a reli-
giously plural society), where Friday is evidently designated as a day of rest,
although this is not yet officially practiced in the Bahá’ı́ religion.

The Bahá’ı́ calendar is solar and, in terms of its yearly renewal, seasonal. The
Bahá’ı́ New Year is synchronized with the first day of spring (i.e., the vernal equi-
nox) and, not surprisingly, is called “Naw-Rúz,” a Persian expression that literally
means “New Day.” The day of Naw-Rúz is the first of nine Bahá’ı́ holy days in
which work is to be suspended.

Naw-Rúz is astronomically fixed. Bahá’u’lláh directed that this feast day be
celebrated on whichever day the sun passes into the constellation of Aries, even
if this occurs one minute before sunset. Due to the “equinox wobble” of 3.2 days,
astronomically, Naw-Rúz could fall on March 19, 20, 21, or 22, depending on
the time of the equinox. It is anticipated that the timing of Naw-Rúz will require
the choice of a fixed location on earth, which will serve as the standard for the pre-
cise determination of the spring equinox. As with a number of other issues affect-
ing the Bahá’ı́ calendar, this matter will be resolved in due course by the Universal
House of Justice, the elected international Bahá’ı́ governing council. For now, the

> Bahá’ı́ New Year is celebrated on March 21 in the Occident, whereas in the Orient,
> including Iran and the Bahá’ı́ World Centre in Haifa/‘Akká, the day of Naw-Rúz is
determined on the basis of the true astronomical vernal equinox.

Besides its special designation as the “New Day,” March 21, 2010, for instance,
> in the ennobling naming conventions of the Badı́‘ calendar, may be “read” in the
> following manner: This is the weekday of “Beauty” (Jamál, i.e., Sunday), the
> (first) day “Splendor” (Bahá’) in the (first) month of “Splendor” (Bahá’; names
> of days and months follow the same progression) in the (15th) year of “Affection”
(Vidád), in the cycle (Váh id) of the first Grand Cycle (Arabic: Kullu Shay’,
Persian: Kull-i-Shay’).

Arranged in historical order, the nine Bahá’ı́ holy days recapitulate the origins
> and history of the Bahá’ı́ religion. With the exception of Naw-Rúz (which meta-
> phorically represents springtime renewal, both in its physical and its metaphysical
> sense), the Bahá’ı́ Holy Days are annual commemorations of significant mile-
> stones in the formative era of Bábı́ and Bahá’ı́ history:

> 1. Birth of Bahá’u’lláh (November 12, 1817).
> 2. Birth of the Báb (October 20, 1819).
> 3. Naw-Rúz (March 21, 1844).
> 4. Declaration of the Báb (May 23, 1844).
> 5. Martyrdom of the Báb (July 9, 1850).
6. First Day of Ridván (April 21, 1863).
7. Ninth Day of Ridván (April 29, 1863).
8. Twelfth Day of Ridván (May 2, 1863).
9. Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh (May 29, 1892).

Taken together, the Birth of the Báb and the Birth of Bahá’u’lláh are referred to
> as the “Twin Holy Birthdays” since, in the Hegira (Muslim) lunar calendar, these
> fall on consecutive days: The birth of the Báb was on the first day of the month
of Muharram 1235 AH (October 20, 1819), while the prior birth of Bahá’u’lláh
fell on the second day of Muharram 1233 AH (November 12, 1817). Whether
> the Twin Holy Birthdays are to be celebrated on a solar or lunar basis will later
> be determined by the Universal House of Justice. For now, they are observed on
a solar basis in most Bahá’ı́ communities worldwide.

There is a religiously “seasonal” aspect as well, since the Bahá’ı́ calendar sets
> apart 19 days, from March 2 to 20, for fasting from sunrise to sunset. The Badı́‘
> calendar further regulates the rhythm of Bahá’ı́ community life in establishing
> the dates for the Nineteen-Day Feast, in which each local Bahá’ı́ community gath-
> ers for the purpose of worship, consultation, and fellowship. Given its spiritual,
> administrative, and social functions, the Bahá’ı́ “Nineteen-Day Feast” is the heart
of Bahá’ı́ communal worship and community building in each Bahá’ı́ locality.

Each Bahá’ı́ “Feast” (from the Latin festus, or “joyous”; the Arabic term is dı́yáfat,
which derives from a root word for “hospitality”) typically takes place on the first
day of the Bahá’ı́ month. Here, the theophoric calendrical names take on their
greatest significance, as reflected in the names of the 19 Bahá’ı́ feasts, which are
named after the Bahá’ı́ months in which they respectively fall. These are:

These “names of God” may not only be invoked, but they may be evoked.

According to Bahá’u’lláh, these “names” of God may be reflected as human per-
fections (to the degree humanly possible), like a polished mirror:

> Having created the world and all that liveth and moveth therein, He, through the
> direct operation of His unconstrained and sovereign Will, chose to confer upon
> man the unique distinction and capacity to know Him and to love Him—a
> capacity that must needs be regarded as the generating impulse and the primary
> purpose underlying the whole of creation. . . . Upon the reality of man, . . . He
> hath focused the radiance of all of His names and attributes, and made it a mir-
> ror of His own Self. Alone of all created things man hath been singled out for so
> great a favor, so enduring a bounty. (Bahá’u’lláh, Gleanings from the Writings
> of Bahá’u’lláh, 65)

Reflecting divine attributes, however, requires divine assistance, for not until
“the dross is blotted out from the face of the mirror it can never represent the
image of the sun nor reflect its light and glory” (Ibid., 66) This divine assistance
is brought by the wisdom and inspiration of the “Manifestations of God” (Prophets
or Messengers of God), as Bahá’u’lláh further explains:

> Led by the light of unfailing guidance, and invested with supreme sover-
> eignty, They [Manifestations of God] are commissioned to use the inspira-
> tion of Their words, the effusions of Their infallible grace and the
> sanctifying breeze of Their Revelation for the cleansing of every longing
> heart and receptive spirit from the dross and dust of earthly cares and limita-
> tions. Then, and only then, will the Trust of God, latent in the reality of man,
> emerge, as resplendent as the rising Orb of Divine Revelation, from behind
> the veil of concealment, and implant the ensign of its revealed glory upon
> the summits of men’s hearts. (Ibid., 67)

The mere fact that the name of a given Bahá’ı́ month is a godly quality that can
> be acquired as a human virtue does not, alone, accomplish that result. No burst of
> insight will emanate from the simple recitation of, say, “Grandeur.” Meditating on
> a virtue and then manifesting it is part and parcel of Bahá’ı́ self-transformation. In
> many Bahá’ı́ feasts, the devotional prayers and readings are often focused on the
> name of the Bahá’ı́ month as a “theme,” although there is certainly no requirement
to do so.

Take, for example, the attribute of “Generosity,” which is the name of one of the
> years. (Jád; idiosyncratic construction of the Arabic jūd), for instance, which
appears as the eighth year in the cycle of 19 years, called a “Unity” (Váhid). In
> the Persian Hidden Words (no. 49), Bahá’u’lláh states that giving to the poor is a
> human expression of divine generosity:

> O CHILDREN OF DUST! Tell the rich of the midnight sighing of the poor,
> lest heedlessness lead them into the path of destruction, and deprive them
> of the Tree of Wealth. To give and to be generous are attributes of Mine; well
> is it with him that adorneth himself with My virtues. (Bahá’u’lláh, The
> Hidden Words of Bahá’u’lláh, 39)

While not directly related to the calendar, the idea that the divine names have a
transformative potential can be seen in this passage from the Persian Bayán 5:4:

> For the divine Cycle advanceth in stages, until such Revelation when all
> things will be called by the names of God, such that no name will be assigned
> to anything unless it resembleth one of the names of God, glorified and
> exalted is He. . . . This will occur gradually and in stages, until all heaven,
> earth, and that which lieth between them, will be filled with the names of
> God. . . . Well is it with the people of that age who call nothing but by a name
> of God. That age is worthy to be praised as the beginning of the worlds of
> paradise! (Provisional translation by Saiedi, Gate of the Heart, 334)

Bahá’u’lláh explains that God is sanctified above all attributes and “names.”
> Therefore, any and all references to the “names of God” apply to the “Manifesta-
tions of God” (i.e., Messengers of God, or Prophets), as Bahá’u’lláh states in

the Gems of Divine Mysteries: “Thus hath He revealed these most excellent
names and most exalted words in the Manifestations of His Self and the Mirrors
of His Being. It is therefore established that all names and attributes return
unto these sublime and sanctified Luminaries” (Bahá’u’lláh, Gems of Divine
Mysteries, 35).

These “stages” of transformation, of which the Báb speaks, involve a process
that may be termed theophoric metamorphosis (previously defined at the begin-
ning of this article). Beyond the contemplative life, so classically modeled by
monks and mendicants in cloistered isolation, the various names of God must be
effectively “translated” from the realm of ideals into the arena of social action in
order for a transformation to take place. (In fact, Bahá’u’lláh prohibited monasti-
cism in this day and age.) As a result, the individual is transformed to the degree
that society is transformed as a result of that act, and vice versa. This may be illus-
trated as follows:

By contemplating and “translating” the name “Light” (the name of the fifth
Bahá’ı́ month) into a personal virtue for the social commonweal, an individual
may conceive of a way to enlighten others. By meditating on the name, “Knowl-
edge” (the name of the 12th Bahá’ı́ month) and then manifesting that attribute in
action, a person may impart insight or information to others, which will benefit
them. In the same vein, by reflecting deeply, then acting on the divine name,
“Mercy” (the name of the sixth Bahá’ı́ month), one may elect to perform a singular
deed of “mercy” or kindness by ministering to the sick, poor, or otherwise disad-
vantaged members of society. Here, a godly “name” is effectively expressed as a
goodly action. The Bahá’ı́ calendar not only charts the march of time, but
addresses the quality of time by synergistically inspiring the progress of soul and
society.

There are certain “mystical”—that is, symbolic—aspects to the Badı́‘/Bahá’ı́
calendar as well, but these more recondite features of the calendar are beyond
the scope of this article. Suffice it to say that the Bahá’ı́ calendar, by charting
physical time and associating time with divine perfections translatable as human
virtues, not only quantitatively measures a given point in time, but qualitatively
measures the progress of the soul in relation to the social moment. Thus, the theo-
phoric (“God bearing”) nature of the calendar, in theory, becomes theomorphic
(“God manifesting”) in practice, whereby the Bahá’ı́ calendar may prospectively
live up to its name, Badı́‘ (“Wondrous”).

g   Bahá’ı́ Faith

> The Bahá’ı́ Faith arose from the Bábı́ Faith, a religion that briefly flourished in Iran
> in the 1840s. It was established by ‘Alı́-Muhammad of Shiraz (1819–1850), who in

> Bábı́ leaders at which he gave each a title; he took on the title of Bahá’u’lláh (the
> glory of God), one subsequently endorsed by the Báb. Before his execution, the
> Báb recognized Bahá’u’lláh’s teenage half-brother Yahyá (1831–1912) as a figure-
> head leader of the Bábı́ community, though he gave Yahyá no explicit authority.
