individuals were adherents of the Shaykhí school
of Shia Islam—based on the teachings of Shaykh Ahmad Ahsá’í (1753–1826) and Siyyid Kázim Rashtí
(d. 31 December 1843/1 January 1844)—and had been seeking spiritual direction after Siyyid Kázim
died without appointing a successor. A number of them had undertaken a spiritual retreat before
journeying from Karbala in Iraq to Shiraz. There the leader of the group, Mullá Husayn Bushrú’í,
encountered Siyyid ‘Alí-Muhammad and, in the course of one evening, became the first to recognize
Him as the Báb. After an interval of forty days, the other disciples found themselves drawn to Him.
Each of the eighteen recognized Him independently, gave Him allegiance, and agreed not to reveal His
identity until the appointed time. The Báb gave each of these first disciples the title "Letter of the
Living."

No full, contemporaneous list of the Letters of the Living exists.
According to the historian Nabíl (1831–92), 1 they were:

The Báb often refers to the Letters of the Living in His writings.

Husayn and a group of Bábís were besieged in 1848–
49\. Bahá'í Photographic Library         One may find their names mentioned, at times indirectly, in such

works as the Persian Bayán and the Arabic Bayán (His two
major works) and the Seven Proofs. He composed many texts for them in the form of prayers or
responses to questions and wrote "tablets of visitation" (prayers recited at a shrine or grave site) in
their honor, especially for those who died at Shaykh Tabarsí.

SIGNIFICANCE
The term "Letters of the Living" is both a title and a theological statement. The expression comprises
two Arabic words: hurúf (singular: harf), meaning "letters," and hayy, meaning "the living." The
combination hurúf-i-hayy is new; it does not occur in the Islamic scriptures. In His early writings, the
Báb also referred to His first disciples by the word sábiqún or sábiqín (the forerunners), which stems
from Islamic Traditions and texts.

The term "letter" is symbolic, as is the Báb’s use of the term Nuqtih (Point) to refer to the
Manifestation or Messenger of God, who is the embodiment of the Primal Will (a concept similar to the
Logos or "Word" in Christianity). According to the Báb, God created the Primal Will through the
causation of the Primal Will itself and then created all things through the causation of the Primal Will; in
other words, the Creator of the cosmos and spiritual civilization is the Manifestation of God. The term
"Point" indicates that everything originates with the Manifestation, even as each letter and word
originates with the mark made as the pen first touches paper. 7 The Báb is known as "the Point of the
Bayán" (referring to the title of the Báb’s two major books as well as, in general terms, all of the Báb’s
writings), just as the Báb calls the Prophet Muhammad "the Point of the Qur’án." 8 The title "Point" may
be interpreted as an indication of the two stations of the Manifestation, divine and worldly, just as the
geometric point, which has no specific dimension, mediates between the physical and the nonphysical
worlds.

From the point, the mark that is made as the pen touches paper, emanate the letters of the alphabet,
which are the primary and basic units of written language. The whole body of knowledge is based on
these units. The letters are all different, but they have a common root in the point, the first mark made
by the pen; no matter how numerous, they have one background, one common source. The letter is the
intermediary between the point, which is the genesis of all letters, and words and sentences, which are
composed of letters. Thus the term "letters" (hurúf), when attributed to the first to believe in a
Manifestation, acknowledges these souls as letters coming forth from the Point, just as the form of
every letter begins with a point made on a page.

When applied to the Báb’s first disciples, the appellation "letter" may be seen to emphasize their role in
inaugurating a divinely revealed religion. Likewise, the term "letter" suggests the use of familiar,
universal symbols combined to revive the body of knowledge through the renewal of the vocabulary—
that is, the same unchanged letters form entirely original words. The "letters" may be seen as a

symbolic expression of both a new scripture and a new civilization.

The Báb also uses the term "letter" with a broader meaning, applying it to all believers, not just to His
first disciples: "Whoso acteth in conformity with that which is revealed therein [the Bayán] will abide in
Paradise, under the shadow of His affirmation and reckoned among the most sublime Letters in the
presence of God."9

The Islamic and Bábí scriptures use the word hayy (the living)
as one of the names of God. Islamic theology refers to God’s
attributes by two categories of names: the attributes of the
essence of God and the attributes of God’s actions. Hayy is one
of the seven names used for the attributes of God’s essence,
which are inseparable from one another. In His writings the Báb
sometimes uses a combination of six particular attributes of God
—one of which is Hayy. These are the Incomparable (Fard), the
Ever-Living (Hayy), the Self-Subsisting (Qayyúm), the All-Wise
(Hakím), the Just (‘Adl), and the Holy (Quddús). Taken
together, these names have nineteen Arabic letters, thus
representing the Primal Unity (see discussion of numerical
symbolism and of the term váhid, meaning "unity," below).

The Báb uses the word hayy within the context of the term
hurúf-i-hayy to convey multiple meanings. Since Hayy is one of
the attributes of God, its use in the term "Letters of the Living"
suggests that these disciples manifest attributes that reflect the      The Báb's letter to Quddús, the last Letter of the

Living, in the Báb's own handwriting. Bahá'í
divine; and "the living" within this phrase refers as well to those Photographic Library
who are given life (that is, the life of the spirit of faith) and the
ability to transfer this spirit of life to others. The term also connotes the life given by God on the Day
of Resurrection (which, the Báb teaches, is the coming of a new Messenger of God), when all will rise
from the dead (that is, will be given a new spiritual life rather than a physical resurrection). By calling
His first disciples "the Letters of the Living," the Báb affirms that the Day of Resurrection has come to
pass, that the dead have risen, and that these eighteen disciples are the first to arise. The Báb also
refers to the Qur’anic description of God as Hayyu’l-Qayyúm (the Ever-Living, the Self-Subsistent) and
to His (the Báb’s) identity as Qayyúm (the first sacred text He revealed is called the Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’),
with Hayy being realized through the eighteen souls who first recognized Him. In another Qur’anic
reference, to the fact that all things live by water, the Báb indicates that the Letters of the Living bring
all believers to life and that all are created by the Divine Water—which is the Revelation of God and of
the verses of sacred scripture.

The word hayy has numerical symbolism as well. In the time of the Báb, the ancient abjad system, in
which every letter of the Arabic alphabet has a numerical value, was widely used. According to this
system, each word has both a literal meaning and a numerical value. The word hayy equals the number
eighteen, corresponding to the number of the Báb’s first believers.

The Bayán proclaims that the Letters of the Living constitute the "return" of eighteen figures:
Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam; His son-in-law Ali; His daughter Fatima; eleven of their descendants
who were the Imams from the Holy Family; and four others—the four angels responsible for creation,
sustenance, death, and existence, or the four vicegerents who were intermediaries for the Hidden
Imam. 10 Thus there is a correspondence between the number of the key figures in Shia Islam, the
number of the first believers in the Báb, and the numerical value of the word hayy.

The eighteen Letters of the Living, along with the Báb Himself, comprise the first váhid of the Bábí
religion. The word váhid, which means "unity," refers in the first instance to the unity of God. The

numerical value of the word váhid, according to the abjad system of calculation, is 19. This number
also applies to the invocation Bismi’lláhi’r-Rahmáni’-Rahím (In the Name of God, the Compassionate,
the Merciful), which opens the chapters of the Qur’an, and Bismi’lláhi’l-Amna’i’l-Aqdas (In the Name of
God, the Most Exalted, the Most Holy), with which many of the Báb’s writings begin. Each of these
invocations has nineteen letters in the Arabic alphabet. Thus the system of sacred order in the Báb’s
religion is expressed by the number 19 and, after that, 361 (19 x 19), which corresponds numerically
with the theological term kull-i-shay’("all things"—i.e., the entire creation in every aspect of existence,
or the cosmos). 11 The writings of the Báb indicate and commemorate the unparalleled greatness of the
first váhid, the Letters of the Living, in that the days of the month of Bahá—the first month of the
Báb’s calendar (later to become the Bahá’í calendar)—refer to them.

> The number nineteen is symbolic of creation; one of the
> names of the Báb is Nuqtiy-i-Úlá, "the Primal Point,"
> indicating that everything—first, the Letters of the Living,
> and then all other parts of "all things"—originates from
> Him. In line with the symbolism of sacred script,
> including letters and points, as discussed above, the
> point under the Arabic letter b, or ba (), the first letter in
> each of the two invocations cited, relates to the famous
> Tradition attributed to Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of
> Muhammad and the first Imam of the Shia: "All of the
> knowledge of all the holy books is in the Qur’an, and all
> of the knowledge of the Qur’an is in the Fátiha [the first
> sura], and all of the knowledge of the Fátiha is in the
> Basmala [i.e., the invocation Bismi’lláhi’r-Rahmáni’-
> Rahím], and all of the knowledge of the Basmala is in
> the letter ba, and all of the knowledge in the ba is in the
> point [nuqtih] under the ba, and I am that point."12 The
> Báb is the letter b itself. All knowledge is in the nineteen
> letters of the Basmala and derives from the Báb as a
> Manifestation of God in the station of the Primal Point.
> The term "point" also refers to the Tradition that

> multiplied.

Symbolically, the Bábí system of order may be viewed as
A view of the fortress of Mákú in Azerbaijan, where the Báb was an expression of the sacred relationship linking each
imprisoned for nine months in 1847–48 and where He              member of the community to the first váhid and beyond
commenced composition of the Persian Bayán. Bahá’í
Photographic Library                                            that to the Point, the Manifestation of God, who is

simultaneously and mysteriously part of the first váhid
and yet transcends it. Although the Báb did not define exactly how His community was to be organized
at the social level, He stated that every member of a váhid functions as a generating point for another
váhid. 13 This order does not necessarily lead, however, to the assignment of rank. Any pure soul among
the rank and file of believers may be spiritually close to the Manifestation.

The Bayán explains that the Letters of the Living are the signs of God’s living Manifestation (hayy-i-lam
yazal).14 The Manifestation is the mirror of God, and the Letters of the Living are mirrors of the
Kingdom of the Manifestation, reflecting only His reflection. 15 They are the return of the Holy Family of
Islam 16 —the return of essences and attributes, not a physical resurrection or reincarnation.17 They are
the inhabitants of Paradise.18 The Letters of the Living are the same entity in all the religions of the
past and the future and a symbolic expression of the unity of the religion of God in all of its aspects.19
The Letters of the Living are the intermediaries through whom the Sun of Truth (the Manifestation of

God) is recognized, 20 and they are always under the shadow of His grace and glory. 21 They have no
authority except through Him.22 Whoever takes refuge under their shadow is saved, until the advent of
"Him Whom God Shall Make Manifest" (the promised Manifestation). The Letters of the Living are like
mirrors: as long as they reflect the Sun of Truth, they are the source of spiritual influence; but if they
turn away from Him, they lose that power.23

Although the Báb extols the Letters of the Living in the same terms in which the imams of Shia Islam
are extolled and includes them within the structure of His covenant with His followers, He also
specifically denies them the binding authority that would have been necessary had He intended them to
function as His successors. Instead, the layers of covenantal authority that existed in Islam are realized
in the Báb’s own Manifestation, indicating that He intended no real succession during the period
between His death and the revelation of the Promised One.24

The Báb gave the Letters of the Living no authority to interpret, no office to rule, and no ongoing
function among their coreligionists. Theirs was not a political designation but a spiritual one. They were
respected for their precedence (sabq) in recognizing the Báb, but the Bayán makes it clear that their
station is entirely spiritual and symbolic.25 They were not elected but chosen. They recognized the
Manifestation of God by seeking the truth and were accorded distinction because they came to know
the Báb through independent spiritual experiences and visions. Several of these first disciples, singled
out by the Báb and given a particularly high station, exercised charismatic authority among their fellow
Bábís. However, this authority flowed mainly from their personal qualities and accomplishments rather
than from their station as Letters of the Living.
