Bahāʾīs [Supplement 2016]
(3,940 words)

Bahāʾīs are the followers of the Bahāʾī religion (known as the “Bahāʾī Faith,”
its o cial name), an independent world religion with Bābī origins within an
Islamic matrix and milieu. The Bahāʾī Faith — phenomenologically a
doctrinal and social enlargement of the Bābī religion by way of sui generis
sacred texts characterised by a more pronounced cosmopolitanism and
egalitarianism — was founded by Mīrzā Ḥusayn-ʿAlī Nūrī (1817–92), known
as Bahāʾullāh (“Glory of God”; the standard Bahāʾī spelling, Bahā’u’llāh, will
be employed throughout this article), in Baghdad in 1863. In 1866 it emerged
as a distinct faith-community in Edirne (modern Turkey). Bausani states that
“Bahāʾī doctrines … present a clear though simple theology and a precise
legislative organization that is totally di ferent from that of Islam,” and that
Bahāʾism is “an autonomous and speci c religion, no longer bound to Islam
… truly the fourth monotheistic religion (together with Judaism, Christianity,
and Islam) … [and] the rst monotheistic religion to originate in Persia, if
one excludes the partial Zoroastrian monotheism” (Bausani, Religion in Iran,
396). Despite having a modest seven million adherents, the Bahāʾī religion is
now established in every country in the world today except North Korea and
Vatican City.

While Bahāʾīs do not identify as Muslims, they have a profound respect for
the Qurʾān as a divine revelation, despite having their own corpus of sacred
scriptures quite separate from it. Bahāʾīs also believe in Muḥammad as the
“seal of the prophets and of the messengers” (thus going beyond the Qurʾān’s
honori c of Muḥammad as just the “seal of the prophets” [khātam al-
nabiyyin], Q 33:40) and hold him to be the nal messenger for the “cycle of
prophecy” (kawr-i nubuvvat).

Prophecy foretells, as well as tells forth. In Bahāʾī doctrine, the “cycle of
prophecy” or “cycle of Adam” (kawr-i ādam) prepared the world for the “cycle
of ful lment” (kawr-i taḥaqquq va ikmāl) or the “Bahāʾī cycle” (kawr-i Bahāʾī),
symbolically foreshadowed in the Qurʾān as the “great announcement” (al-
nabāʾ al-ʿaẓīm, Q 78:2; Bahā’u’llāh, Kitāb al-aqdas, paragraph 167). This “cycle
of ful lment” was inaugurated by the Bāb (“Gate”), who prophesied the
imminent advent of “him whom God shall manifest” (man yuẓhiruhu llāh),
whom the majority of Bābīs (followers of the Bāb) came to view as
Bahā’u’llāh.

A Bahāʾī theology of pluralism, with special reference to Islam, may be based
on a statement by Shoghi E fendi, designated as the “Guardian” of the Bahāʾī
Faith in the years 1921–57: “Unequivocally and without the least reservation it
proclaims all established religions to be divine in origin, identical in their
aims, complementary in their functions, continuous in their purpose,
indispensable in their value to mankind” (E fendi, World order, 58). This, of
course, applies as much to Islam as to other religions.

As it arose out of an Islamic historical context and milieu the Bahāʾī religion
has certain Islamicate elements, yet it exhibits certain other features that,
phenomenologically, are supra-Islamicate and socially and institutionally
distinctive in character. For instance, Islamic doctrine adheres to a belief in
successive revelations, beginning with Adam and culminating with
Muḥammad as the “seal of the prophets.” In Bahāʾī teachings, the idea of
successive revelations is invested with a teleology that transforms it into

progressive revelation, where the succession of messengers throughout the
history of religions is not only sequential but also cumulative, coe cient
with the social evolution of humanity. As humanity advances socially so does
the corresponding need for guidance and laws suited to the exigencies of the
day and age. Here, “progressive” conveys the notion of a “fuller” and “more
advanced” repository of divine guidance (by way of revelatory sacred texts)
while making no claim of intrinsic superiority.

The Bahāʾī Faith underwent transformations in ethos and organisation in
three phases: Islamic context (1844–92); international missions (1892–1963);
and global di fusion (1963–present). The Islamic context was co-extensive
with the combined ministries of Bahā’u’llāh and his precursor, Sayyid ʿAlī-
Muḥammad Shīrāzī (1819–50), known as the Bāb, the prophet-martyr of the
Bābī movement.

The year 1260/1844 marked the Shīʿī millennium, a thousand lunar years
since the alleged occultation of the twelfth Imām (see imām; Shīʿism and the
Qurʾān). On the evening of 22 May 1844 the Bāb e fected a decisive,
eschatological break from Islam by composing aloud before a guest, Mullā
Ḥusayn Bushrūʾī (1813–49), the rst sūra(Sūrat al-mulk) of an exegetical work
entitled “Sustainer of the names (of God)” (Qayyūm al-asmāʾ, hereafter, “QA”),
often referred to as the “Commentary on the sūra of Joseph,” an audacious
and revolutionary commentary on the twelfth sūra of the Qurʾān (see
Joseph). In this work he “proclaimed himself the focus of an Islamic
apocalypse” (Lawson, Structure, 8).

The Bāb’s earliest works display a conscious e fort to extend and amplify a
Qurʾānic voice, a crucial warrant of revelation. Perhaps the most remarkable
feature of the Qayyūm al-asmāʾ is its claim to be the “new Qurʾān” and the
“true Qurʾān” (Lawson, Gnostic Apocalypse and Islam, 22). To illustrate this
audacious claim, several examplars may be cited: “I swear by your Lord, this
Book is verily the same Qurʾān (lit. al-furqān) which was sent down in the
past.” (QA 81, verse 31, trans. Taherzadeh, Selections from the writings of the

Bāb, p. 67). Ioannesyan (Prophetic mission, 14) points to QA 99, where the
Bāb speaks of two furqān’s (referring to the Qur’an and Qayyūm al-asmāʾ).
Ioannesyan (Prophetic mission, 19) also cites QA 41, where the Bāb states that
the Qayyūm al-asmāʾ was sent down as the mystery of the Qurʾān anew, with
a new truth, in a new way. Con rming this, Mohammad-Hosseini (The
commentary on the sūra of Joseph, 8) explains that in QA 3 the Bāb
“mentions three times that the Qurʾān has been revealed to his heart.” Similar
claims are made in QA 7 and 26. More generally, Saiedi states that “the
Qayyūm al-asmāʾ is also frequently called the ‘Qurʾān’ or the ‘Inner Qurʾān’”
(Saiedi,Gate of the heart, 140). In the rst chapter of QA, the Bāb makes the
eschatological declaration that his religion is henceforth the “true Islam” to
which all should turn: “Thus whoso seeketh Islam (i.e. submission to God),
let him submit unto this Remembrance. … Whoso rejecteth this true Islam,
God shall not accept, on the Day of Resurrection, any of his deeds” (trans.
Saiedi, Gate of the heart, 142).

In 1850, the Bāb, thirty years old and a prisoner at this time, was transferred
from Chihrīq to Tabriz. By order of Grand Vizier Amīr Kabīr — and by death
warrant signed by a number of Muslim clerics — the Bāb was executed by

ring squad on July 9, 1850, an event his followers, then and now, regard as
martyrdom (Amanat, Resurrection, pp. 394–405).

After a four-month imprisonment in Tehran, exonerated of all charges of
conspiracy in the assassination attempt, Bahā’u’llāh, a prominent follower of
the Bāb, was exiled to Baghdad, where he arrived on April 8, 1853. This period
(1853–63) was eschatologically charged with his own messianic secrecy
(ayyām-i buṭūn). In his pre-eminent doctrinal work “The book of certitude”
(Kitāb-i īqān, hereafter Īqān) Bahā’u’llāh advanced an extended Qurʾānic and
biblical argument to authenticate the Bāb’s prophetic credentials. This book-
length text was, according to the colophon, “revealed” in a period of 48 hours.
It was the late Bahāʾī scholar Ahang Rabbani who discovered that the Īqān
was written in January 1861 (Rabbani, Conversion, 34–5). Bahā’u’llāh’s

repertoire of exegetical techniques includes most of the twelve “procedural
devices” attested in the classical commentaries (Wansbrough, qs), as well as
various others.

Bahā’u’llāh’s style of discourse is exegetical in nature, with frequent pairings,
linked by the Persian metaphorical genitive (iḍāfa-yi majāzī), of Qurʾānic
symbols and referents. Hermeneutically, the Īqān resonates with ve Islamic
orientations towards symbolism: 1. the semanticism of rhetoric, especially
the science of tropes (ʿilm al-bayān); 2. the dialectic of theology (kalām); 3.
reason (ʿaql) and analogy (qiyās) as a re ex of philosophy ( falsafa) and
jurisprudence ( qh); 4. the use of allusion (ishāra) and gnosis (maʿrifa
qalbīya) in Ṣūfī/Ishrāqī mysticism (see Ṣū sm and the Qurʾān); and 5.
recourse to apocalyptic presentism, adducing prophetic proof-texts to
instantiate a realised eschatology, a common characteristic of millenarian
sectarianism.

In his “Commentary on the sūra ‘By the sun’” (Tafsīr sūrat wa-l-shams),
despite being critical of rhetoric (ʿilm al-balāgha) and the cognate Qurʾānic
sciences, Bahā’u’llāh echoes al-Ghazālī (d. 505/1111) and al-Taftazānī (d.
791/1389) in stressing the need to harmonise literal and gurative
interpretations (Buck, Symbol, 91–2, 104). Citing Q 3:5, in his “Tablet on
esoteric interpretation” (Lawḥ-i taʾwīl) Bahā’u’llāh states that eschatological
verses should be understood through esoteric interpretation (taʾwīl) whereas
Qurʾānic laws are to be understood by their obvious (ẓāhir) sense (tafsīr; see
exegesis of the Qurʾān: classical and medieval).

The Islamic idea of prophethood is anchored in Q 33:40, which is widely
believed to con rm Muḥammad as the nal prophet (see Prophets and
prophethood). In what is perhaps his most signi cant exegetical move,
Bahā’u’llāh relativises that claim in order to supersede it, refocusing the
reader’s attention a mere four verses later (Q 33:44) on the eschatological
attainment of the presence of God (liqāʾ Allāh) on the Last Day (see
eschatology):

Even as the Lord of being hath in His unerring Book (Qurʾān), after (baʿd az)
speaking of the “Seal” in His exalted utterance: “Muḥammad is the Apostle of
God and the Seal of the Prophets” (Q 33:40), hath revealed unto all people
the promise (vaʾda) of “attainment unto the divine Presence (liqāʾyi khudā).”
To this attainment to the presence of the immortal King testify the verses of
the Book, some of which We have already mentioned (cf. par. 148: Q 29:23,
2:46, 2:249, 18:111, 13:2). The one true God is My witness! Nothing more exalted
or more explicit than “attainment unto the divine Presence” hath been
revealed in the Qurʾān (va khudā-yi vāḥid shāhid-i maqāl ast kih hīch amrī
aʾẓam az liqāʾ va asraḥ az an dar furqān zikr nayāftih). Well is it with him that
hath attained thereunto, in the day wherein most of the people, even as ye
witness, have turned away therefrom.

And yet, through the mystery of the former (avval) verse, they have turned
away from the grace promised by the latter (thānī), despite the fact that
“attainment unto the divine Presence” in the “Day of Resurrection” (liqāʾ dar
yawm-i qiyām) is explicitly stated in the Book (Qurʾān). (Bahā’u’llāh, Īqān,
trans. E fendi, par. 181–2, with parenthetical references added; Bahā’u’llāh,
Īqān, par. 181–2).

In this pivotal passage, although Bahā’u’llāh refers back to “verses of the
Book, some of which We have already mentioned,” a quick search of the Īqān
shows that, in par. 148, Bahā’u’llāh cites Q 29:23, 2:46, 2:249, 18:111, and 13:2. Yet
in this passage Bahā’u’llāh also alludes to a Qurʾānic announcement of the
“attainment unto the divine presence” on the “day of resurrection” (liqāʾ dar
yawm-i qiyām) that comes “after” (baʿd az) the “seal” verse.

Shoghi E fendi, in his dual role as authorised translator and interpreter of
Bahāʾī scriptures, provides a word-for-word, literal translation in rendering
the Persian as: “And yet, through the mystery of the former.” He then inserts
one word, “verse,” for ampli cation, which is not in the original Persian. This
subtle yet highly signi cant gloss disambiguates the text, narrowing the
reading from an episodic sequence of prophetic/eschatological events (“seal

of the prophets” followed by “divine presence”) to a textual, Qurʾānic
sequence, i.e. of a pair of verses descriptive of this same sequence. This
makes perfect sense since the preposition “after” (baʿd az) can also mean
“next.”

In a widely cited reading, Buck (Symbol, pp. 191–200; Beyond, pp. 375–78)
proposed that Bahā’u’llāh intended this pair of verses, Q 33:40 and Q 33:44, to
be read together. Indeed, the very next verse after the “seal” verse that refers
to the eschatological encounter with God is Q 33:44, which reads: “Their
greeting the Day they meet Him will be, ‘Peace.’ And He has prepared for
them a noble reward” (Sahih International). A Shīʿī rendering is: “On the day
when they will be brought into the presence of their Lord, their greeting to
each other will be, ‘Peace be with you.’ God has prepared an honorable
reward them” (Muḥammad Sarwar).

Here, cognates of liqāʾ and yawm are found in Q 33:44. The Arabic word for
“they will meet Him” is yalqawnahu (third person masculine plural imperfect
verb, related to liqāʾ) and that for “day” is yawma (accusative masculine
noun). These terms correspond — conceptually as well as linguistically — to
Bahā’u’llāh’s reference to “‘attainment unto the divine Presence’ on the ‘Day
of Resurrection’” (liqāʾ dar yawm-i qiyām).

This juxtaposition — indeed, pairing — not only of two concepts, but of two
pivotal verses — Q 33:40 and Q 33:44 — has a dramatic e fect. Among
Muslims worldwide the importance of Q 33:40 is universally acknowledged.
In the Īqān, Bahā’u’llāh places Q 33:44 on a par with Q 33:40. Indeed, as
paramount in prophetic history as the advent of Muḥammad as the “seal of
the prophets” surely is, according to Bahā’u’llāh’s interpretation/argument, of
even greater signi cance is the eschatological encounter with God.

It now remains to be seen how Bahā’u’llāh interprets Q 33:44 and its parallels
(adduced in par. 48 as Q 29:23, 2:46, 2:249, 18:111, 13:2). Arguing that a direct
beati c vision of God is impossible, Bahā’u’llāh reasons that Q 33:44

anticipates a future theophany who, as deus revelatus and divine vicegerent,
is symbolically God by proxy. Similarly, Bahā’u’llāh, in an earlier work, “Gems
of divine mysteries” ( Jawāhir al-asrār), explains:

Know then that the paradise (hādhihi l-janna, lit. “this garden”) that
appeareth on the day of God (yawm Allāh) surpasseth every other paradise
and excelleth the realities of Heaven (ḥaqāʾiq al-riḍwān). For when (baʿd
alladhī, lit. “after”) God—blessed and glori ed is He—sealed the station of
prophethood (maqām al-nubuwwa) in the person of Him who was His friend
(ḥabībihi), His chosen one (ṣa yyihi), and His treasure (khiyaratihi) amongst
His creatures, as hath been revealed from the kingdom of glory: “but he is the
apostle of God and the seal of the prophets” (Q 33:40), He promised all men
that they shall attain unto His own presence on the Day of Resurrection
(waʿada al-ʿibād bi-liqāʾihi yawm al-qiyāma). In this He meant to emphasise
the greatness of the Revelation to come, as it hath indeed been manifested
through the power of truth. (Bahā’u’llāh, “Gems of divine mysteries,” par. 58;
Bahā’u’llāh, Jawāhir al-asrār, par. 58).

Here, a greater “revelation” is posited. Revelation is a concept familiar to all
Muslims. Simply put, Bahā’u’llāh argues at some length in the Īqān that the
Qurʾān presages the advent of the Bāb as the “promised one.” Of even greater
signi cance is what Bahā’u’llāh implies because of this. Scholarship concurs
that the primary eschatological symbol in the Īqān is the Bāb, while, at the
same time, a messianic “secret” pervades it as a subtext, charging the work
with heightened eschatological tension and auguring Bahā’u’llāh’s imminent
declaration of his mission to the discerning, whether before or after
Bahā’u’llāh’s prophetic mission commenced. (Bahā’u’llāh’s “messianic
secrecy” is widely accepted in academic Bahāʾī studies.) Through explicative
logic, the Īqān — arguably the world’s most widely-read non-Muslim
Qurʾānic commentary — served as an advance prophetic warrant for
Bahā’u’llāh’s proclaimed mission to unify the world.

Bahā’u’llāh’s other Qurʾān commentaries include, inter alia, “Commentary on
the mysterious (lit. ‘disconnected’) letters” (Tafsīr-i ḥurūfāt-i muqaṭṭaʿa; see
letters and mysterious letters), which incorporates a discourse on the “Light
verse” (Q 24:35), and “Commentary on ‘He is’” (Tafsīr-i Hū[wa]). As Eschraghi
notes, Bahā’u’llāh “initially engaged in esoteric and allegorical Qurʾānic
exegesis” but, from the 1860s onwards, “the prominence of ‘Islamic’ topics
clearly diminished in Bahā’u’llāh’s writings as he works towards founding a
new religion and introduces distinct doctrines” (Eschraghi, Promised one,
112). Although Islamic topics are largely eclipsed by increasing attention to
expositions of Bahāʾī doctrine and praxis (as would generally be expected in
the emergence of a new religion), Islamic tropes, themes and expositions are
found through Bahāʾī scriptures nonetheless. (See e.g. Necati Alkan, “By the

g and the olive.”)

Since the works of the Bāb, Bahā’u’llāh, and ʿAbdu’l-Bahā constitute the
corpus of Bahāʾī scriptures, the Qurʾān itself, while respected and revered by
Bahāʾīs worldwide, does not occupy a central place in Bahāʾī doctrine and
praxis. However, as a doctrinal posture appreciative of the Qurʾān and of the
contributions of Islam to civilization, Bahāʾīs appreciate, and, will continue
to value, their historical and doctrinal Islamic heritage.
