Báb, Festival of the Birth of the (October 20)

The Festival of the Birth of the Báb is one of five Bahá’ı́ festivals and one of the
nine Bahá’ı́ holy days on which work is to be suspended. Sayyid ‘Alı́ Muhammad

˙
of Shiraz, known by his spiritual title as “the Báb” (“the Gate”), was born on Octo-
ber 20, 1819, in Shı́ráz, Persia (now Iran). The Báb was the founder of a 19th-
century new religious movement generally known as Bábism, the substance of
which was transformed into what is now known as the Bahá’ı́ Faith.

The Báb declared himself to be the long-awaited Qá’im (“Ariser”/“Resurrec-
tor”), the expected eschatological deliverer (known in Sunni Islam as the
“Mahdı́”), who, according to Islamic tradition, would come to revive Islam when
it is at its lowest ebb. While proclaiming himself to be an independent “Manifesta-
tion of God,” the Báb also spoke of the imminent advent of the Promised One, or
“Him whom God shall make manifest.” One of the Báb’s followers, Bahá’u’lláh
(1817–1892), would later receive revelations confirming that he was that Promised
One heralded by the Báb.

According to Armin Eschraghi, the Báb established a new Faith that fulfilled all
the criteria of an independent religion: a new founder, newly revealed scriptures, a
new set of metaphysical and theological teachings distinct from those of Islam,
and new religious laws and principles. In revealing his new code of laws (called
the Bayán), the Báb pursued three major goals: (1) paving the way for the advent
of the Promised One; (2) provoking the clerical establishment and shattering the
foundations of their often-abused institutionalized authority; and (3) proving the
independence of his own religion as distinct from Islam.

Soon after the Báb publicly proclaimed his prophetic mission beginning on the
evening of May 22, 1844, the Persian government began to suppress the move-
ment, and violence ensued. The Báb was arrested and executed by a firing squad
of 750 musketeers on July 9, 1850, in Tabrı́z, Persia. Subsequent to an unauthor-
ized and ill-fated attempt on the life of the Sháh of Persia in 1852, the Sháh
ordered the most brutal tortures and deaths of a great number of Bábı́s, with esti-
mates ranging from around 5,000 to 20,000 martyrs, who, as Browne described
it, were subjected to “[t]errible . . . modes of inflicting death. . . . Of the unfortunate
Bábı́s, some were hewn in pieces, some were sawn asunder, some were flayed with
whips, some were blown from the mouths of mortars” (Browne, “Bábı́ism,” in
Religious Systems of the World, 348).

In the fall of 1852, arrested in the wake of this brutal persecution, Bahá’u’lláh
> was imprisoned in the notorious Siyáh-Chál (“Black Pit”), during which time he
> experienced a series of visions that awakened him to his prophetic destiny. He
> was released but banished, exiled successively to Baghdad (1853–1863), Constan-
> tinople/Istanbul (1863), Adrianople/Edirne (1863–1868), and thence to the prison-
> city of ‘Akká, the vilest penal colony of the Ottoman Empire. In 1892, Bahá’u’lláh
passed away in Bahjı́, near ‘Akká in Palestine (now Israel).

In his article on “Bábı́ism” published that same year, Browne wrote: “I say nothing
> of the mighty influence which, as I believe, the Bábı́ faith will exert in the future, nor
> of the new life it may perchance breathe into a dead people; for, whether it succeed or
> fail, the splendid heroism of the Bábı́ martyrs is a thing eternal and indestructible.”
> The “Bábı́ faith” that Browne spoke of was succeeded by the Bahá’ı́ Faith, which
> has since spread worldwide to become the most widely diffused world religion next
to Christianity, according to the 2001 World Christian Encyclopedia.

Today, Bahá’ı́s accept the Báb as a John the Baptist figure, whose words and
> actions heralded the arrival of Bahá’u’lláh, but also as the cofounder of the Bahá’ı́
> Faith. Unlike John the Baptist in relation to Jesus Christ, the Báb revealed much in
> substance, both in terms of doctrine and religious laws, that was subsequently
revoiced and reenacted, with certain revisions, by Bahá’u’lláh.

Although the Báb did not instruct his followers to formally observe the day of
> his birth, for that occasion, Bahá’u’lláh had revealed the Lawh.-i Mawlúd, which
> awaits an authorized translation. Today, Bahá’ı́s worldwide annually celebrate
> the Birth of the Báb on October 20 as a holy day, with work and school suspended
> for the day. There being no required observances, Bahá’ı́s are free to creatively
> organize commemorative activities, which, although attended mostly by Bahá’ı́s,
are open to people of all faiths and persuasions.

Báb, Festival of the Declaration of the (May 23)

The Festival of the Declaration of the Báb is one of five Bahá’ı́ festivals, and nine
Bahá’ı́ holy days on which work is to be suspended. This holy day commemorates
and celebrates the prophetic mission of the Báb, whose short-lived faith-
community, the Bábı́ religion, was succeeded by the Bahá’ı́ Faith, and whose doc-
trines—as well as several significant religious laws and observances—were taken
up in the Bahá’ı́ religion, effectively making the Báb “the martyr Prophet and co-
founder of their Faith” (Shoghi Effendi, Unfolding Destiny, 233) alongside its
principal founder, Bahá’u’lláh.

The Báb (1819–1850), whose given name was Sayyid ‘Alı́-Muh. ammad of
Shiraz, was the precursor and herald of Bahá’u’lláh (1817–1892), whose given
name was Mı́rzá H.usayn-‘Alı́ Núrı́. The Báb’s relation to Bahá’u’lláh is somewhat
analogous to John the Baptist’s role as the precursor and herald of Jesus Christ. By
“Declaration” is meant two things: (1) the Báb’s announcement of his prophetic
mission; and (2) the moment when the Báb’s first disciple, Akhúnd Mullá H.usayn
Bushrú’ı́ (1813–1849), recognized the Báb’s prophetic mission and became the
first believer. Thus, the Declaration of the Báb took place on the evening of
May 22, 1844. The signal moment was 2 hours and 11 minutes after sunset, as
the Báb himself states, in Persian Bayán 2:7 and 6:13, and also in the Kitáb-i Panj
Sha‘n (“Book of [the] Five Modes [of Revelation]”), revealed exactly six lunar
years later, on March 19, 1850.

The Declaration of the Báb is one of the “two Most Great Festivals” which, in
the words of Bahá’u’lláh, prophet-founder of the Bahá’ı́ Faith, is “that day on
which We [Bahá’u’lláh] raised up the One [the Báb] Who announced unto man-
kind the glad tidings of this Name [Bahá’u’lláh], through which the dead have
been resurrected and all who are in the heavens and on earth have been gathered
together” (Bahá’u’lláh, Kitáb-i-Aqdas, 59 [brackets added]). The Declaration of
the Báb actually falls on the Gregorian calendar date of May 22 in the evening
(i.e., 2 hours and 11 minutes after sunset), but since the Bahá’ı́ day begins at sunset
on what would normally be regarded in the West as the evening before May 23
(i.e., on the evening before the Muslim lunar date of Friday, the fifth day of Jamá-
dı́yu’l-Avval AH 1260 or May 23, 1844). Thus, the Declaration of the Báb is for-
mally listed as May 23, even though it is observed on the evening of May 22.
The other “Most Great Festival” is the 12-day “Festival of Ridván” (April 21–

˙
May 2). What the two “Most Great Festivals” have in common is that they com-
memorate the prophetic declarations of the “Twin Founders” of the Bahá’ı́ Faith,
