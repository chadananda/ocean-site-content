CULTURAL DOCUMENTS

> The chief strategist and "voice" of this cultural movement was philosopher Alain Locke, who edited the premier and
> pivotal anthology of the Harlem Renaissance, The New Negro: An Interpretation (1925), which is described later. As the
> first African American Rhodes Scholar in 1907, Locke studied abroad at Oxford University (1907–1910), the University of
> Berlin, and the College de France (1910–1911), before receiving his PhD in philosophy from Harvard University in 1918.
> Locke figures prominently in the Harlem Renaissance and served as its principal art critic, promoter, and power broker.
> One can say that Alain Locke further democratized American democracy in paving the way for the civil rights movement.
> During the Jim Crow era, when civil rights were white rights (under Plessy v. Ferguson's "separate-but-equal" doctrine),
> Locke was the real genius behind the Harlem Renaissance, which David Levering Lewis (Pulitzer Prize-winning
> biographer of W. E. B. Du Bois) aptly characterized as a movement that sought to achieve "Civil Rights by Copyright." As
> the acknowledged dean of the Harlem Renaissance, Locke may well be regarded as the Martin Luther King Jr. of African
> American culture. Locke's anthology, The New Negro, has been hailed as the first national book of African Americans. He
> ingeniously used culture as a strategy for ameliorating racism and for winning the respect of powerful white elites as
> potential agents for social and political transformation.
> The arc of the rise and fall of the Harlem Renaissance is imprecise. Coexisting with the Jazz Age, the Harlem
> Renaissance was made possible in part by powerful social forces that effected sweeping changes in America at this time,
> beginning with the end of World War I in 1918. Foremost among these forces was the Great Migration, a massive exodus
> of an estimated 13 million African Americans from the rural South to the urban North in the period between 1910 and
> 1930. These shifts in American demography resulted in the rise of a black middle class in major American cities,
> particularly in the Northeast. In the midst of this status revolution, one place stood out in particular: Harlem. With this
> sudden influx of blacks and capital, Harlem became the capital of black America.
> Harlem is a large sector of upper Manhattan in New York City. What was taking place in Harlem was the formation of a
> distinct racial consciousness. Locke characterized this psychic event in that "American Negroes have been a race more in
> name than in fact" or "more in sentiment than in experience," reflecting a "common condition rather than a common
> consciousness." In response to this "problem in common rather than a life in common," the Harlem Renaissance offered
> African Americans their "first chances for group expression and self-determination." The Harlem Renaissance succeeded
> in the first objective, but failed in the latter.
> Parties played a major role both in Harlem night life and in the Renaissance itself, whose official inaugural began with a
> formal banquet. On March 21, 1924, Opportunity editor and sociologist Charles S. Johnson had invited a group of young
> writers and artists to a dinner party of the Writers Guild held in the Civic Club, a restaurant at 14 West 12th Street near
> Fifth Avenue in Harlem. The Civic Club was the only upper-crust New York nightclub free of color or sex restrictions. The
> party was called to celebrate Jessie Redmon Fauset's first novel, There is Confusion, and to recognize a newer school of

> writers that included Eric Walrond, Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes, and Gwendolyn Bennett.
> Evidence suggests that it was Alain Locke himself who originally used the term "Renaissance" to characterize the Harlem
> cultural movement. In 1928, Locke revealed that, during 1924–1925, "the present writer [Locke] articulated these trends
> as a movement toward racial self-expression and cultural autonomy, styling it as the New Negro movement." Published in
> 1925, Harlem: Mecca of the New Negro was an instant success. It sold an estimated 42,000 copies in two printings.
> Capitalizing on this success, Locke expanded the special issue and recast it as an anthology in book form. The New
> Negro: An Interpretation (1925) was the inaugural and the epochal centerpiece of the New Negro movement. The New
> Negro featured 34 contributors, 4 of whom were white. The volume showcased most of the stellar figures of the Harlem
> Renaissance who went on to pursue independent literary and artistic careers in their own right. W. E. B. Du Bois
> contributed the final essay. Locke proclaimed The New Negro to be "our spiritual Declaration of Independence."
> The prime movers of the Harlem Renaissance believed that art held more promise than politics in bringing about a sea
> change in American race relations. Although their philosophies of art had shades of differences, their overlap intensified
> their commonality. As the chief proponent of the "talented tenth," Du Bois was staunch in his conviction that art should
> serve the interests of the race. In "Criteria of Negro Art" (1926), Du Bois bluntly demands that art should be used explicitly
> for propaganda. In Locke's view, the problem with propaganda is that it "harangues, cajoles, threatens, or supplicates,"
> and operates from a defensive posture. In his classic essay, "The Legacy of the Ancestral Arts," in The New Negro,
> Locke proclaims what the function of art must be: "Art must discover and reveal the beauty which prejudice and caricature
> have overlaid. And all vital art discovers beauty and opens our eyes to that which previously we could not see." Although
> it was true that the Harlem Renaissance enjoyed a double audience, the primary audience was white. Locke wrote that in
> its purest form, beauty will be the vehicle of truth: "After Beauty, let Truth come into the Renaissance picture."
> In 1926, Langston Hughes published his manifesto, "The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain," in The Nation, which was
> cited as a sacred text by the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s. Hughes takes a diffident, almost devil-may-care
> approach: "We younger Negro artists who create now intend to express our individual dark-skinned selves without fear or
> shame. If white people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, it doesn't matter. We know we are beautiful. And ugly
> too." Locke praised the essay as a "declaration of cultural independence." In his preface to The Book of American Negro
> Poetry (1931), editor James Weldon Johnson wrote that each people is judged by the standard of its own culture. In his
> November 1928 Harper's magazine essay, "Race Prejudice and the Negro Artist," Johnson argues that, while racism was
> being fought on educational, economic, political and sociological fronts, it is the African American artist who was charged
> with undermining racial prejudice. Johnson's philosophy of art agrees with and synthesizes those of Du Bois and Locke in
> that producing great black art is a key to gaining a reciprocity of respect.
> Art is a surplus of creative energy. Art requires support. Thus much of the creative work of black artists and writers was
> dependent on white patrons and persons of influence, who were key protagonists of the Harlem Renaissance. This is a
> remarkable fact. Legally barred from congregating socially, it was practically illegal for blacks and whites to have social
> relationships beyond the most impersonal kinds of interactions. Still, white patrons played a key role in publishing for and
> marketing black arts to white consumers for their mutual enrichment. Carl Van Vechten was probably the pivotal white
> promoter of the Harlem Renaissance. In 1926, he published Nigger Heaven, a controversial novel about black life in
> Harlem. Van Vechten was often excoriated for the title. Nigger Heaven was partly a collaborative black-white effort:
> James Weldon Johnson and Walter White read the galley proofs, and poet Langston Hughes wrote verses to replace
> song lyrics that Van Vechten had used without permission, which prompted a lawsuit.
> A patron of Alain Locke, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, and others, Charlotte Osgood Mason was a secret
> benefactor of major Harlem Renaissance artists and writers. She eschewed publicity and forbade the very mention of her
> name. Instructing her patrons to refer to her affectionately as "Godmother," her purse had strings attached. This fact has
> jaundiced Harlem Renaissance art in the eyes of its critics, for Mason's obsession with African primitivism had to be
> satisfied. Nonetheless, Mason's patronage was the lifeblood of some of the key Renaissance figures.
> "Negro poets and Negro poetry are two quite different things," Locke wrote in 1926. "Of the one, since Phyllis Wheatley,
> we have had a century and a half; of the other, since Dunbar, scarcely a generation." The advent of a self-conscious
> Negro poetry by Negro poets helped cultivate the group consciousness that Locke found to be singularly lacking among
> African Americans historically yet developing rather suddenly in his generation. As Locke predicted, the Harlem
> Renaissance poets have entered into the canon of mainstream American literature.
> A West Indian and British citizen, Claude McKay contributed the poem, "White House," to The New Negro anthology.
> Because of its politically sensitive nature, Locke changed the title to "White Houses." In his social protest poem, "To
> America," McKay personifies the United States as a tiger, racially terrible yet magnificent in its awesome power. McKay's

> greatest claim to fame is his military sonnet, "If We Must Die," which appeared in the July issue of The Liberator during
> the Red Summer of 1919, when race riots swept across 25 of the nation's inner cities like a firestorm. The poem, McKay
> says, "exploded out of me" and is now considered to be the inaugural address of the Harlem Renaissance. This poem
> took on the power of an anthem: it was reprinted by virtually every leading African American magazine and newspaper.
> McKay's sonnet surpassed race when Winston Churchill used "If We Must Die" to rally British soldiers in battles against
> the Nazis in World War II.
> Disinclined to identify himself as a black poet, Countee Cullen could not ignore the pain of the black experience. With
> Keats as his poetic idol, Cullen used white poetic forms, such as the sonnet, to solemnify that angst. Harper and Brothers
> published his first volume of poems, Colors, in 1925, which won the first Harmon Foundation Award in Literature in 1926.
> In Harvard Graduate School in 1926, Cullen took a course in versification from Robert Hillyer, who paid tribute to Cullen
> as the first American poet to publish a poem in rime royal. In 1926, Cullen became assistant editor of Opportunity
> magazine, and began to write a regular column, 'The Dark Tower." On April 9, 1928, Cullen married Nina Yolande,
> daughter of W. E B. Du Bois, in an event hailed as the social event of the decade. However, the marriage was short-
> lived.
> Acclaimed by many as the poet-laureate of the Harlem Renaissance, Langston Hughes was "discovered" in 1924 by poet
> Vachel Lindsay, who was Hughes's literary idol. Hughes was a busboy at the time and had seized the opportunity to give
> Lindsay some poems when the latter dined at the Washington, D.C. hotel where Hughes worked. At a formal banquet
> hosted by Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life (organ of the National Urban League) to present awards for its annual
> poetry contest, Langston Hughes won second prize for 'The Weary Blues," which became the title of the collection of
> poems published by Knopf in 1926 on the recommendation of Van Vechten, who personally hand-delivered the
> manuscript to the publisher and wrote the foreword as well. Locke credits Hughes with bringing about, for the first time, a
> "revelation of the emotional color of Negro life, and his brilliant discovery of the flow and rhythm of the modern and
> especially the city Negro, substituting the jazz figure and personality for the older plantation stereotype."
> Locke also recognized the contribution of visual artists to the Harlem Renaissance: "The Negro artist thus found his place
> beside the poets and writers of the 'New Negro' movement, which in the late Twenties and through the Thirties galvanized
> Negro talent to strong and freshly creative expression." In addition, Harlem Renaissance artists helped develop a visual
> vocabulary and grammar of images representing African Americans. In the 1925 Harlem issue of the Survey Graphic,
> Locke published seven portraits of Harlem folk, sketched by Winold Reiss. Son of Fritz Reiss, a landscape painter,
> Winold studied under Franz von Stuck of Munich. "Winold Reiss has achieved," Locke claimed, "what amounts to a
> revealing discovery of the significance, human and artistic, of one of the great dialects of human physiognomy, of some of
> the little understood but powerful idioms of nature's speech." Locke praised Reiss for achieving, through painting locally in
> Harlem, a universality of the human experience.
> Acknowledged by some as the father of black American visual art, Aaron Douglas was recognized by Locke as "the
> pioneer of the African Style among the American Negro artists." In addition to being an illustrator, whose work first
> appeared in the Harlem issue and then in The New Negro, Douglas was a muralist, whose work was featured at Club
> Ebony in New York, in the Sherman Hotel in Chicago, and in Fisk University. In developing his distinctive style, Douglas
> contributed the illustrations to God's Trombones (1927), by James Weldon Johnson, which features cycles of sermon-
> poems. Douglas drew on Egyptian and African art and was influenced by Cubism, Art Deco, and Art Nouveau as well.
> These illustrations are considered to be Douglas's finest work.
> A bodybuilder as well as a writer, Jean Toomer was a biracial man, who could pass for white, and ultimately did. In 1923,
> he published Cane, a novel set in Georgia, which Langston Hughes praised as the best prose ever written by an African
> American, and which Locke hailed as "a brilliant performance." Toomer was a one-book author, whose career was
> abortive for personal reasons. In spiritual pursuit of the "four-conscinal" and "illuminant" Absolute, Toomer subsequently
> became a follower of the mystic Gurdjieff and married a wealthy white woman, Margery Latimer. When James Weldon
> Johnson invited Toomer to contribute to a revised edition of The Book of American Negro Poetry (1931), Toomer refused,
> no longer wishing to identify himself as a "Negro."
> Born of a Danish mother and a West Indian father, Nella Larsen won the Harmon Foundation's Bronze Medal for
> Literature in 1929 for her novel Quicksand (1928), which W. E. B. Du Bois acclaimed as comparable in quality to the
> fictional works of Charles Chesnutt. Although legally black, she had loyalties to both races, a theme of racial fusion and
> confusion explored in Quicksand, in which the main character, Helga Crane, is a full projection of Larsen herself. Locke
> describes Quicksand as a "study of the cultural conflict of mixed ancestry" and hails it as a "truly social document of
> importance" that illuminates "the problem of divided social loyalties and . . . the conflict of cultures." In 1930, Larsen
> became the first black woman to win a Guggenheim Fellowship.

> There are more than 130 published plays by 37 Harlem Renaissance authors. On May 22, 1921, Shuffle Along opened at
> Broadway's David Belasco Theater. With lyrics written by Noble Sissle and music by Eubie Blake, Shuffle Along became
> the first musical revue scored and performed by African Americans. It launched the careers of Josephine Baker and
> Florence Mills. In addition, Locke categorized three American plays as "outstanding": Eugene O'Neill's The Emperor
> Jones, Paul Green's Pulitzer Prize-winning In Abraham's Bosom, and DuBose Heyward's Charleston folk-drama, Porgy.
> The year 1929 was a big one for Harlem renaissance drama: the Negro Experimental Theatre was founded in February,
> the Negro Art Theatre was formed in June, and the National Colored Players was created in September. That same year,
> Wallace Thurman collaborated with white journalist and playwright William Jourdan Rapp to write a murder melodrama,
> Harlem. Produced with an all-black cast (except for a white police officer), the Broadway performances of Harlem proved
> a significant milestone in the development of black drama. It opened at the Apollo Theater on Broadway and was a huge
> success.
> The Harlem Renaissance arose during the period of American progressivism, with its faith in the reform of democracy.
> Ultimately, the Harlem Renaissance crashed along with the stock market in the early years of the Great Depression, and
> its failure to effect any real social change was dramatically underscored by the Harlem Riot of 1935. Without a unifying
> ideology, the Renaissance was given over to exoticism and exhibitionism and failed in its stated mission to solve the
> racial crisis through cultural diplomacy. It was not so much that the Harlem Renaissance failed; rather it was America that
> failed the Harlem Renaissance. This failed impact was the fate of modernist movements in general, which sought to
> create a social conscience for the age of modernity. Yet Houston A. Baker sees the publication of Locke's The New
> Negro (1925) as a success in its own right. The Harlem Renaissance created a place in the national literary tradition,
> officially recognized in the March 13, 2002, "White House Salute to America's Authors" event, which paid tribute to writers
> of the Harlem Renaissance who created rich art and became agents of social change. The Harlem Renaissance's cultural
> diplomacy had become a cultural legacy.
