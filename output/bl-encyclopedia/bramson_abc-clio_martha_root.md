Martha Louise Root

> Martha Root was a Baha'i missionary. Shoghi Effendi had heralded her as a unique apostle of Baha'u'llah.
> Although she was no longer young, had limited financial means, had cancer, and was afraid, lonely, and
> physically frail, she traveled several times around the world during eight lengthy trips to disseminate the Baha'i
> faith in as many parts of the globe as possible. She is primarily remembered for her intrepid, pioneering,
> audacious, and persevering spirit.

> Martha Root, born in 1872, was raised in Pennsylvania and attended Oberlin College, but she eventually
> graduated from the University of Chicago in 1895. Her professional career began as a teacher, principal, and then
> a lecturer. However, in 1900 she was able to establish herself as a journalist. She became a Baha'i in 1909 and
> met Abdul-Baha in 1912. This was a pivotal experience in her spiritual development. In 1915, supporting herself
> as a journalist supplying stories to U.S. newspapers and magazines, she departed on her first trip for the Baha'i
> faith, traveling to Europe, Egypt, Asia, and Hawaii. In Egypt, she served as an early foreign correspondent,
> reporting on the displacement of the Jews from Palestine by the Ottoman Empire. In 1919, she left for South
> America, the Caribbean, and the southern coast of the United States. After some short travels in Canada and the
> United States, in 1921 she traveled to Mexico and Guatemala. When her mother died, she remained at home to
> care for her father. When her father died in 1922, she was free to dedicate herself to traveling to spread her
> religion, barely supporting herself through journalism and odd jobs.

> Root started with a cross-country trip through the United States, and then from 1923 to 1925 went to Australia
> and New Zealand, Asia, and Africa. During the next four years, she traveled in Palestine, Europe, and Turkey. In
> Palestine she completed a pilgrimage to the Baha'i holy shrines and met Shoghi Effendi. From the end of 1929 to
> 1931, starting with Egypt, she crisscrossed the Middle East, Asia, and Hawaii. During this time she was again
> able to meet Shoghi Effendi. While in Iran, she gathered material and wrote the first book ever published on
> Tahirih. After spending one year traveling in the United States, from 1932 to 1936 she roamed Europe, including
> the Balkans, and the European part of Turkey. After a 10-month semi-rest from traveling, which she spent in the
> United States, the following two years saw her return to Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. Martha Root, soaring
> in what she called "spiritual skylarking," braved through strikes, epidemics, illness, extreme fatigue, revolutions,
> civil strife, bombing, war, and rigorous forms of transportation, including an icy crossing of the Andes by mule, to
> accomplish her goal of disseminating the Baha'i teachings. She finally succumbed to cancer and died in Hawaii,
> where a monument was erected in her honor. In 1939, soon after her death, Martha Root was called by the
> guardian of the Baha'i faith the foremost Hand of the Cause of God, the highest spiritual station a Baha'i can
> attain.
