Tahirih Qurratul-ayn

> Tahirih (The Pure One), also known as Qurratul-ayn (Consolation of the Eyes), was a leading figure in the Babi
> movement, the only woman among the "Letters of the Living" (the first and highest-ranking group of the Bab's
> disciples). Tahirih is considered the outstanding woman of the Babi religion and was regarded by the Babis as the
> return of Fatima bint Muhammad, the daughter of the prophet Muhammad, from whom she was descended
> through her mother. Her holiness may be thought to reside, at least partly, in the compelling manner in which she
> interpreted the sacred role of Fatima. She has become for many Iranian women a symbol and icon of the
> women's movement. For Baha'is she has come to symbolize their concern for the equality of women and social
> action, and girls are frequently named after her.

> Tahirih was born in the Iranian city of Qazvin to a family of leading Islamic clerics in 1817. From her earliest
> years, she showed extraordinary abilities, memorizing the Koran and grasping abstruse points of religious law
> and theology. She was also very beautiful and a talented poetess. She was married to her cousin and had four
> children. She became an enthusiastic supporter of the teachings of Sheikh Ahmad al-Ahsai, despite the fact that
> her husband and father-in-law were virulent enemies of the sheikh. Eventually, in 1843, Tahirih left for Karbala to
> meet with Sayyid Kazim Rashti, the successor to Sheikh Ahmad. Unfortunately, Sayyid Kazim had died by the
> time Tahirih arrived, but, with his wife's permission, she set up in Sayyid Kazim's home and continued his
> teaching circle, teaching the men from behind a curtain.

> In 1844, news reached her of the claims of the Bab and she immediately accepted these, becoming one of the 18
> Letters of the Living. She began to teach this message in Karbala. At the end of 1847, she was arrested and sent
> to Baghdad, where she resided at the home of the mufti of Baghdad. The Ottoman authorities decided to expel
> her and she returned to Qazvin. Here, she was involved in further confrontations with her father-in-law and
> husband, which ended in their divorce. When in October 1847 her father-in-law was murdered, her husband
> accused Tahirih of complicity in the crime, and her life was in danger until Baha'u'llah, founder of the Baha'i faith,
> arranged for her removal from Qazvin.

> Tahirih attended the Conference of Badasht in summer 1848, at which most of the leading Babis were present.
> Here she proclaimed the advent of a new religious dispensation by appearing unveiled. Shortly after this
> conference she was arrested and held at the home of the kalantar (mayor) of Tehran. She captivated her captors
> and succeeded in converting to Babism some women from the highest reaches of society, including a royal
> princess. In 1852, Tahirih, at the age of 35, was strangled and her body thrown into a well.
