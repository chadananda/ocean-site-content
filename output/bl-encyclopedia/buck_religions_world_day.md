**About the book:** _Religions of the World_ (Second Edition), in six volumes, brings together the scholarship of experts from around the globe. The encyclopedia offers entries on every country of the world, with particular emphasis both on the larger nations as well as profiles on religion in some of the world's most remote places (e.g. Antarctica and Easter Island). This collection is unique in that it is based in religion "on the ground," tracing the development of each of the 16 major world religious traditions through its institutional expressions in the modern world, its major geographical sites, and its major celebrations.
