Many of the writings of the Bāb are permeated with Islamic and other eschatological texts and traditions. Individual Babis and Bahais have also compiled testimonia and written “demonstrative treatises” (_estedlālīya_) to show the fulfillment, in their religion, of apocalyptic and eschatological prophecies (e.g., see Iran National Bahāʾī Manuscript Collection \[INBMC\], LXXX and bibliography under Golpaygānī, 1925 and Sears).

In 1260/1844 the Bāb claimed to inaugurate a new era of communication with the Hidden Imam and, a few years later, claimed to be the expected Qāʾem or Mahdi. According to him, the awaited Day of resurrection (_yawm al-qīāma_) and associated eschatological events, largely spiritually understood, were set in motion or were believed to have come to pass (see, e.g., _Dalāʾel_, pp. 13, 25, 34, 49 ff.; INBMC, LXXX/1; Amanat, index, s.v. _qiyāma_). Many sections of the Persian and Arabic _Bayān_s as well as the late _Haykal al-dīn_ (1850) of the Bāb expound eschatological matters (e.g., _mawt_ “death,” _al-qabr_ “the tomb,” the _ṣerāt_Â bridge, _mīzān_ “the balance”; _Bayān-e fārsī_ 2:8-9, 2:12-13). The Bāb’s first disciples were identified as the (spiritual) return (_rojūʿ_) of the “fourteen immaculate ones” (_čahārdah maʿṣūm_, and other Shiʿite worthies (_Bayān-e fārsī_ 1:1-19; cf. Mīrzā Jānī, p. 199). Using Sufi terminology (Goldziher, p. 254) the Bāb made frequent reference to imminent as well as futuristic advents of “him whom God shall make manifest” (_man yoẓheroho Allāh_; see Browne, pp. lxix f.), whose manifestation represents the encounter with God (_leqāʾ Allāh_) mentioned in the Koran (6:31, 10:45; Bāb, _Haykal al-dīn_ 3:7). Exactly when this messiah figure would first appear is said to be a divine secret. The time is variously intimated in the Bāb’s writings (cf. MacEoin, 1986, pp. 126 ff.). There exists what appears to be a kind of _terminus a quo_ of 1511 (i.e., _abjad_, value of _aḡyaṯ_ “the most assisting”) and a _terminus ad quem_ of 2001 (i.e., _abjad_ value of _mostaḡāṯ_ “the one invoked”) years set down in certain late writings (_Bayān-e fārsī_ 2:16). Azalī Bābīs have tended to highlight the futurity of _man yoẓheroho Allāh_’s appearance in their anti-Bahai polemic (Momen, “Azal, Azalīs”). The Bāb saw his own dispensation as a kind of eschatological ‘messianic interregnum’ to be followed, from age to age, by nine or more successive manifestations of _man yoẓheroho Allāh_ (_Panj šaʾn_, pp. 314-15, cf. p. 397).

During the 1850s Bahāʾ-Allāh spoke of himself as the “return” of Imam Ḥosayn, later claiming to be the one promised in _mostaḡāt_ with the name _man yoẓheroho Allāh_ (unpub. letter to Mīrzā Asad-Allāh Nūrī) and the return of all past major Prophets and expected messiah figures within both Semitic and non-Semitic religions. It was during the Reżwān (i.e., Najebīya garden in Baghdad) declaration period (22 April-3 May 1863), that Bahāʾ-Allāh initially made something of his messianic claims known to a few Bābīs on the outskirts of Baghdad, also stating that no future manifestation of God (_maẓhar-e elāhī_) would succeed him for at least 1,000 (solar) years (see INBMC, XLIV, p. 225; _al–Ketāb al-aqdas_, p. 113, tr. p. 32). Ultimately, he claimed to be the promised messianic advent of Divinity: the eschatological advent of Yahweh (YHWH, the tetragrammaton); the return of Christ as the “Father”; the appearance of Allāh the Self-Subsisting (_al-qayyūm_). Many of his letters explain Islamic and Judaeo-Christian eschatology (see, e.g., _Ketāb-e īqān_; _Tablets . . . after Aqdas_, pp. 9-17, 117-119; cf. McLaughlin). Relative to non-Semitic religions Bahāʾ-Allāh referred to himself as the Zoroastrian Shah Bahrām (_lawḥ-e haft porseš_) and is viewed as Kalki, the tenth Avatār of Vishnu or the spiritual “reincarnation of Krishna,” expected by some Hindus. In addition, he is considered by some Bahais to be the fifth Buddha Maitreya or Amitābha, the ruler of the western paradise of Sukhāvatī (Shoghi Effendi, 1944, pp. 94 ff). Certain eschatological prophecies found within Hindu, Zoroastrian, and Buddhist texts are given detailed interpretation by Bahais (e.g., Fozdar; Momen, 1990, pp. 33-37).
