‘Alavíyyih Khánum (c. 1855–c. 1918),
and ‘Alí Ján, Mullá (1846–83)
Married couple, both distinguished Iranian teachers of the Bahá’í Faith; Mullá ‘Alí
Ján was executed in Tehran for his faith.

 ARTICLE OUTLINE:                                     EARLY YEARS
      Early Years                                     Hamídih, who became known as ‘Alavíyyih
       Bahá'í Activities to 1883                      Khánum, was born in Máhfurúzak in the province
       ‘Alavíyyih Khánum in Widowhood                 of Mazandaran in northern Iran in about 1855. Her
                                                      mother was named Khurshíd; her father, Áqá

                                                      Mírzá Áqá Ján, was a distinguished resident of the
       Sources and Related Reading                    village. Because Hamídih was a descendant of the
                                                      Prophet Muhammad and of the Imam Ali, she was
called ‘Alavíyyih, the feminine derivative of the name of the Prophet’s son-in-law, Ali.

Mullá ‘Alí Ján, the son of Áqá Ja‘far and Áminih Khánum, was born in the nearby village of Ríkandih in
1846. His parents died while he was young, and his uncle Áqá Mírzá Áqá Ján enabled Mullá ‘Alí Ján to
complete his education as a mullá in the towns of Sárí and Barfurush (now Babul). Mullá ‘Alí Ján then
spent a year in the village of Surkhrúd before his uncle summoned him to Máhfurúzak to become the
religious leader of the village (píshnamáz, prayer leader, and rawdih-khán, reciter of traditional
lamentations for the imams, especially the martyred Husayn). About three years later, Áqá Mírzá Áqá
Ján died. His final wish was that his daughter, ‘Alavíyyih Khánum, wed Mullá ‘Alí Ján. The cousins were
married in 1871, when ‘Alavíyyih Khánum was sixteen.

BAHÁ'Í ACTIVITIES TO 1883
While studying in Barfurush, Mullá ‘Alí Ján had been introduced to the Bahá’í Faith by Ustád Muhammad
Kuláh-dúz and had been convinced of the truth of the new religion by Áqá Siyyid Muhammád Ridá
Shahmírzádí, a traveling Bahá’í teacher. For Mullá ‘Alí Ján’s first three years as religious leader of
Máhfurúzak, during which he gained the love and respect of the entire village, he did not reveal his new
faith to anyone. Shortly after his uncle’s death, however, Mullá ‘Alí Ján began to talk about his beliefs
with his wife and other members of his uncle’s family, all of whom became Bahá’ís. He also began to
teach the Bahá’í Faith openly from the pulpit. His efforts were enhanced by the high regard in which
the villagers held him, and a majority of the inhabitants of Máhfurúzak soon became Bahá’ís. His travels
to surrounding villages led to similar results; he brought many people in the environs of Máhfurúzak
into the Bahá’í Faith.

Mullá ‘Alí Ján and ‘Alavíyyih Khánum, not content with the conversion of the inhabitants of Máhfurúzak
to the Bahá’í Faith, started to organize the life of the village on a spiritual basis. They encouraged each
family to set aside a special room for prayer. There, wearing clean attire rather than work clothes, the
family members would pray daily in the morning and evening. Mullá ‘Alí Ján and ‘Alavíyyih Khánum
established two schools, one for girls and the other for boys, enabling all the children of the village to
receive an elementary education. These appear to have been the first Bahá’í schools established in the
country. In addition, the couple organized classes where villagers were able to discuss religious matters.

Mullá ‘Alí Ján and ‘Alavíyyih Khánum also made efforts to improve the economic basis of the village.
They initiated a buying and selling cooperative, through which Máhfurúzak’s farmers could obtain better
prices for their fruit and rice, and arranged for residents to learn crafts so that they could make some
of the necessities of life. The couple also developed a new source of income for the village: the buying
of cotton to be cleaned, carded, and sold to Russian and Armenian merchants for export to Russia.

News of the changes taking place in Máhfurúzak began to reach the ulama (Muslim religious leaders) in
Sárí. Presumably, they saw the developments in the village as challenges to the existing order in rural
Iran and to their own authority, for they reported to the provincial governor that the inhabitants of
Máhfurúzak were planning an insurrection. When the information was conveyed to the central
government, investigators were dispatched to the village, but they found nothing amiss. The ulama did
not relent, however, and continued sending their allegations to the shah. Eventually, the government
acceded and ordered Mullá ‘Alí Jan’s arrest.

At dawn on 29 April 1883, some four hundred horsemen raided the village of Máhfurúzak, looted many
houses, and arrested Mullá ‘Alí Ján, three of his brothers-in-law, and four others, taking them to Sárí.
Later the same day, another fifty horsemen swept into the village. They apprehended ‘Alavíyyih
Khánum, five other women, and two men and confiscated all of ‘Alavíyyih Khánum’s and Mullá ‘Alí Ján’s
books and possessions. The couple’s six-year-old daughter, Baqá’íyyih, would not be separated from
‘Alavíyyih Khánum and was taken away with the prisoners, all of whom were detained for a time before
being released.

A large armed escort took Mullá ‘Alí Ján and the seven arrested with him to Tehran. His companions
were thrown into a dungeon, where they remained for two years, but Mullá ‘Alí Ján was singled out for
execution. He was killed in the city’s public execution square on 28 June 1883, after which his body
was put on display for three days until two Bahá’í women, at great risk to themselves, managed to
remove the remains for burial. Bahá’u’lláh honored Mullá ‘Alí Ján’s life and martyrdom with a "tablet of
visitation" (a prayer, often in the form of a eulogy, to be read when visiting the grave site of an
eminent person).

‘ALAVÍYYIH KHÁNUM IN WIDOWHOOD
‘Alavíyyih Khánum was twenty-eight years old when her husband was executed. Three years later, her
two children became ill and died as well. Having lost her husband and children, ‘Alavíyyih Khánum
devoted the rest of her life entirely to the Bahá’í Faith. She continued the reforms that she and her
husband had started in the village, concentrating especially on the education of children, both girls and
boys. Her efforts caused her to become the most prominent Bahá’í in Máhfurúzak.

                                       ‘Alavíyyih Khánum also began to travel as a teacher of the
                                       Bahá’í Faith. At first, in the years following the death of her
                                       children, she visited nearby villages in Mazanderan, such as
                                       ‘Arabkhayl and Bihnamír, as well as towns such as Barfurush,
                                       ‘Aliyábád, and Sárí. She spoke persuasively and brought many
                                       people into the Bahá’í Faith.

                                       Later, at ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s request, she began to travel more
                                       extensively. In 1901 she undertook a major trip to the Iranian
                                       province of Khurasan and then to Ashgabat in Russian
                                       Turkmenistan and beyond. After this trip she visited ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
Mazandaran village scene Wikipedia
                                       in Palestine.

Early in 1903, while in Mashhad, she received a letter from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá instructing her to proceed to
the city of Yazd together with her nephew and Mírzá Husayn Zanjání, a devout Bahá’í teacher who had
been imprisoned with the noted martyrs Mírzá ‘Alí Muhammad Varqá and his twelve-year-old son,
Rúhu’lláh, in Tehran in 1896 and who is remembered for his account of their last days. While ‘Alavíyyih
Khánum and her companions were traveling as part of a caravan, an upheaval began in Yazd. The city’s
new imám-jum‘ih (leader of Friday prayers), spurred by the Mujtahid of Isfahan, Shaykh Muhammad
Taqí (known to Bahá’ís as the Son of the Wolf), preached in the mosque against the Bahá’ís,
unleashing an outbreak of violent persecution in June and July 1903 that resulted in the death of scores
of Bahá’í men, women, and children. When news of the events in Yazd reached the caravan, their fellow
travelers turned against ‘Alavíyyih Khánum and her party and began abusing them. By the time they
arrived in Yazd, a crowd had gathered to attack them, but government authorities dispersed it.

From Yazd, ‘Alavíyyih Khánum went to Ábádih, a small town in the province of Fárs. She remained
there for a few months before returning to Máhfurúzak by way of Tehran.

In her later years, ‘Alavíyyih Khánum became blind and was unable to leave Máhfurúzak. Before she
died in about 1918, she donated her house as a Bahá’í center and place of worship (See: Mashriqu’l-
Adhkár). ‘Abdu’l-Bahá honored her by giving her the title Amatu’l-Bahá (Maidservant of Bahá) and by
writing a tablet of visitation for her.
