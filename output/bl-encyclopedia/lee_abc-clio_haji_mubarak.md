Haji Mubarak

> Haji Mubarak, the famed "Ethiopian servant" of the Bab (Sayyid Ali-Muhammad Shirazi, founder of Babism who
> lived from 1819 to1850), is celebrated in Baha'i literature for his saintliness and loyalty. Born in 1833, he was a
> slave sold in Iran at the age of five to the Bab's uncle, Haji Mirza Abul-Qasim, and educated within the uncle's
> household. In all probability, he had been castrated when taken captive in Africa and was a eunuch.

> At the age of 19, the Bab—returning to Shiraz after a six-year absence—purchased Mubarak from his uncle for
> 14 tumans (about $28). Mubarak served the Bab and his family for the rest of his life. He was deeply involved in
> the events surrounding the founding of the Babi religion and was present (in an adjoining room) on May 22, 1844,
> when the Bab first declared his mission, beginning (for Baha'is) a new era in religious history.

> Only two early believers were chosen to accompany the Bab on his subsequent pilgrimage to Mecca in 1844 and
> 1845, Quddus (Mirza Muhammad-Ali Barfarushi, the first in rank of the Bab's disciples) and Mubarak. The Bab is
> recorded to have sacrificed, in accordance with the customs of Islamic pilgrimage, 19 lambs in Mecca—nine in
> his own name, seven in the name of Quddus, and three for Mubarak, securing for the latter the full benefits of the
> hajj to Mecca. When the Bab was arrested and exiled to Isfahan, Mubarak remained in Shiraz to serve and
> protect the Bab's wife (Khadijih Bagum) and mother. After the Bab's execution in 1850, his mother and
> grandmother were forced to transfer their residence to Karbala in Iraq. Mubarak accompanied them there and
> died in their service in around 1873 at about the age of 40.

> After 1850, to salvage their respectability, members of the Bab's family maintained that the Bab had not been
> executed but was still alive on an extended business trip to India. Haji Mubarak helped to uphold this public fiction
> by vowing to sweep the courtyard around the tomb of Imam Husayn b. Ali in Karbala every day until his master
> should return. He performed this pious duty faithfully every morning until his death.
