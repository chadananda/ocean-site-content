of Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore—where temples to the Mother of the Dipper
and her nine star sons are still popular. The Dipper Mother is still worshipped in a
few places in China, most notably at the White Cloud Temple in Beijing, but the
most impressive festivals for her sons are found at such places as Phuket Island
(Thailand); Penang, Butterworth, and Ampang (Malaysia); and Singapore.

Bahá’ı́s gather together once every 19 days to participate in their local commun-
ities’ “Nineteen-Day Feast.” To those unfamiliar with the Bahá’ı́ Faith, this might
seem like odd timing, but it is perfectly in keeping with the seasonal rhythm of the
Bahá’ı́ calendar of 19 months of 19 days. In the Bahá’ı́ calendar, each day, month,
year and cycle of years is named after a godly attribute that can be expressed as a
goodly virtue. The Nineteen-Day Feast is at the heart of Bahá’ı́ community life
and is an essential feature of the “community building” that takes place in each
local Bahá’ı́ faith-community, which is typically defined by city/town boundaries.
Unlike those religious “congregations,” where believers choose the particular
group with whom they wish to affiliate, Bahá’ı́s in a given town must learn to func-
tion together not as a congregation but as a community, both socially and for pur-
poses of local administration. This structure is itself conducive to achieving the
purposes of the Bahá’ı́ Faith—to eliminate barriers and prejudices of all kinds,
and to bring about unity through concerted action.

An integral part of the Bahá’ı́ calendar, the first day of each Bahá’ı́ month is
often referred to as the “Feast Day.” While the Nineteen-Day Feast is not one of
the nine Bahá’ı́ holy days on which work is suspended, the Bahá’ı́ Feast, infor-
mally at least, functions as though it were a “monthly” Bahá’ı́ holy day. It is a time
of worship, deliberation, and fellowship, as reflected in the three formal phases
(i.e., devotional, consultative, and social) of each Bahá’ı́ Feast comprising its spiri-
tual, administrative, and unitive functions.

Historically, the Nineteen-Day Feast has its origins in the religion of the
Báb (1819–1850), the herald and precursor of Bahá’u’lláh (1819–1892), the

> prophet-founder of the Bahá’ı́ Faith. In the Arabic Bayán, the Báb commanded his
> followers to invite 19 people every 19 days, even if one is able to offer only water
> in this offer of hospitality. Bahá’u’lláh ratified this practice in the Most Holy
> Book: “Verily, it is enjoined upon you to offer a feast, once in every month, though
> only water be served; for God hath purposed to bind hearts together, albeit through
> both earthly and heavenly means” (Bahá’u’lláh, The Kitáb-i-Aqdas, 40). Here, the
> primary purpose of the Feast is “to bind hearts together”—that is, to produce unity
among the believers.
The term, “Feast” (Arabic, dı́yáfat) primarily means “hospitality” and has been

˙
> used in connection with sacred events, such as the Lord’s Supper, portrayed in the
> Qur’an (Q. 5:112–15) as a banquet table descending from heaven, from which the
> disciples ate. “Feast” includes “both earthly and heavenly” food, with spiritual
> sustenance being the latter meaning. Thus, in current practice, refreshments are
> commonly served in the social portion of the Feast, after the spiritual enrichment
> of the devotional portion of Feast, consisting primarily of prayers and readings
> from the Bahá’ı́ scriptures. In some Bahá’ı́ communities, there may on occasion
> be a dinner (whether a “potluck” or provided by the host) that takes place before
the formal Feast program begins.

The Nineteen-Day Feast was further developed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and Shoghi
> Effendi. During the time of the Báb and Baha’u’llah, the Feast was individually
> observed as the offer of hospitality to guests invited to the home. During the min-
> istry of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, however, the Feast became communal in character and was
> essentially institutionalized. Of this development, Bahá’ı́ historian Robert Stock-
> man wrote:

> In early 1905 Howard and Mary MacNutt and Julia Grundy attended a Feast
> hosted by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in Akka. The celebration included Bahá’ı́s from many
> parts of the world and was especially moving . . . The next morning at breakfast
> ‘Abdu’l-Bahá praised the Feast, adding, “You must meet together in this way in
> America.” The three pilgrims took His exhortation as a commandment. After
> returning home Howard MacNutt consulted with the New York Board of Coun-
> sel and it organized the first real Feast known to have been held in North
> America. It occurred on 23 May 1905 in New York City. . . . Isabella Britting-
> ham took the Feast to the rest of the United States. . . . In early 1906 she vis-
> ited Johnstown, New York; Chicago; Kenosha; Racine; Milwaukee;
> Minneapolis; and Cleveland. In all of these cities she inaugurated the Feast
> as a formal community event. (Stockman, The Bahá’ı́ Faith in America:
> Early Expansion, 1900–1912)

‘Abdu’l-Bahá stressed the devotional character of these gatherings and their
> unitive function in providing greater social cohesion among the Bahá’ı́ faithful,
> and promised that “all its mystic meanings” would unfold in the faithful obser-
vance of the Bahá’ı́ Feast (Selections from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 91).

Perhaps one of the mystical dimensions of Feast is the very real sense that the spi-
rit of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá may be present when true unity is experienced:

> On that night thy house was the nest and the shelter of the birds of God. The
> divine melodies and the celestial lyres made that place a feast of heaven and
> an assembly of the Kingdom. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was present there in heart and soul
> and was joyful and happy. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas, 216)

Although no sacramental importance attaches to the Bahá’ı́ Feast, ‘Abdu’l-
Bahá attached great importance to it and, in doing so, compared the Bahá’ı́ Feast
to the “Lord’s Supper” among Christians:

> Thou hast written concerning the Feast. This festivity, which is held on a day of
> the nineteen-day month, was established by His Holiness the Báb, and the
> Blessed Beauty directed, confirmed and warmly encouraged the holding of it.
> It is, therefore, of the utmost importance. You should unquestionably see to it
> with the greatest care, and make its value known, so that it may become solidly
> established on a permanent basis. Let the beloved of God gather together and
> associate most lovingly and spiritually and happily with one another, conducting
> themselves with the greatest courtesy and self-restraint. Let them read the holy
> verses, as well as essays which are of benefit, and the letters of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá;
> encourage and inspire one another to love each and all; chant the prayers with
serenity and joy; give eloquent talks, and praise the matchless Lord.

The host, with complete self-effacement, showing kindness to all, must be
a comfort to each one, and serve the friends with his own hands.

If the Feast is befittingly held, in the manner described, then this supper
> will verily be the Lord’s Supper, for its fruits will be the very fruits of that
> Supper, and its influence the same. (‘Abdu’l-Bahá, from a Tablet to an indi-
> vidual believer, translated from the Persian, The Nineteen Day Feast, 425.)

The devotional portion of the Feast is often themed by the name of that particu-
lar Bahá’ı́ month (i.e., “Honor,” “Loftiness,” “Power,” “Mercy,” etc.), although
there is no requirement to do so. The devotions will consist of selected readings
from Bahá’ı́ sacred texts and the recitation or chanting of Bahá’ı́ prayers (from
memory or reading a Bahá’ı́ prayer book). Music and singing may be included,
and following the Bahá’ı́ readings and prayers, creative or performative expres-
sions of Bahá’ı́ devotion may be integrated into the observance. Occasionally, pas-
sages from the scriptures of other world religions may be included in the Feast
program. The Feast is the only Bahá’ı́ event intended for the Bahá’ı́ community
alone other than elections, and thus not generally open, except that non-Bahá’ı́s
who may be present will be treated cordially as guests, and consultation on sensi-
tive community matters will be deferred.

Shoghi Effendi developed the administrative component by integrating into the
institution of the Feast a period of consultation on the affairs of the Bahá’ı́ community.

> Thus the consultative part of the Feast is when announcements of upcoming events
> are made, community affairs are discussed, consultation on topics of special concern
> is facilitated, where ideas and recommendations for consideration by the local Bahá’ı́
> council (i.e., the annually elected, nine-member “Local Spiritual Assembly” or
> “LSA”) are offered and recorded. Such consultation gives every member a voice in
> community affairs and thus makes the Feast an “arena of democracy at the very root
> of society” (Letter from the Universal House of Justice to the Bahá’ı́s of the World,
> August 27, 1989). Study topics of particular relevance may be presented for brief dis-
> cussion for the community’s edification, and the Bahá’ı́ youth and children may be
> invited to perform or make special presentations. Thus, the consultative portion has
> an educative function in addition to its administrative purpose. It is also a venue in
which the LSA may report its recent decisions to the Bahá’ı́ community.

The social time of the Feast, which is typically at the end, is vital for promoting
> unity among the “Bahá’ı́ friends” (as Bahá’ı́s are often called). Strength and vibrancy
> of the Bahá’ı́ community is, after all, coefficient with its unity and solidarity. The vital-
> ity of social cohesion often manifests itself in the percentage of the enrolled Bahá’ı́
> members who participate in their community Feasts, and this, in turn, may have a direct
impact on the level of giving to the Bahá’ı́ Fund, to which only Bahá’ı́s may contribute.

The Bahá’ı́ Faith has been established in every country except for the Vatican
> and North Korea, thus making it the second-most widespread religion in the world,
> next to Christianity. Today, the majority of the estimated six million Bahá’ı́s
> observe the Nineteen-Day Feast, which is an integral feature of Bahá’ı́ community
> life. In some Muslim states in the Middle East, this practice has become restricted.
> For example, the Islamic Republic of Iran has banned the practice as part of a sys-
> tematic campaign, since the Islamic Revolution of 1979 (and in earlier regimes), to
eradicate the Bahá’ı́ Faith in Iran.

The Nineteen-Day Feast is adaptable to a wide array of cultural contexts, which is
> an important feature, considering the fact that societies are becoming increasingly
> diverse. Music is often featured in the Feast program and typically reflects the
> Feast’s geographic and cultural milieu. In the United States, for instance, the Feast
> might well feature upbeat gospel-style music, while Feasts in Bahá’ı́ communities
> that are predominantly Native American, Native Canadian, or indigenous in Central
> and South America often incorporate cultural traditions as well; songs might be
> pentatonic in Bahá’ı́ feasts in Asia. The Feast experience is further enriched by
> Bahá’ı́ musicians around the world who, working in every genre and style and mix-
> ing them as well, set the Bahá’ı́ writings to music, becoming a robust source of
music not only for Feast, but for other Bahá’ı́ devotional activities as well.

Ideally, the Nineteen-Day Feast operates to make each local Bahá’ı́ community
> more tight-knit. This requires that the Bahá’ı́s themselves make it a priority and
> attach great importance to it. Although attendance at the Feast is not “obligatory”
> in the sense of being a Bahá’ı́ law, and no one is pressured to attend, every Bahá’ı́
> should consider it a duty and privilege to be present at Feast. As ‘Abdu’l-Bahá has
said: “As to the Nineteen Day Feast, it rejoiceth mind and heart. If this feast be

Nino, Saint’s Day of St. (January 14)          645

held in the proper fashion, the friends will, once in nineteen days, find themselves
spiritually restored, and endued with a power that is not of this world” (Selections
from the Writings of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, 91).

Nino, Saint’s Day of St. (January 14)

Nino (c. 296–c. 338), is part of a distinct minority of saints. She was a woman, she
was an active missionary for the Christian movement, and she died of natural
causes. She is also among the very few Orthodox saints remembered as “isaposto-
los” or equal to the apostles.

Nino, according to most traditional accounts, was from Cappadocia, an area
now in central Turkey, and was a relative of George, the Roman soldier who
became a Christian martyr and saint. It has been claimed that she was the daughter
of the Roman general Zabulon and, on her mother’s side, the niece of Houbnal I,
the Christian patriarch of Jerusalem. He facilitated her trip to Rome during which
she had a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary in which she was told to go to Iberia
(i.e., ancient Georgia) and given a cross as a protective spiritual shield.

While on her way to Iberia, she became part of a community of 37 virgins that the
beautiful Armenian Hripsime (or Rhipsime, d. c. 290 CE). They lived together under
the leadership of a man named Gayane. When the Armenian king Tiridates III took
