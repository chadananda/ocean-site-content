Rigpa Fellowship

Among the most popular books on Buddhism to be
published in the West in recent years is Sogyal Rin-
poche’s work, The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying.
When it was published in 1992, it introduced the
author and his relatively new Tibetan Buddhist organi-
zation, Rigpa, to many people.

The Rigpa Fellowship was established in the United
Kingdom in 1979 under the spiritual direction of Sog-
yal Rinpoche (b. ca. 1949). Born in Tibet in the late
1940s, Sogyal Rinpoche was brought up from an early
age by his master, Jamyang Khyentse Chokyi Lodro,
who recognized him as the incarnation of Terton Sog-
yal (1856–1926), a teacher to the 13th Dalai Lama. In
1971 Sogyal Rinpoche moved to the United Kingdom
in order to study comparative religion at Trinity Col-
lege, Cambridge. Soon after, he moved to London,
where he built up a small following of students and           Sogyal Rinpoche, founder of the Rigpa Fellowship, a
